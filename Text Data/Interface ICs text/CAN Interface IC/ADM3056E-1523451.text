  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining AUXOUT ≥ 2.4 V, CANH, CANL recessive, or RXD ≥ VDD1 − 0.2 V. |CML| is
  the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining AUXOUT ≤ 0.4 V, CANH, CANL dominant, or RXD ≤ 0.4 V. The common-mode
  voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

  The maximum continuous working voltage refers to the continuous voltage magnitude imposed across the isolation barrier. See the Insulation Lifetime section for
  more details.

  Insulation capability without regard to creepage limitations. Working voltage may be limited by the PCB creepage when considering rms voltages for components
  soldered to a PCB (assumes Material Group I up to 1250 V rms), or by the SOIC_IC package creepage of 8.3 mm, when considering rms voltages for Material Group II.

Pin No.     Mnemonic   Description
1           VDD1       Power Supply, Logic Side, 1.7 V to 5.5 V. This pin requires 0.1 µF and 0.01 µF decoupling capacitors.
2, 8        GND1       Ground, Logic Side.
3           RXD        Receiver Output Data.
4           SILENT     Silent Mode Select. Active with input high. Bring this input low or leave the pin unconnected (internal pull-down)
                       for normal mode.
5           TXD        Transmitter Input Data. This pin has a weak internal pull-up resistor to VDD1.
6           STBY       Standby Mode Select. Active with input high. Bring this input low or leave the pin unconnected (internal pull-
                       down) for normal mode.
7           AUXIN      Auxiliary Channel Input. This pin sets the AUXOUT output.
9, 13, 16   GND2       Ground, Bus Side.
10          RS         Slope Control Pin. Short this pin to ground for full speed operation or use a weak pull-down (for example, 47 kΩ)
                       for slope control mode. An input high signal places the CAN transceiver in standby.
11          CANL       CAN Low Input/Output.
12          CANH       CAN High Input/Output.
14          VDD2       Power Supply, Bus Side, 4.5 V to 5.5 V. This pin requires 0.1 µF and 0.01 µF decoupling capacitors.
15          AUXOUT     Isolated Auxiliary Channel Output per Auxiliary Input in Normal Mode. The state of AUXOUT is latched when STBY is
                       high. By default, AUXOUT is low at startup or when VDD1 is unpowered.
