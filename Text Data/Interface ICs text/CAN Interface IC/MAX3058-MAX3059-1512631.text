and differential receive capability to the CAN controller.         Standby Mode (MAX3058 Only)
The MAX3058 output common-mode range is from -7V               ♦ Thermal Shutdown
to +12V. The MAX3059 output common-mode range is               ♦ Current Limiting
from 0V to V CC. The MAX3059 contains an internal
switch termination resistor that makes it ideal for JetLink    ♦ ESD Protection

The MAX3058 features four different modes of opera-
tion: high speed, slope control, standby, and shutdown.
The MAX3059 features three different modes of opera-
tion: high speed, slope control, and shutdown. High-                                       Ordering Information

                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
