Description
The CAN-transceiver IFX1040SJ is a monolithic integrated circuit in a PG-DSO-8 package for high speed
differential mode data transmission (up to 1 Mbaud) and reception in industrial applications. It works as an
interface between the CAN protocol controller and the physical bus lines compatible to ISO Standard 11898-2 and
ISO Standard 11898-5.
The IFX1040SJ is designed to provide an excellent passive behavior when the transceiver is switched off and a
remote wake-up capability via CAN bus in low power mode. This supports networks with partially un-powered
nodes.
The IFX1040SJ has two operation modes, the normal and the stand-by mode. These modes can be chosen by
the STB pin. If the IFX1040SJ is in stand-by mode and a message on the bus is detected, the IFX1040SJ changes
the level at the RxD pin corresponding to the bus signal (wake-up flag).
The IFX1040SJ is designed to withstand the severe conditions of industrial applications.

The IFX1040SJ has two operation modes, the normal and the standby mode. These modes can be controlled with
the STB pin (see Figure 3, Table 2). The STB pin has an implemented pull-up, so if there is no signal applied to
STB or STB = HIGH, the standby mode is activated. To transfer the IFX1040SJ into the normal mode, STB has
to be switched to LOW.
                                                                              Normal

Normal Mode
This mode is designed for the normal data transmission/reception within the HS-CAN network.
Transmission
The signal from the μC is applied to the TxD input of the IFX1040SJ. Now the bus driver switches the CANH/L
output stages to transfer this input signal to the CAN bus lines.

TxD Time-out Feature
If the TxD signal is dominant for a time t > tTxD the TxD time-out function deactivates the transmitter of the IFX1040.
This is realized to prevent the bus from being blocked permanently dominant due to an error like in case of a
malfunctioning microcontroller.
The transmission is released again, after a rising edge at TxD has been detected.
As a result of the TxD Time-Out function, the minimum bit rate is limited. The minimum achievable bit rate can be
calculated by the maximum number of consecutive dominant bits allowed in the system. It is given by the
maximum number of dominant bits allowed in the system divided by the TxD permanent dominant disable time
t_TxD.
Reduced Electromagnetic Emission
The bus driver has an implemented control to reduce the electromagnetic emission (EME). This is achieved by
controlling the symmetry of the slope, resp. of CANH and CANL.
Overtemperature
The driver stages are protected against overtemperature. Exceeding the shutdown temperature results in
deactivation of the driving stages at CANH/L. To avoid a bit failure after cooling down, the signals can be
transmitted again only after a dominant to recessive edge at TxD.
Figure 4 shows the way how the transmission stage is deactivated and activated again. First an over temperature
condition causes the transmission stage to deactivate. After the over temperature condition is no longer present,
the transmission is only possible after the TxD signal has changed to recessive level.

Reception
The analog CAN bus signals are converted into a digital signal at RxD via the differential input receiver. The RxD
signal is switched to RxD output pin via the multiplexer (MUX), see Figure 2.
In normal mode the split pin is used to stabilize the recessive common mode signal.

Standby Mode
The standby mode is designed to switch the IFX1040SJ into a low power mode with minimum current
consumption. The driving stages and the receiver are deactivated. Only the relevant circuitry to guarantee a
correct handling of the CAN bus wake-up is still active. This wake-up receiver is also designed to show an
excellent immunity against electromagnetic noise (EMI).
Change into Standby Mode during CAN Bus Failure
It is possible to change from normal mode into the standby mode if the bus is dominant due to a bus failure without
setting the RxD wake flag to LOW. The advantage is, that the IFX1040SJ can be kept in the standby mode even
if a bus failure occurs.
Figure 5 shows this mechanism in detail. During a bus network failure, the bus might be dominant. Normal
communication is not possible until the failure is removed. To reduce the current consumption, it makes sense to
switch over to standby mode. This is possible with the IFX1040SJ. If the dominant signal switches back to
recessive level, e.g. failure removed, a wake-up via CAN bus (recessive to dominant signal detected) is possible.

Wake-up via CAN Message
During standby mode, a dominant CAN message on the bus longer than the filtering time t > tWU1, leads to the
activation of the wake-up. The wake-up during standby mode is signaled with the RxD output pin. A dominant
signal longer t > tWU1 on the CAN bus switches the RxD level to LOW, with a following recessive signal on the CAN
bus longer t > tWU2 the RxD level is switched to high, see Figure 6.
The μC is able to detect this change at RxD and switch the transceiver into the normal mode.

Split Circuit
The split circuitry is activated during normal mode and deactivated (SPLIT pin floating) during standby mode. The
SPLIT pin is used to stabilize the recessive common mode signal in normal mode. This is realized with a stabilized
voltage of 0.5 VCC at SPLIT.
A correct application of the SPLIT pin is shown in Figure 7. The split termination for the left and right node is
realized with two 60 Ω resistances and one 10 nF capacitor. The center node in this example is a stub node and
the recommended value for the split resistances is 1.5 kΩ.

Other Features
Fail Safe
If the device is supplied but there is no signal at the digital inputs, the TxD and STB have an internal pull-up path,
to prevent the transceiver to switch into the normal mode or send a dominant signal on the bus.
Un-supplied Node
The CANH/CANL pins remain high ohmic, if the transceiver is un-supplied.
