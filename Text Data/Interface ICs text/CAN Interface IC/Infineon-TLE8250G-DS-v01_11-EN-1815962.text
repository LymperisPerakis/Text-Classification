Description
The TLE8250G is a transceiver designed for CAN networks in automotive and industrial applications. As an
interface between the physical bus layer and the CAN protocol controller, the TLE8250G drives the signals to
the bus and protects the microcontroller against disturbances coming from the network. Based on the high
symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE8250G provides a very low level of electromagnetic emission
(EME) within a broad frequency range. The TLE8250G is integrated in a RoHS complaint PG-DSO-8 package and
fulfills or exceeds the requirements of the ISO11898-2.
As a successor to the first generation of HS CAN transceivers, the TLE8250G is fully pin and function compatible
to his predecessor model the TLE6250G. The TLE8250G is optimized to provide an excellent passive behavior
in Power Down mode. This feature makes the TLE8250G extremely suitable for mixed supply HS CAN
networks.

Functional Description
4            Functional Description
CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensor and actuators for real-time control
applications. The usage of the Control Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7 layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a
CAN bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes inside the
network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical
specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several
different physical layer definitions of a CAN network have been developed over the last years. The TLE8250G
is a High Speed CAN transceiver without any dedicated Wake-Up function. High Speed CAN Transceivers
without Wake-Up function are defined by the international standard ISO 11898-2.

TLE8250G
High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Functional Description
The TLE8250G is a High Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates up to 1 MBit/s. Characteristic for a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus: “Dominant”
and “Recessive” (see Figure 3).
The pins CANH and CANL are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as an input and as an output.
The pins RxD and TxD are the interface to the microcontroller. The pin TxD is the serial data input from the CAN
controller, the pin RxD is the serial data output to the CAN controller. As shown in Figure 1, the HS CAN
transceiver TLE8250G has a receive and a transmit unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the bus
medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver TLE8250G
converts the serial data stream available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output signal on
CAN bus, provided by the pins CANH and CANL. The receiver stage of the TLE8250G monitors the data on the
CAN bus and converts them to a serial, single ended signal on the RxD output pin. A logical “Low” signal on the
TxD pin creates a “Dominant” signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “Low” signal on the RxD pin (see
Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the CAN bus
simultaneous is essential to support the bit to bit arbitration inside CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined by the ISO 11898-2 and the ISO 11898-5 standards. If a
data bit is “Dominant” or “Recessive” depends on the voltage difference between pins CANH and CANL:
VDIFF = VCANH - VCANL.
In comparison to other differential network protocols the differential signal on a CAN network can only be
larger or equal to 0 V. To transmit a “Dominant” signal to the CAN bus the differential signal VDIFF is larger or
equal to 1.5 V. To receive a “Recessive” signal from the CAN bus the differential VDIFF is smaller or equal to 0.5 V.
Partially supplied CAN networks are networks where the CAN bus participants have different power supply
conditions. Some nodes are connected to the power supply, some other nodes are disconnected from the
power supply. Regardless, if the CAN bus participant is supplied or not supplied, each participant connected
to the common bus media must not disturb the communication. The TLE8250G is designed to support
partially supplied networks. In Power Down mode, the receiver input resistors are switched off and the
transceiver input is high resistive.
4.2            Operation Modes
Three different operation modes are available on TLE8250G. Each mode with specific characteristics in terms
of quiescent current or data transmission. For the mode selection the digital input pins NEN and NRM are used.
Figure 4 illustrates the different mode changes depending on the status of the NEN and NRM pins. After
suppling VCC to the HS CAN transceiver, the TLE8250G starts in Stand-By mode. The internal pull-up resistors
are setting the TLE8250G to Stand-By per default. If the microcontroller is up and running the TLE8250G can
change to any operation mode within the time for mode change tMode.

4.3          Normal Operation Mode
In Normal Operation mode the HS CAN transceiver TLE8250G sends the serial data stream on the TxD pin to
the CAN bus while at the same time the data available on the CAN bus are monitored to the RxD pin. In Normal
Operation mode all functions of the TLE8250G are active:
•   The output driver stage is active and drives data from the TxD to the CAN bus.
•   The receiver unit is active and provides the data from the CAN bus to the RxD pin.

TLE8250G
High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Functional Description
•   The bus basing is set to VCC/2.
•   The under-voltage monitoring on the power supply VCC is active.
To enter the Normal Operation mode set the pin NRM to logical “High” and the pin NEN to logical “Low” (see
Table 2 or Figure 4). Both pins, the NEN pin and the NRM pin have internal pull-up resistors to the power-
supply VCC.
4.4           Receive-Only Mode
The Receive-Only mode can be used to test the connection of the bus medium. The TLE8250G can still receive
data from the bus, but the output driver stage is disabled and therefore no data can be sent to the CAN bus.
All other functions are active:
•   The output driver stage is disabled and data which are available on the TxD pin are blocked and not send
    to the CAN bus.
•   The receiver unit is active and provides the data from the CAN bus to the RxD output pin.
•   The bus basing is set to VCC/2.
•   The under-voltage monitoring on the power supply VCC is active.
To enter the Receive-Only mode set the pin NRM to logical “Low” and the pin NEN to logical “Low” (see Table 2
or Figure 4). In case the Receive-Only mode will not be used, the NRM pin can be left open.
4.5           Stand-By Mode
Stand-By mode is an idle mode of the TLE8250G with optimized power consumption. In Stand-By mode the
TLE8250G can not send or receive any data. The output driver stage and the receiver unit are disabled. Both
CAN bus pins, CANH and CANL are floating.
•   The output driver stage is disabled.
•   The receiver unit is disabled.
•   The bus basing is floating.
•   The under-voltage monitoring on the power supply VCC is active.
To enter the Stand-By mode set the pin NEN to logical “High”, the logical state of the NRM pin has no influence
for the mode selection (see Table 2 or Figure 4). Both pins the NEN and the NRM pin have an internal pull-up
resistor to the power-supply VCC. If the Stand-By mode is not used in the application, the NEN pin needs to get
connected to GND.
In case the NRM pin is set to logical “Low” in Stand-By mode, the internal pull-up resistor causes an additional
quiescent current from VCC to GND, therefore it is recommended to set the NRM pin to logical “High” in Stand-
By mode or leave the pin open if the Receive-Only mode is not used in the application.
4.6           Power Down Mode
Power Down mode means the TLE8250G is not supplied. In Power Down the differential input resistors of the
receiver stage are switched off. The CANH and CANL bus interface of the TLE8250G acts as an high impedance
input with a very small leakage current. The high ohmic input doesn’t influence the “Recessive” level of the
CAN network and allows an optimized EME performance of the whole CAN network.

Fail Safe Functions
5             Fail Safe Functions
5.1           Short circuit protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short-circuit-proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device is heating up due to a continuos
short on CANH or CANL, the internal over-temperature protection switches off the bus transmitter.
5.2           Open Logic Pins
All logic input pins have internal pull-up resistor to VCC. In case the VCC supply is activated and the logical pins
are open or floating, the TLE8250G enters into the Stand-By mode per default. In Stand-By mode the output
driver stage of the TLE8250G is disabled, the bus biasing is shut off and the HS CAN transceiver TLE8250G will
not influence the data on the CAN bus.
5.3           TxD Time-Out function
The TxD Time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “Low”. A continuous “Low” signal on the TxD pin can have it’s root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or in a short on the printed circuit board for example. In Normal Operation mode, a logical
“Low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTXD the TLE8250G activates the TxD Time-out and the TLE8250G
disables the output driver stage (see Figure 5). The receive unit is still active and the data on the bus are
monitored at the RxD output pin.

Figure 5       TxD Time-Out function
Figure 5 shows how the output driver stage is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “Low” signal on
the TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the output driver stage. To release the
output driver stage after a TxD time-out event the TLE8250G requires a signal change on the TxD input pin
from logical “Low” to logical “High”.
5.4           Under-Voltage detection
The HS CAN Transceiver TLE8250G is equipped with an under-voltage detection on the power supply VCC. In
case of an under-voltage event on VCC, the under-voltage detection changes the operation mode of TLE8250G

High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Fail Safe Functions
The TLE8250G has an integrated over-temperature detection to protect the device against thermal overstress
of the output driver stage. In case of an over-temperature event, the temperature sensor will disable the
output driver stage (see Figure 1). After the device cools down the output driver stage is activated again (see
Figure 7).
Inside the temperature sensor a hysteresis is implemented.

TLE8250G
High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Application Information
8.2                             Output Characteristics of the RxD Pin
The RxD output pin is designed as a push-pull output stage (see Figure 1), meaning to produce a logical “Low”
signal the TLE8250G switches the RxD output to GND. Vice versa to produce a logical “High” signal the
TLE8250G switches the RxD output to VCC.
The level VRxD,H for a logical “High” signal on the RxD output depends on the load on the RxD output pin and
therefore on the RxD output current IRD,H. For a load against the GND potential, the current IRD,H is flowing out
of the RxD output pin.
Similar to the logical “High” signal, the level VRxD,L for a logical “Low” signal on the RxD output pin depends on
the output current IRD,L. For a load against the power supply VCC the current IRD,L is flowing into the RxD output
pin.
Currents flowing into the device are marked positive inside the data sheet and currents flowing out of the
device TLE8250G are marked negative inside the data sheet (see Table 6).

Figure 11                           RxD Output driver capability for a logical “High” signal1)
The diagram in Figure 11 shows the output current capability of the RxD output pin depended on the chip
temperature TJ. At a logical “High” signal VRxD,H = 4.6 V, the typical output current is between 5.7 mA for -40 °C
and 4.7 mA for a temperature of +150 °C. The dependency of the output current on the temperature is almost
linear. The upper curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typical output current + 6 sigma; VCC=5 V” reflects the expected
maximum value of the RxD output current of the TLE8250G.
The lower curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typical output current - 6 sigma; VCC=5 V” reflects the expected minimum value
of the RxD output current of the TLE8250G. All simulations are based on a power supply VCC = 5.0 V.
