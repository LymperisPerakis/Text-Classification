                  Rev. 5 — 6 December 2013                                            Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1055 is the interface between the protocol controller and the physical bus wires in
              a Controller Area Network (CAN). It is primarily intended for low-speed applications up to
              125 kBd in passenger cars. The device provides differential receive and transmit
              capability but will switch to single-wire transmitter and/or receiver in error conditions. The
              TJA1055 is the enhanced version of the TJA1054 and TJA1054A. TJA1055 has the same
              functionality but in addition offering a number of improvements. The most important
              improvements of the TJA1055 with respect to the TJA1054 and TJA1054A are:
                •  Improved ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) performance
                •  Lower current consumption in sleep mode
                •  Wake-up signalling on RXD and ERR without VCC active
                •  3 V interfacing with microcontroller possible with TJA1055T/3

7. Functional description
                       The TJA1055 is the interface between the CAN protocol controller and the physical wires
                       of the CAN bus (see Figure 7 and Figure 8). It is primarily intended for low-speed
                       applications, up to 125 kBd, in passenger cars. The device provides differential transmit
                       capability to the CAN bus and differential receive capability to the CAN controller.
                       To reduce EME, the rise and fall slopes are limited. This allows the use of an unshielded
                       twisted pair or a parallel pair of wires for the bus lines. Moreover, the device supports
                       transmission capability on either bus line if one of the wires is corrupted. The failure
                       detection logic automatically selects a suitable transmission mode.
                       In normal operating mode (no wiring failures) the differential receiver is output on pin RXD
                       (see Figure 1). The differential receiver inputs are connected to pins CANH and CANL
                       through integrated filters. The filtered input signals are also used for the single-wire
                       receivers. The receivers connected to pins CANH and CANL have threshold voltages that
                       ensure a maximum noise margin in single-wire mode.
                       A timer function (TxD dominant time-out function) has been integrated to prevent the bus
                       lines from being driven into a permanent dominant state (thus blocking the entire network
                       communication) due to a situation in which pin TXD is permanently forced to a LOW level,
                       caused by a hardware and/or software application failure.
                       If the duration of the LOW level on pin TXD exceeds a certain time, the transmitter will be
                       disabled. The timer will be reset by a HIGH level on pin TXD.
                   7.1 Failure detector
                       The failure detector is fully active in the normal operating mode. After the detection of a
                       single bus failure the detector switches to the appropriate mode (see Table 4). The
                       differential receiver threshold voltage is set at 3.2 V typical (VCC = 5 V). This ensures
                       correct reception with a noise margin as high as possible in the normal operating mode
                       and in the event of failures 1, 2, 5 and 6a. These failures, or recovery from them, do not
                       destroy ongoing transmissions. The output drivers remain active, the termination does not
                       change and the receiver remains in differential mode (see Table 4).
                       Failures 3, 3a and 6 are detected by comparators connected to the CANH and CANL bus
                       lines. Failures 3 and 3a are detected in a two-step approach. If the CANH bus line
                       exceeds a certain voltage level, the differential comparator signals a continuous dominant
                       condition. Because of inter operability reasons with the predecessor products TJA1054
                       and TJA1054A, after a first time-out the transceiver switches to single-wire operation
                       through CANH. If the CANH bus line is still exceeding the CANH detection voltage for a
                       second time-out, the TJA1055 switches to CANL operation; the CANH driver is switched
                       off and the RTH bias changes to the pull-down current source. The time-outs (delays) are
                       needed to avoid false triggering by external RF fields.

                   Failure 6 is detected if the CANL bus line exceeds its comparator threshold for a certain

                   detection of failure 6, the reception is switched to the single-wire mode through CANH; the
                   CANL driver is switched off and the RTL bias changes to the pull-up current source.

                   recessive level by corresponding comparators for a certain period of time.
                   Failures 4 and 7 initially result in a permanent dominant level on pin RXD. After a time-out
                   the CANL driver is switched off and the RTL bias changes to the pull-up current source.
                   Reception continues by switching to the single-wire mode via pins CANH or CANL. When
                   failures 4 or 7 are removed, the recessive bus levels are restored. If the differential
                   voltage remains below the recessive threshold level for a certain period of time, reception
                   and transmission switch back to the differential mode.
                   If any of the wiring failure occurs, the output signal on pin ERR will be set to LOW. On
                   error recovery, the output signal on pin ERR will be set to HIGH again. In case of an
                   interrupted open bus wire, this failure will be detected and signalled only if there is an
                   open wire between the transmitting and receiving node(s). Thus, during open wire
                   failures, pin ERR typically toggles.
                   During all single-wire transmissions, EMC performance (both immunity and emission) is
                   worse than in the differential mode. The integrated receiver filters suppress any HF noise
                   induced into the bus wires. The cut-off frequency of these filters is a compromise between
                   propagation delay and HF suppression. In single-wire mode, LF noise cannot be
                   distinguished from the required signal.

                   7.2 Low power modes
                       The transceiver provides three low power modes which can be entered and exited via
                        STB and EN (see Table 5 and Figure 3).
                       The sleep mode is the mode with the lowest power consumption. Pin INH is switched to
                       HIGH-impedance for deactivation of the external voltage regulator. Pin CANL is biased to
                       the battery voltage via pin RTL. Pins RXD and ERR will signal the wake-up interrupt even
                       in case VCC is not present.
                       The standby mode operates in the same way as the sleep mode but with a HIGH level on
                       pin INH.
                       The power-on standby mode is the same as the standby mode, however, in this mode the
                       battery power-on flag is shown on pin ERR instead of the wake-up interrupt signal. The
                       output on pin RXD will show the wake-up interrupt. This mode is only for reading out the
                       power-on flag.

                       [1]  Wake-up interrupts are released when entering normal operating mode.
                       [2]  For TJA1055T a diode is added in series with the high-side driver of ERR and RXD to prevent a reverse
                            current from ERR to VCC in the unpowered state.
                       [3]  For TJA1055T/3, ERR and RXD are open-drain.
                       [4]  In case the goto-sleep command was used before. When VCC drops, pin EN will become LOW, but due to
                            the fail-safe functionality this does not effect the internal functions.
                       [5]  VBAT power-on flag will be reset when entering normal operating mode.
                       Wake-up requests are recognized by the transceiver through two possible channels:
                         • The bus lines for remote wake-up
                         • Pin WAKE for local wake-up
                       In order to wake-up the transceiver remotely through the bus lines, a filter mechanism is
                       integrated. This mechanism makes sure that noise and any present bus failure conditions
                       do not result into an erroneous wake-up. Because of this mechanism it is not sufficient to
                       simply pull the CANH or CANL bus lines to a dominant level for a certain time. To
                       guarantee a successful remote wake-up under all conditions, a message frame with a
                       dominant phase of at least the maximum specified tdom(CANH) or tdom(CANL) in it is required.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                             TJA1055
                                                                                                        Enhanced fault-tolerant CAN transceiver
                       A local wake-up through pin WAKE is detected by a rising or falling edge with a
                       consecutive level exceeding the maximum specified tWAKE.
                       On a wake-up request the transceiver will set the output on pin INH to HIGH which can be
                       used to activate the external supply voltage regulator.
                       A wake-up request is signalled on ERR or RXD with an active LOW signal. So the external
                       microcontroller can activate the transceiver (switch to normal operating mode) via
                       pins STB and EN.
                       To prevent a false remote wake-up due to transients or RF fields, the wake-up voltage
                       levels have to be maintained for a certain period of time. In the low power modes the
                       failure detection circuit remains partly active to prevent an increased power consumption
                       in the event of failures 3, 3a, 4 and 7.
                       To prevent a false local wake-up during an open wire at pin WAKE, this pin has a weak
                       pull-up current source towards VBAT. However, in order to protect the transceiver against
                       any EMC immunity issues, it is recommended to connect a not used pin WAKE to pin
                       BAT. Pin INH is set to floating only if the goto-sleep command is entered successfully. To
                       enter a successful goto-sleep command under all conditions, this command must be kept
                       stable for the maximum specified td(sleep).
                       Pin INH will be set to a HIGH level again by the following events only:
                         • VBAT power-on (cold start)
                         • Rising or falling edge on pin WAKE
                         • A message frame with a dominant phase of at least the maximum specified tdom(CANH)
                            or tdom(CANL), while pin EN or pin STB is at a LOW level
                         • Pin STB goes to a HIGH level with VCC active
                       To provide fail-safe functionality, the signals on pins STB and EN will internally be set to
                       LOW when VCC is below a certain threshold voltage (VCC(stb)). An unused output pin INH
                       can simply be left open within the application.
                   7.3 Power-on
                       After power-on (VBAT switched on) the signal on pin INH will become HIGH and an internal
                       power-on flag will be set. This flag can be read in the power-on standby mode through
                       pin ERR (STB = 1; EN = 0) and will be reset by entering the normal operating mode.
                   7.4 Protections
                       A current limiting circuit protects the transmitter output stages against short-circuit to
                       positive and negative battery voltage.
                       If the junction temperature exceeds the typical value of 175 C, the transmitter output
                       stages are disabled. Because the transmitter is responsible for the major part of the power
                       dissipation, this will result in a reduced power dissipation and hence a lower chip
                       temperature. All other parts of the device will continue to operate.
                       The pins CANH and CANL are protected against electrical transients which may occur in
                       an automotive environment.

                             VTXD is a rectangular signal of 50 kHz with 50 % duty cycle and slope time < 10 ns.
                             Termination resistors RCAN_L and RCAN_H (125 ) are not connected to pin RTL or pin RTH for
                             testing purposes because the minimum load allowed on the CAN bus lines is 500  per

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 10) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 10 and 11
