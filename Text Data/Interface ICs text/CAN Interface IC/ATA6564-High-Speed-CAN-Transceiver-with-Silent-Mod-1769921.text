1.1.1        NORMAL MODE                                           Please note that the device cannot enter Normal mode

A low level on the S pin together with a high level on
pin TXD selects the Normal mode. In this mode the
transceiver is able to transmit and receive data via the
CANH and CANL bus lines (see Section “Functional
Block Diagram”). The output driver stage is active
and drives data from the TXD input to the CAN bus.
The high-speed comparator (HSC) converts the
analog data on the bus lines into digital data which is
output to pin RXD. The bus biasing is set to VVCC/2
and the undervoltage monitoring of VCC is active.
The slope of the output signals on the bus lines is
controlled and optimized in a way that ensures the
lowest possible electromagnetic emission (EME).
To switch the device in normal operating mode, set the
S pin to low and the TXD pin to high (see Table 1-1
and Figure 1-2). The S pin provides a pull-down
resistor to GND, thus ensuring a defined level if the pin
is open.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
