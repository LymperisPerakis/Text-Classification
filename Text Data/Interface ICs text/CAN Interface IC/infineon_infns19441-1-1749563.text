Description
The TLE6251D is a transceiver designed for CAN networks in automotive and industrial applications. As an
interface between the physical bus layer and the CAN protocol controller, the TLE6251D drives the signals to the
bus and protects the microcontroller against interferences generated within the network. Based on the high
symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE6251D provides a very low level of electromagnetic emission
(EME) within a wide frequency range. The TLE6251D is integrated into a RoHS compliant PG-DSO-8-16 package
and fulfills or exceeds the requirements of the ISO11898-2 / -5.
The TLE6251D allows very low quiescent currents in stand-by mode while the device is still able to wake-up by a
bus signal on the CAN bus. Based on the very low leakage currents on the CAN bus interface the TLE6251D
provides an excellent passive behavior in power-down state. These and other features make the TLE6251D
especially suitable for mixed supply CAN networks.
Based on the Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT, the TLE6251D provides excellent ESD immunity together
with a very high electromagnetic immunity (EMI). The TLE6251D and the Infineon SPT technology are AEC
qualified and tailored to withstand the harsh conditions of the Automotive Environment.
Two different operation modes, additional fail-safe features like a TxD time-out, and the optimized output slew
rates on the CANH and CANL signals make the TLE6251D the ideal choice for large CAN networks with high data
transmission rates.

CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control applications.
The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by the international
standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model, the physical layer of a CAN bus system
specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within the network. The
physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical specifications of a CAN
network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several different physical layer standards
of CAN networks have been developed in recent years. The TLE6251D is a High Speed CAN transceiver with a
dedicated bus wake-up function and defined by the international standard ISO 11898-2.

                                                                                                       TLE6251D
                                                                                            Functional Description
The TLE6251D is a High Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two-wire, differential network, which allows data transmission rates
up to 1 Mbps. The characteristics for a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus: “dominant” and
“recessive” (see Figure 3).
The CANH and CANL pins are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as an input and output. The
RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the microcontroller. The TxD pin is the serial data input from the CAN
controller, the RxD pin is the serial data output to the CAN controller. As shown in Figure 1, the HS CAN
transceiver TLE6251D includes a receiver and a transmitter unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the bus
medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D
converts the serial data stream which is available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output signal
on the CAN bus, provided by the pins CANH and CANL. The receiver stage of the TLE6251D monitors the data
on the CAN bus and converts them to a serial, single-ended signal on the RxD output pin. A logical “low” signal
on the TxD pin creates a “dominant” signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “low” signal on the RxD pin (see
Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the CAN bus
simultaneously is essential to support the bit-to-bit arbitration within CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined by the ISO 11898-2 and the ISO 11898-5 standards.
Whether a data bit is “dominant” or “recessive” depends on the voltage difference between the CANH and CANL
pins: VDIFF = VCANH - VCANL.
In comparison with other differential network protocols, the amplitude of the differential signal on a CAN network
can only be higher than or equal to 0 V. To transmit a “dominant” signal to the CAN bus, the amplitude of the
differential signal VDIFF is higher than or equal to 1.5 V. To receive a “recessive” signal from the CAN bus, the
amplitude of the differential VDIFF is lower than or equal to 0.5 V.
“Partially-supplied” High Speed CAN networks are networks in which the CAN bus nodes of one common network
have different power supply conditions. Some nodes are connected to the common power supply, while other
nodes are disconnected from the power supply and in power-down state. Regardless of whether the CAN bus
subscriber is supplied or not, each subscriber connected to the common bus media must not interfere with the
communication. The TLE6251D is designed to support “partially-supplied” networks. In the power-down state, the
receiver input resistors are switched off and the transceiver input has a high resistance.
For permanently supplied ECUs, the HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D provides a stand-by mode. In stand-by
mode, the power consumption of the TLE6251D is optimized to a minimum, while the device is still able to
recognize wake-up patterns on the CAN bus and signal a wake-up event to the external microcontroller.
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level at the
VIO pin. Depending on the voltage level at the VIO pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (STB, TxD and RxD) are
compatible with microcontrollers having a 5 V or 3.3 V I/O supply. Usually, the VIO power supply of the transceiver
is connected to the same power supply as the I/O power supply of the microcontroller.

4.2            Modes of Operation
Two different modes of operation are available on the TLE6251D. Each mode has specific characteristics in terms
of quiescent current or data transmission. The digital input pin STB is used for the mode selection. Figure 4
illustrates the different mode changes depending on the status of the STB pin. After supplying VCC and VIO to the
HS CAN transceiver, the TLE6251D starts in stand-by mode. The internal pull-up resistor at the STB pin sets the
TLE6251D to stand-by mode by default. If the microcontroller is up and running, the TLE6251D can switch to any
operating mode within the time period for mode change tMODE.

4.3           Normal-operating Mode
In the normal-operating mode, the HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D sends the serial data stream on the TxD pin to
the CAN bus. The data on the CAN bus is displayed at the RxD pin simultaneously. In normal-operating mode, all
functions of the TLE6251D are active:
•   The transmitter is active and drives data from the TxD to the CAN bus.
•   The receiver is active and provides the data from the CAN bus to the RxD pin.
•   The low-power receiver is disabled.
•   The bus basing is set to VCC/2.
•   The undervoltage monitoring on the power supply VCC and on the power supply VIO is active.
•   The overtemperature protection is active.
To enter the normal-operating mode, set the STB pin to logical “low” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The STB pin has
an internal pull-up resistor to the power-supply VIO.
4.4           Stand-by Mode
Stand-by mode is an idle mode of the TLE6251D with optimized power consumption. In stand-by mode, the
TLE6251D can not send or receive any data. The normal mode receiver is switched off and only the low-power
receiver is active. An additional filter, implemented inside the low-power receiver ensures that only “dominant” and
“recessive” signals on the CAN bus, which are longer than the bus wake-up time tWU are indicated at the RxD
output pin.
•   The transmitter is disabled, and permanently “recessive”.
•   The input TxD is disabled.
•   The normal mode receiver is disabled.
•   The low-power receiver is active.
•   The RxD output is “high”, in case no wake-up signal on the CAN bus is detected (see Figure 5).
•   The RxD output toggles according to the wake-up signal on the CAN bus (see Figure 5).
•   The undervoltage monitoring on the power supply VCC is disabled.
•   The undervoltage monitoring on the power supply VIO is active.
•   The bus biasing is set to GND.
•   The overtemperature protection is not active.
To enter the stand-by mode, set the pin STB to logical “high” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The STB pin has an
internal pull-up resistor to the power-supply VIO. In case the stand-by mode is not be used in the final application,
the STB pin needs to get connected to GND.
4.5           Power-down State
The power-down state means that the TLE6251D is not supplied. In the power-down state, the differential input
resistors of the receiver are switched off. The CANH and CANL bus interface of the TLE6251D acts as a high-
impedance input with a very small leakage current. The high-ohmic input does not influence the “recessive” level
of the CAN network and allows an optimized EME performance of the entire CAN network.

4.6           Remote Wake-up
The TLE6251D has a remote wake-up feature, also called bus wake-up feature. In stand-by mode, the low-power
receiver monitors the activity on the CAN bus and in case it detects a wake-up signal, the TLE6251D indicates the
wake-up signal on the RxD output pin.
While entering into stand-by mode by setting the STB pin to logical “high”, the RxD output pin is set to logical “high”,
regardless of the signal on the CAN bus. The low-power receiver of the TLE6251D requires a signal change from
“recessive” to “dominant” on the CAN bus before the RxD output is enabled and follows the signal on the CAN bus.
CAN bus signals, “dominant” or “recessive”, with a pulse width above the bus wake-up time t > tWU are indicated
on the RxD output pin (see Figure 5).
The wake-up logic is supplied by the power supply VIO (see Figure 1). In case the TLE6251D is in stand-by mode,
the power supply VCC can be turned off, while the TLE6251D is still able to detect the wake-up pattern on the CAN
bus.

4.7           Voltage Adaption to the Microcontroller Supply
The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D has two different power supplies, VCC and VIO. The power supply VCC supplies
the transmitter and the normal mode receiver, the power supply VIO supplies the digital input and output buffers,
the low-power receiver and the wake-up logic. To adjust the digital input and output levels of the TLE6251D to the
I/O levels of the external microcontroller, the power supply VIO should be connected to the microcontroller pad
supply (see Figure 13).
Supplying the low-power receiver by the VIO pin allows to switch off the VCC supply in stand-by mode and leads to
an additional reduction of the quiescent current in stand-by mode.

5.1            Short-circuit Protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short-circuit proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device heats up due to a continuous short
on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus transmitter.
5.2            Unconnected Logical Pins
All logical input pins have an internal pull-up resistor to VIO. In case the VIO supply is activated and the logical pins
are open or floating, the TLE6251D enters the stand-by mode by default. In stand-by mode, the transmitter of the
TLE6251D is disabled, the bus bias is turned off and the input resistors of CANH and CANL are connected to GND.
The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D will not influence the data on the CAN bus.
5.3            TxD Time-out Function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the TxD
pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin can have its root cause in a locked-up
microcontroller or in a short on the printed circuit board, for example. In normal-operating mode, a logical “low”
signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out feature and the TLE6251D disables the
transmitter (see Figure 6). The receive unit is still active and the data on the bus continue to be monitored by the
RxD output pin.

Figure 6       TxD Time-out function
Figure 6 shows how the transmitter is deactivated and re-activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the TxD
input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter after a TxD
time-out event, the TLE6251D requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to logical “high”.

5.4            Undervoltage Detection
The HS CAN Transceiver TLE6251D is provided with undervoltage detection on the power supply VCC and the
power supply VIO. Both undervoltage detection monitors are active in normal-operating mode. In stand-by mode
only the VIO undervoltage monitoring is active, the VCC undervoltage monitoring is disabled.
In case the power supply VCC or VIO drops below a voltage level where the transceiver TLE6251D cannot securely
send data to the bus or receive data from the bus, the undervoltage detection disables the data communication
(see Figure 7).
The transmitter and the receiver are disabled, but the bus biasing remains connected to VCC/2. With a falling VCC
supply, the “recessive” level of the CAN bus signal decreases respectively.

5.5           Overtemperature Protection
The TLE6251D has an integrated overtemperature detection circuit to protect the TLE6251D against thermal
overstress of the transmitter. The overtemperature protection is active in normal-operating mode and disabled in
stand-by mode. In case of an overtemperature condition, the temperature sensor will disable the transmitter (see
Figure 1) while the transceiver remains in normal-operating mode.
After the device cools down the transmitter is activated again (see Figure 8). A hysteresis is implemented within
the temperature sensor.

5.6           Mode Changes during CAN Bus Failures
Failures on the CAN bus, like for example a short to the battery supply, might cause a permanent “dominant” signal
on the CAN bus and block the communication. Disregarding the signal on the CAN bus, the HS CAN transceiver
TLE6251D can change its operating mode from normal-operating mode to stand-by mode and vice versa.
While entering stand-by mode by setting the STB pin to logical “high”, the RxD output pin is set to logical “high”,
regardless if the CAN bus signal is “recessive” or “dominant”.
In stand-by mode the TLE6251D requires a mode change from “recessive” to “dominant” once, before the RxD
output follows the signals on the CAN bus. After detecting one signal change from “recessive” to “dominant” on
the CAN bus; a “recessive” CAN bus signal is indicated on the RxD output pin by a logical “high” signal and a
“dominant” CAN bus signal is indicated by a logical “low” signal, as long the pulse width of the CAN bus signals is
above the bus wake-up time t > tWU (see Figure 9).

5.7          Delay Time for Mode Change
During the mode change from stand-by mode to normal-operating mode or vice versa, the internal receive unit
switches from the low-power receiver to the normal mode receiver and vice versa. In order to avoid any bit toggling
on the RxD output pin, the RxD output is set to logical “high” during the mode change for the time tMode (see
Figure 10) and is not reflecting the signal on the CAN bus.
