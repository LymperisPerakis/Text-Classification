                  Rev. 6 ‚Äî 24 August 2017                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1057 is part of the Mantis family of high-speed CAN transceivers. It provides an
              interface between a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical
              two-wire CAN bus. The transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the
              automotive industry, providing the differential transmit and receive capability to (a
              microcontroller with) a CAN protocol controller.
              The TJA1057 offers a feature set optimized for 12 V automotive applications, with
              significant improvements over first- and second-generation CAN transceivers from NXP,
              such as the TJA1050, and excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance.
              The TJA1057 also displays ideal passive behavior to the CAN bus when the supply
              voltage is off.
              A VIO pin on the TJA1057GT(K)/3 variants allows for direct interfacing with 3.3 V and
              5 V-supplied microcontrollers.
              The TJA1057 implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. The TJA1057T is specified for data rates up to 1 Mbit/s.
              Additional timing parameters defining loop delay symmetry are specified for the other
              variants. This implementation enables reliable communication in the CAN FD fast phase
              at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
              These features make the TJA1057 an excellent choice for HS-CAN networks that only
              require basic CAN functionality.

7. Functional description
                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1057 supports two operating modes, Normal and Silent. The operating mode is
                       selected via pin S. See Table 4 for a description of the operating modes under normal
                       supply conditions.

                                                                                                                               HIGH when bus recessive

                                                                                                                               HIGH when bus recessive
                       [1]  ‚Äòx‚Äô = don‚Äôt care.
                7.1.1 Normal mode
                       A LOW level on pin S selects Normal mode. In this mode, the transceiver can transmit and
                       receive data via the bus lines, CANH and CANL (see Figure 1 for the block diagram). The
                       differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data which is
                       output on pin RXD. The slopes of the output signals on the bus lines are controlled
                       internally and are optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible EME.
                7.1.2 Silent mode
                       A HIGH level on pin S selects Silent mode. The transmitter is disabled in Silent mode,
                       releasing the bus pins to recessive state. All other IC functions, including the receiver,
                       continue to operate as in Normal mode. Silent mode can be used to prevent a faulty CAN
                       controller disrupting all network communications.
                   7.2 Fail-safe features
                7.2.1 TXD dominant time-out function
                       A 'TXD dominant time-out' timer is started when pin TXD is set LOW. If the LOW state on
                       this pin persists for longer than tto(dom)TXD, the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                       lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                       failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                       communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD is set HIGH.
                       The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of
                       approximately 25 kbit/s.
                7.2.2 Internal biasing of TXD and S input pins
                       Pins TXD and S have internal pull-ups to VCC (or VIO in TJA1057GT(K)/3 variants) to
                       ensure a safe, defined state in case one or both of these pins are left floating. Pull-up
                       currents flow in these pins in all states; both pins should be held HIGH in Silent mode to
                       minimize supply current.

                                                                                                                 High-speed CAN transceiver
                7.2.3 Undervoltage detection on pins VCC and VIO (TJA1057GT(K)/3)
                      If VCC or VIO drops below the undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(VCC)/Vuvd(VIO), the
                      transceiver switches off and disengages from the bus (zero load; bus pins floating) until
                      the supply voltage has recovered. The output drivers are enabled once both VCC and VIO
                      are again within their operating ranges and TXD has been reset to HIGH.
                7.2.4 Overtemperature protection
                      The output drivers are protected against overtemperature conditions. If the virtual junction
                      temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), both output drivers are
                      disabled. When the virtual junction temperature drops below Tj(sd) again, the output
                      drivers recover once TXD has been reset to HIGH (waiting for TXD to go HIGH prevents
                      output driver oscillation due to small variations in temperature).
                7.2.5 VIO supply pin (TJA1057x/3 variants)
                      Pin VIO should be connected to the microcontroller supply voltage (see Figure 6). The
                      signal levels on pins TXD, RXD and S will then be adjusted to the I/O levels of the
                      microcontroller, allowing for direct interfacing without additional glue logic.
                      For versions of the TJA1057 without a VIO pin, the VIO input is internally connected to VCC.
                      The signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and S are set to levels compatible with 5 V
                      microcontrollers.

[1]   Only TJA1057GT/3 and TJA1057GTK/3 have a VIO pin; the VIO input is internally connected to VCC in the other variants.
[2]   Factory testing uses correlated test conditions to cover the specified temperature and power supply voltage range.
[3]   VIO = VCC in non-VIO product variants TJA1057(G)T(K).
[4]   Not tested in production; guaranteed by design.

                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 ‚ÄúSurface mount reflow
                     soldering description‚Äù.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       ‚Ä¢ Through-hole components
                       ‚Ä¢ Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       ‚Ä¢  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       ‚Ä¢  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       ‚Ä¢  Package placement
                       ‚Ä¢  Inspection and repair
                       ‚Ä¢  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       ‚Ä¢ Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢ Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       ‚Ä¢ Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       ‚Ä¢ Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.
