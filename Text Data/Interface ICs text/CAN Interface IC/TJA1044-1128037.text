                  Rev. 6 — 24 August 2017                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1044 is part of the Mantis family of high-speed CAN transceivers. It provides an
              interface between a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical
              two-wire CAN bus. The transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the
              automotive industry, providing the differential transmit and receive capability to (a
              microcontroller with) a CAN protocol controller.
              The TJA1044 offers a feature set optimized for 12 V automotive applications, with
              significant improvements over NXP's first- and second-generation CAN transceivers, such
              as the TJA1040 and TJA1042, and excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
              performance. Additionally, the TJA1044 features:
                • Ideal passive behavior to the CAN bus when the supply voltage is off
                • A very low-current Standby mode with bus wake-up capability
                • Excellent EMC performance at speeds up to 500 kbit/s, even without a common mode
                   choke
                • TJA1044GT/3 and TJA1044GTK/3 can be interfaced directly to microcontrollers with
                   supply voltages from 3 V to 5 V
              These features make the TJA1044 an excellent choice for all types of HS-CAN networks,
              in nodes that require a low-power mode with wake-up capability via the CAN bus.
              The TJA1044 implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. The TJA1044T is specified for data rates up to 1 Mbit/s.
              Additional timing parameters defining loop delay symmetry are specified for the other
              variants. This implementation enables reliable communication in the CAN FD fast phase
              at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.

7. Functional description
                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1044 supports two operating modes, Normal and Standby. The operating mode is
                       selected via pin STB. See Table 4 for a description of the operating modes under normal
                       supply conditions.

                                                                                                                       HIGH when no wake-up detected
                       [1]  ‘x’ = don’t care.
                7.1.1 Normal mode
                       A LOW level on pin STB selects Normal mode. In this mode, the transceiver can transmit
                       and receive data via the bus lines CANH and CANL (see Figure 1 for the block diagram).
                       The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data which is
                       output on pin RXD. The slopes of the output signals on the bus lines are controlled
                       internally and are optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible EME.
                7.1.2 Standby mode
                       A HIGH level on pin STB selects Standby mode. In Standby mode, the transceiver is not
                       able to transmit or correctly receive data via the bus lines. The transmitter and
                       Normal-mode receiver blocks are switched off to reduce supply current, and only a
                       low-power differential receiver monitors the bus lines for activity.
                       In Standby mode, the bus lines are biased to ground to minimize system supply current.
                       The low-power receiver is supplied from VIO (VCC in non-VIO variants) and can detect CAN
                       bus activity even if VIO is the only available supply voltage. Pin RXD follows the bus after
                       a wake-up request has been detected. A transition to Normal mode is triggered when STB
                       is forced LOW.
                   7.2 Remote wake-up (via the CAN bus)
                       The TJA1044 wakes up from Standby mode when a dedicated wake-up pattern (specified
                       in ISO 11898-2:2016) is detected on the bus. This filtering helps avoid spurious wake-up
                       events. A spurious wake-up sequence could be triggered by, for example, a dominant
                       clamped bus or by dominant phases due to noise or spikes on the bus.
                       The wake-up pattern consists of:
                         • a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom) followed by
                         • a recessive phase of at least twake(busrec) followed by
                         • a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom)

                             Dominant or recessive bits between the above mentioned phases that are shorter than
                             twake(busdom) and twake(busrec) respectively are ignored.
                             The complete dominant-recessive-dominant pattern must be received within tto(wake)bus to
                             be recognized as a valid wake-up pattern (see Figure 3). Otherwise, the internal wake-up
                             logic is reset. The complete wake-up pattern will then need to be retransmitted to trigger a
                             wake-up event. Pin RXD remains HIGH until the wake-up event has been triggered.
                             After a wake-up sequence has been detected, the TJA1044 will remain in Standby mode
                             with the bus signals reflected on RXD. Note that dominant or recessive phases lasting
                             less than tfltr(wake)bus will not be detected by the low-power differential receiver and will not
                             be reflected on RXD in Standby mode.
                             A wake-up event is not flagged on RXD if any of the following events occurs while a valid
                             wake-up pattern is being received:
                                • The TJA1044 switches to Normal mode
                                • The complete wake-up pattern was not received within tto(wake)bus
                                • A VCC or VIO undervoltage is detected (VCC < Vuvd(swoff)(VCC) or VIO < Vuvd(swoff)(VIO);

                   7.3.1 TXD dominant time-out function
                             A 'TXD dominant time-out' timer is started when pin TXD is set LOW. If the LOW state on
                             this pin persists for longer than tto(dom)TXD, the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                             lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                             failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                             communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD is set HIGH.
                             The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of
                             approximately 25 kbit/s.

                                                                                       High-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                7.3.2 Internal biasing of TXD and STB input pins
                       Pins TXD and STB have internal pull-ups to VCC (VIO for variants with a VIO pin) to ensure
                       a safe, defined state in case one or both of these pins are left floating. Pull-up currents
                       flow in these pins in all states; both pins should be held HIGH in Standby mode to
                       minimize supply current.
                7.3.3 Undervoltage detection on pins VCC and VIO
                       If VCC drops below the standby undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(stb)(VCC), the transceiver
                       switches to Standby mode. The logic state of pin STB is ignored until VCC has recovered.
                       In versions with a VIO pin, if VIO drops below the switch-off undervoltage detection level
                       (Vuvd(swoff)(VIO)), the transceiver switches off and disengages from the bus (zero load) until
                       VIO has recovered.
                       In versions without a VIO pin, if VCC drops below the switch-off undervoltage detection
                       level (Vuvd(swoff)(VCC)), the transceiver switches off and disengages from the bus (zero
                       load) until VCC has recovered.
                7.3.4 Overtemperature protection
                       The output drivers are protected against overtemperature conditions. If the virtual junction
                       temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), both output drivers are
                       disabled. When the virtual junction temperature drops below Tj(sd) again, the output
                       drivers recover once TXD has been reset to HIGH. Including the TXD condition prevents
                       output driver oscillation due to small variations in temperature.
                   7.4 VIO supply pin (TJA1044x/3 variants)
                       Pin VIO should be connected to the microcontroller supply voltage (see Figure 7). This will
                       adjust the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and STB to the I/O levels of the microcontroller.
                       Pin VIO also provides the internal supply voltage for the low-power differential receiver in
                       the transceiver. For applications running in low-power mode, this allows the bus lines to
                       be monitored for activity even if there is no supply voltage on pin VCC.
                       For variants of the TJA1044 without a VIO pin, all circuitry is connected to VCC (pin 5 is not
                       bonded). The signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and STB are then compatible with 5 V
                       microcontrollers. This allows the device to interface with both 3.3 V and 5 V-supplied
                       microcontrollers, provided the microcontroller I/Os are 5 V tolerant.

[1]   Only TJA1044x/3 variants have a VIO pin; all circuitry is connected to VCC in the other variants.
[2]   Factory testing uses correlated test conditions to cover the specified temperature and power supply voltage range.
[3]   VIO = VCC in non-VIO product variants..
[4]   Not tested in production; guaranteed by design.
[5]   The test circuit used to measure the bus output voltage symmetry (which includes CSPLIT) is shown in Figure 9.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 12) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 12.
