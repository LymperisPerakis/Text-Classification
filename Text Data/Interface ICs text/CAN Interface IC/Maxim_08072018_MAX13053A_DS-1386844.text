the TXD input. When TXD remains in the dominant state
(low) for longer than TDOM, the driver is switched to the
recessive state, releasing the bus. The MAX13053A
features a S pin where it enables and disables the
transmitter for applications where you need the
transceiver to receive only. The MAX13054A features a
STBY pin for 3 modes of operation; standby mode for low
current consumption, normal high speed mode, or a slow
slew rate mode when an external 26.1kΩ is connected
between ground and STBY pin.
The MAX13053A and MAX13054A are available in a
standard 8-pin SOIC package, and operate over the
-40°C to +125°C temperature range.

Note 1: All units are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: Not production tested. Guaranteed at TA = 25°C.
Note 3: LED full-scale current maximum value is subjected to string number, LED number per string, and LX current limit. In SMBus
         modes, if the total load is heavier than eight strings with ten WLEDs per string at 25mA LED current, upon step-up regulator
         input VS removal, an OC fault may occur, resulting in SMBus status register OV_CURR and FAULT bits being set to 1 and
         violating SMBus specifications.
