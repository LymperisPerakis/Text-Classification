AMIS-41682, AMIS-41683
Fault Tolerant CAN
Transceiver
Description
  The new AMIS−41682 and AMIS−41683 are interfaces between the
protocol controller and the physical wires of the bus lines in a control
area network (CAN). AMIS−41683 is identical to the AMIS−41682                                     www.onsemi.com
but has a true 3.3 V digital interface to the CAN controller. The device
provides differential transmit capability but will switch in error                                PIN ASSIGNMENT
conditions to a single−wire transmitter and/or receiver. Initially it will
be used for low speed applications, up to 125 kB, in passenger cars.
