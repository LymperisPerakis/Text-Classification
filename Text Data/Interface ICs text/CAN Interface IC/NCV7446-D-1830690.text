Dual CAN FD Transceiver,
High Speed, Low Power
NCV7446
Description
   NCV7446 is a dual CAN FD physical layer transceiver. It allows
interfacing of two independent CAN physical buses and two                                  www.onsemi.com
independent CAN protocol controllers. The transceivers provide
differential transmit capability to the bus and differential receive
capability to the CAN controllers.
                                                                                                             MARKING
   It is consisted of two fully independent NCV7344 transceivers. The                                        DIAGRAM
NCV7446 guarantees additional timing parameters to ensure robust
communication at data rates beyond 1 Mbps to cope with CAN
flexible data rate requirements (CAN FD). These features make the                                               NV74
NCV7446 an excellent choice for all types of HS−CAN networks, in                        1                       46−0
