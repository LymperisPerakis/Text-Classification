8. Functional description
                       The PCA82C251 is the interface between a CAN protocol controller and the physical bus.
                       It is primarily intended for applications up to 1 MBd in trucks and buses. The device
                       provides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential receive capability to the
                       CAN controller. It is fully compatible with the “ISO 11898-24 V” standard.
                       A current-limiting circuit protects the transmitter output stage against short-circuits to
                       positive and negative battery voltage. Although power dissipation will increase as a result
                       of a short circuit fault condition, this feature will prevent destruction of the transmitter
                       output stage.
                       If the junction temperature exceeds approximately 160 C, the limiting current of both
                       transmitter outputs is decreased. Because the transmitter is responsible for most of the
                       power dissipated, this will result in reduced power dissipation and hence a lower chip
                       temperature. All other parts of the IC will remain operational. The thermal protection is
                       needed, in particular, when a bus line is short-circuited.
                       The CANH and CANL lines are also protected against electrical transients which may
                       occur in an automotive environment.
                       Pin 8 (Rs) allows three different modes of operation to be selected: High-speed, Slope
                       control and Standby.
                       For high-speed operation, the transmitter output transistors are simply switched on and off
                       as fast as possible. In this mode, no measures are taken to limit the rise and fall slopes. A
                       shielded cable is recommended to avoid RFI problems. High-speed mode is selected by
                       connecting pin 8 to ground.
                       Slope control mode allows the use of an unshielded twisted pair or a parallel pair of wires
                       as bus lines. To reduce RFI, the rise and fall slopes should be limited. The rise and fall
                       slopes can be programmed with a resistor connected from pin 8 to ground. The slope is
                       proportional to the current output at pin 8.
                       If a HIGH level is applied to pin 8, the circuit enters a low-current Standby mode. In this
                       mode, the transmitter is switched off and the receiver is switched to a low current. If
                       dominant bits are detected (differential bus voltage >0.9 V), RXD will be switched to a

                              back to normal operation (via pin 8). Because the receiver is slower in Standby mode, the
                              first message will be lost at higher bit rates.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.
