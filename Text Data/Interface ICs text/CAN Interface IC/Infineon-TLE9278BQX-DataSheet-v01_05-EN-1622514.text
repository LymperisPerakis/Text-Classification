Description
Infineon’s TLE9278BQX offers the highest level of integration at smallest footprint for automotive applications
requiring multiple channels of CAN transceivers like gateways and high-end Body Control Modules (BCM). A
high-efficient Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) buck regulator provides an external 5.0 V output voltage at
up to 750 mA while an additional DC/DC boost converter supports applications or conditions at low supply
input voltages. The device is controlled and monitored via a 16-bit Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Additional
features include a time-out/window watchdog circuit with reset, fail output and undervoltage reset. The
device offers low-power modes in order to support applications that are connected permanently to the
battery. A wake-up from the low-power mode is possible via a message on the buses, via the bi-level sensitive
monitoring/wake-up input as well as via the timer. The TLE9278BQX is offered in a very small footprint,
exposed pad PG-VQFN-48 (7 × 7 mm) power package.

1) The exposed die pad at the bottom of the package allows better power dissipation of heat from the SBC via the PCB.
    The exposed die pad is not connected to any active part of the IC and can be left floating or it can be connected to
    GND (recommended) for the best EMC performance.
Note:        All VS pins must be connected to battery potential or insert a reverse polarity diodes where required;
             All GND pins as well as the Cooling Tab must be connected to one common GND potential.

It must be ensured that the correct configurations are also selected, i.e. in case functions are not used that
they are disabled via SPI:
•   CANHx, CANLx, TXDCANx, RXDCANx: leave pins open.
•   BSTD: connect to GND.
•   WK: connect to GND and disable WK input via SPI.
•   RSTN / INTN: leave open.
•   FO/TEST: connect to GND during power-up to activate SBC Development Mode; connect to VS or leave
    open for normal user mode operation.
•   VBSENSE: connect to VS in case that Fast Battery Voltage Monitoring and Boost deactivation features are
    not used and keep them disabled.
•   VEXT: See Chapter 7.5.
•   n.c.: leave open.
•   Unused pins routed to an external connector which leaves the ECU should feature a zero ohm jumper
    (depopulated if unused) or ESD protection.

Notes
1. Stresses above the ones listed here may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to absolute
    maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
2. Integrated protection functions are designed to prevent IC destruction under fault conditions described in the
    data sheet. Fault conditions are considered as “outside” normal operating range. Protection functions are
    not designed for continuous repetitive operation.

Note:          Within the functional range the IC operates as described in the circuit description. The electrical
               characteristics are specified within the conditions given in the related electrical characteristics
               table.
Device Behavior Outside of Specified Functional Range:
•   28 V < VS,func < 40 V: Device will still be functional; the specified electrical characteristics might not be
    ensured anymore. The absolute maximum ratings are not violated. However, a thermal shutdown might
    occur due to high power dissipation.
•   VCAN < 4.75 V: The undervoltage bit VCAN_UV will be set in the SPI register BUS_STAT_0 and the transmitter
    will be disabled as long as the UV condition is present.
•   5.25 V < VCAN < 5.5 V: CANx transceiver still functional. However, the communication might fail due to out-
    of-spec operation.
•   VPOR,f < VS < 5.5 V: Device will be still functional; the specified electrical characteristics might not be ensured
    anymore:
    – The voltage regulators will enter the low-drop operation mode.
    – VIO_UV reset could be triggered depending on the VRTx settings.

Multi-CAN Power+ System Basis Chip
System Features
5              System Features
This chapter describes the system features and behavior of the TLE9278BQX:
•   State machine and SBC mode control.
•   Device configurations.
•   State of supply and peripherals.
•   Wake features.
•   Supervision and diagnosis functions.
The System Basis Chip is controlled via a 16-bit SPI interface. A detailed description can be found in
Chapter 13. The configuration as well as the diagnosis is handled via the SPI. The SPI mapping of the
TLE9278BQX is compatible to other devices of TLE926x and TLE927x family.
The System Basis Chip (SBC) offers six operating modes:
•   SBC Init Mode: power-up of the device and after soft reset.
•   SBC Normal Mode: the main operating mode of the device.
•   SBC Stop Mode: the first-level power saving mode with the main voltage regulator enabled.
•   SBC Sleep Mode: the second-level power saving mode with Buck regulator disable.
•   SBC Restart Mode: an intermediate mode after a wake event from SBC Sleep or SBC Fail-Safe Mode or after
    a failure (e.g. WD failure in config 1/3) to bring the microcontroller into a defined state via a reset. Once the
    failure condition is not present anymore, the device will automatically change to SBC Normal Mode after a
    delay time (tRD1).
•   SBC Fail-Safe Mode: a safe-state mode after critical failures (e.g. TSD2 thermal shutdown) to bring the
    system into a safe state and to ensure a proper restart of the system. Buck regulator is disabled.
A special mode called SBC Development Mode is available during software development or debugging of the
system. All of the operating modes mentioned above can be accessed in this mode. However, the watchdog
counter is stopped and does not need to be triggered. This mode can be accessed by setting the TEST pin to
GND during SBC Init Mode.
5.1            State Machine Description and SBC Mode Control
The different SBC Modes are selected via SPI by setting the respective SBC MODE bits in the register
M_S_CTRL.
The SBC MODE bits are cleared when going trough SBC Restart Mode, so the current SBC mode is always
shown.
Figure 3Figure 4 shows the SBC State Diagram.

Multi-CAN Power+ System Basis Chip
System Features
5.1.1        Device Configuration and SBC Init Mode
The SBC Init Mode is the mode where the hardware configuration of the SBC is stored and where the
microcontroller finishes the initialization phase.
The SBC starts up in SBC Init Mode after crossing the power-on reset VPOR,r threshold (see also Chapter 12.3)
and the watchdog will start with a long open window (tLW typical 200ms) after the RSTN is released.
During this power-on phase following configurations are stored in the device:
•   Supply and Power up configurability.
•   The device behavior regarding a watchdog trigger failure and a VIO overvoltage condition is determined by
    the external circuitry on the INTN pin (see below).
•   The selection of the normal device operation or the SBC Development Mode (watchdog disabled for
    debugging purposes) will be set depending on the voltage level of the FO/TEST pin (see also
    Chapter 5.1.7).
5.1.1.1      Supply and Power up configurability
The TLE9278BQX has the possibility to define the level of the digital IO’s using a dedicated pin (VIO). A separate
pin (PCFG) is available to store the I/O supply voltage configuration during power-up. The respective
configuration will be stored for all conditions and can only be changed by powering down the device (VS <
VPOR,f).
Depending of the configuration, the supervision functions can refer to VCC1 or VEXT.
The Table 5 shows the only allowed combinations and related behavior.

Note:        VIO can be connected only to VCC1 or VEXT.
5.1.1.2      Watchdog trigger failure configuration
There are four different device configurations (Table 6) available defining the watchdog failure and the VIO
overvoltage behavior. The configurations can be selected via the external connection on the INTN pin and the
SPI bit CFG2 in the HW_CTRL_0 register (see also Chapter 13.4):
•   A watchdog trigger failures leads to SBC Restart Mode (Config 1/3) and depending on CFG2 the Fail Output
    (FO) are activated after the 1st or 2nd watchdog trigger failure;

    If VIO_OV_RST is set and in Config 1/3, then SBC Restart Mode will be entered in case of VIO_OV and the
    FO is activated.
•   A watchdog trigger failures leads to SBC Fail-Safe Mode (Config 2/4) and depending on CFG2 the Fail
    Output (FO) are activated after the 1st or 2nd watchdog trigger failure. The first watchdog trigger failure in
    Config 4 will lead to SBC Restart Mode;
    If VIO_OV_RST is set and in Config 2/4, then SBC Fail-Safe Mode will be entered in case of VIO_OV and the
    FO is activated.
The respective device configuration can be identified by reading the SPI bits CFG2_STATE and CFG1_STATE

In case of 3 consecutive resets due to WD fail, it is possible in Config 1 and 3 not to generate additional reset
by setting the MAX_3_RST on WD_CTRL.
Figure 5 shows the timing diagram of the hardware configuration selection. The hardware configuration is
defined during SBC Init Mode. The INTN pin is internally pulled LOW with a weak pull-down resistor during the
reset delay time tRD1, i.e. after VIO crosses the reset threshold VRT1 and before the RSTN pin goes HIGH. The
INTN pin is monitored during this time and the configuration (depending on the voltage level at INTN) is read
and stored at the rising edge of RSTN (with a filter time of tCFG_F).

Note:            If the POR bit is not cleared then the internal pull-down resistor will be reactivated every time RSTN
                 is pulled LOW the configuration will be updated at the rising edge of RSTN. Therefore it is
                 recommended to clear the POR bit right after initialization.
5.1.1.3          SBC Init Mode
In SBC Init Mode, the device waits for the microcontroller to finish its startup and initialization sequence. In
the SBC Init Mode any SPI command will bring the SBC to SBC Normal Mode. During the long open window
the watchdog has to be triggered. Thereby the watchdog will be automatically configured. A missing
watchdog trigger during the long open window will cause a watchdog failure and the device will enter SBC
Restart Mode.
Wake events are ignored during SBC Init Mode and will therefore be lost.
Note:             Any SPI command will bring the SBC to SBC Normal Mode even if non-valid (see Chapter 13.2).
Note:            For a safe start-up, it is recommended to use the first SPI command to trigger and to configure the
                 watchdog (see Chapter 12.2).

System Features
Note:         At power up, no VIO_UV will be issued nor will FO be triggered as long as VIO is below the VRT1
              threshold and VS is below the VIO short circuit detection threshold VS,UV. The RSTN pin will be kept
              low as long as VIO is below the selected VRT1 threshold. As soon as the VIO is higher than VRT1, the
              RSTN is released after tRD1.
5.1.2         SBC Normal Mode
The SBC Normal Mode is the standard operating Mode for the SBC. All configurations have to be done in SBC
Normal Mode before entering a low-power mode (see also Chapter 5.1.6 for the device configuration defining
the Fail-Safe Mode behavior). A wake-up event on CANx and WK will create an interrupt on pin INTN however,
no change of SBC Mode will occur. The configuration options are listed below:
•   VCC1 is active, Buck in PWM Mode.
•   VEXT can be switched ON or OFF in accordance with Table 5.
•   CANx is configurable (OFF coming from SBC Init Mode; OFF or wake capable coming from SBC Restart
    Mode, see also Chapter 5.1.5).
•   Wake pin level can be monitored and can be selected to be wake capable.
•   Cyclic wake period can be configured using TIMER_CTRL_0 and enabled by setting TIMER1_WK_ EN.
•   Watchdog is configurable.
•   FO is OFF by default.
In SBC Normal Mode, there is the possibility of testing the FO output, i.e. to verify if setting the FO pin to low
will create the intended behavior within the system. The FO output can be enabled and then disabled again
by the microcontroller by setting the FO_ON SPI bit. This feature is only intended for testing purposes.
5.1.3         SBC Stop Mode
The SBC Stop Mode is the first level technique to reduce the overall current consumption. All kind of settings
have to be done before entering SBC Stop Mode. In SBC Stop Mode any kind of SPI write commands are
ignored and the SPI_FAIL bit is set, except for changing to SBC Normal Mode, triggering a SBC Soft Reset,
refreshing the watchdog, changing modulation of the buck. The configuration options are listed below:
•   VCC1 is ON, Buck in PFM Mode if IVCC1 < IPFM-PWM,TH.
•   VEXT is fixed ON or OFF in accordance with Table 5 and SPI configuration.
•   CANx can be selected for ‘Receive Only Mode’, to be wake capable or OFF.
•   WK pin can be selected to be wake capable, PWM_BY_WK (switch PFM/PWM buck modulation) or OFF.
•   Wake capability via cyclic wake can be selected.
•   Watchdog is fixed or OFF (if WD disable sequence was executed).
A wake-up event on CANx and WK will create an interrupt on pin INTN however, no change of SBC Mode will
occur.
In SBC Stop Mode, it is allowed to use the Boost module (enabled before to enter in SBC Stop Mode) in case of
the VS is dropping. The Boost works only in PWM and therefore the total amount of current consumption will
increase.
Note:         It is not possible to switch directly from SBC Stop Mode to SBC Sleep Mode. Doing so will also set the
              SPI_FAIL flag and will bring the SBC into Normal Mode via SBC Restart Mode.

5.1.4          SBC Sleep Mode
The SBC Sleep Mode is the second level technique to reduce the overall current consumption to a minimum
needed to react on wake-up events.
All settings must be done before entering SBC Sleep Mode. In case that SPI configurations in Sleep Mode have
been sent to the SBC, the commands are ignored and no reactions from the SBC.
The configuration options are listed below:
•    VCC1 is OFF.
•    VEXT is fixed ON or OFF in accordance with Table 5 and SPI configuration.
•    CANx can be selected to be wake capable or OFF.
•    WK pin can be selected to be wake capable or OFF.
A wake-up event on CANx or WK pin will bring the device via SBC Restart Mode into SBC Normal Mode again
and signal the wake event and corresponding sources.
It is not possible to switch off all wake sources in Sleep Mode. This will lead to SBC Normal Mode via SBC
Restart Mode instead.
In order to enter SBC Sleep Mode successfully, all wake source signalization flags from WK_STAT_0 and
WK_STAT_2 need to be cleared. If a failure to do so, will result in an immediate wake-up from SBC Sleep Mode
by going via SBC Restart to Normal Mode.
Note:          As soon as the Sleep Command is sent, the Reset will go low to avoid any undefined behavior
               between SBC and microcontroller.
5.1.5          SBC Restart Mode
There are multiple reasons to enter the SBC Restart Mode. The purpose of the SBC Restart Mode is to reset the
microcontroller:
•    From SBC Normal and Stop Mode, it is reached in case of undervoltage on VIO. In case of 4 consecutive
     VIO_UV events, SBC Fail-Safe Mode is entered.
•    From SBC Normal and Stop Mode it is reached in case of overvoltage on VIO in config 1/3 if VIO_OV_RST is
     set.
•    Incorrect Watchdog triggering (depending of the configuration).
•    From SBC Sleep and Fail-Safe Mode to ramp up VIO supply after wake event.
From SBC Restart Mode, the SBC goes automatically to SBC Normal Mode, i.e the mode is left automatically
by the SBC without any microcontroller influence once the VIO_UV condition is not present anymore and
when the reset delay time (tRD1) has expired. The Reset Output (RSTN) is released at the transition.
Entering or leaving the SBC Restart Mode will not result in deactivation of the Fail output.
The following functions are not changed in SBC Restart mode:
•    VEXT is fixed ON or OFF in accordance with Table 5 and SPI configuration.
•    VCC1 is ON or ramping up.
•    BOOST is fixed or OFF.
Table 8 contains detailed descriptions of the reason to restart:

5.1.6          SBC Fail-Safe Mode
The purpose of this mode is to bring the system in a safe status after a failure condition by turning off the VCC1
and VEXT supply and the FO pin is automatically activated. After a wake-up event the system is then able to
restart again.
The Fail-Safe Mode is automatically reached in case of:
•   Overtemperature condition (TSD2).
•   After 1 or 2 watchdog fails (depending on config setting).
•   At the 4th consecutive VIO undervoltage event.
•   From SBC Normal and Stop Mode, in case of overvoltage on VIO in config 2/4, if VIO_OV_RST is set.
•   VIO is shorted to GND.
•   VIO is below the VRTx for time longer than tVIO,SC.
In this case, the default wake sources are activated, the wake-up events are cleared in the register WK_STAT_0
and WK_STAT_2.
The mode will be maintained for at least tTSD2 in case of TSD2 event and tFS,min in case of other failure events
to avoid any fast toggling behavior. All wake sources will be masked during this time but the wake-up events
will be stored. Stored wake-up events and wake-up event after this minimum waiting time, will lead to SBC
Restart Mode. Leaving the SBC Fail-Safe Mode will not result in deactivation of the Fail Output pin.
The following functions are influenced during SBC Fail-Safe Mode:
•   FO output is activated.
•   VCC1 is OFF.
•   VEXT is OFF.
•   CANx is wake capable.
•   WK is wake capable (in case that PWM_BY_WK was set, moving to SBC Fail-Safe Mode will clear the bit).
•   Cyclic wake is disabled.

5.1.7         SBC Development Mode
The SBC Development Mode is used during development phase of the application, especially for software
development.
Compared to the default SBC user mode operation, this mode is a super set of the state machine. The device
will start also in SBC Init Mode and it is possible to use all the SBC Modes and functions with following
differences:
•   Watchdog is stopped and does not need to be triggered. Therefore no reset is triggered due to watchdog
    failure.
•   SBC Fail-Safe and Restart Mode are not reached due to watchdog failure but the other reasons to enter
    these modes are still valid.
•   CANx default value in SBC INIT MODE is ON instead of OFF.
The mode is reached by setting the FO/TEST pin to LOW for the entire SBC INIT Mode and by sending an
arbitrary SPI command. The SBC Init Mode is reachable after the power-up or sending a software reset.
SBC Development Mode can only be left by a power-down or by providing a SBC Software Reset using the
MODE bits on M_S_CTRL register regardless the FO/TEST pin level.
When the FO/TEST pin is left open, or connected to VS during the start-up, the SBC starts into normal
operation. The FO/TEST pin has an integrated pull-up resistor (switched ON only during SBC Init Mode) to
prevent the SBC device from starting in SBC Development Mode during normal life of the vehicle. To avoid any
disturbances, the FO/TEST pin is monitored during the SBC Init Mode when the RSTN is HIGH until SBC Init
Mode is left. Only if the FO/TEST pin is LOW for the Init Mode time when the RSTN is HIGH, SBC Development
Mode is reached and stored.

5.2          Wake Features
Following wake sources are implemented in the device:
•   Static Sense: WK input is permanently active (see Chapter 9).
•   Cyclic Wake: internal wake source controlled via internal timer (see Chapter 5.2.1).
•   CANx wake: wake-up via CAN message (see Chapter 8).
The wake source must be set before entering in SBC Sleep Mode. In case of critical situation, when the device
will be set into SBC Fail-Safe mode, all default wake sources will be activated. For additional information
about setting, refer to the respective chapters.
5.2.1        Cyclic Wake
The cyclic wake feature is intended to reduce the quiescent current of the device and application.
When the cyclic wake is enabled, a periodic INTN is generated in SBC Normal and Stop Mode based on the
setting of TIMER_CTRL_0.
The correct sequence to configure the cyclic wake is shown in Figure 6. The sequence is as follows:
•   Disable the cyclic wake feature to ensure that there is not unintentional interrupt when activating cyclic
    wake (TIMER1_WK_ EN = 0).
•   Configure the cyclic wake timer period in TIMER_CTRL_0 register.
•   Enable the cyclic wake as a wake-up source in the register WK_CTRL_0 (TIMER1_WK_ EN = 1).

6.1                Block Description
The SMPS module in the TLE9278BQX is implemented as a cascade of a step-up regulator followed by a step-
down post-regulator. The step-up regulator (DC/DC Boost converter) provides a VS level which permits the
step-down post-regulator (DC/DC Buck converter) to regulate without entering a low-drop condition.
The SMPS module is active in SBC Normal, Stop and Restart Mode. In SBC Sleep and Fail-Safe Mode, the SMPS
module is disabled.

Figure 8        Buck Block Diagram
The DC/DC Buck converter is intended as post-regulator (VCC1) and it provides a step down converter function
transferring energy from VS to a lower output voltage with high efficiency (typically more than 80%). The
output voltage is 5 V in a current range up to 750 mA. It is regulated via a digital loop with a precision of ±2%.
It requires an external inductor and capacitor filter on the output switching pin (BCKSW). The Buck regulator
has integrated high-side and low-side power switching transistors. The compensation of the regulation loop
is done internally and no additional external components are needed.
A typical application example and external components proposal is available in Chapter 14.1.
The Buck converter is active in SBC Normal, Stop and Restart Mode and it is disabled in SBC Sleep and Fail-
Safe Mode.
Depending on the SBC Mode, the Buck converter works in two different modes:
•    PWM Mode (Pulse Width Modulation): This mode is available in SBC Normal Mode, SBC Restart Mode and
     SBC Stop Mode (only for automatic or manual PFM to PWM transitions. Refer to Chapter 6.2.2). In PWM,
     the Buck converter operates with a fixed switching frequency (fBUK). The duty cycle is calculated internally
     based on input voltage, output voltage and output current. The precision is ±2% or ±3% based on input
     supply and output current range (refer to Figure 13 for more information). In PWM Mode, the Buck
     converter is capable of a 100% duty cycle in case of low VS conditions. In order to reduce EMC, the edge
     shaping feature has been implemented to control the activation and deactivation of the two power
     switches.

•   PFM Mode (Pulse Frequency Modulation): This mode is activated automatically when the SBC Stop Mode
    is entered. The PFM Mode is an asynchronous mode. PFM Mode does not have a controller switching
    frequency. The switching frequency depends on conditions of the Buck regulator such as the following:
    input supply voltage, output voltage, output current and external components. A typical timing diagram is
    shown in Figure 9. The Buck converter in PFM Mode has a tolerance of ±4%. The transition from PFM mode
    to PWM mode is described in Chapter 6.2.2.

6.1.1.1        Startup Procedure (Soft Start)
The Startup Procedure (Soft Start) permits to achieve the Buck regulator output voltage avoiding large
overshoot on the output voltage. This feature is activated during the power-up, from SBC Sleep to Restart
Mode and from SBC Fail-Safe to SBC Restart Mode.
When the Buck regulator is activated, it starts in open loop with a minimum duty cycle which is maintained for
a limited number of switching periods. After this first phase, the duty cycle is linearly increased by a fixed step
and it is maintained for a limited number of switching periods for each duty cycle step. This procedure is
repeated until the target output voltage value of the Buck regulator is reached. As soon as the Buck regulator
output voltage is reached, the regulation loop is closed and it starts to operate normally using PWM Mode
adjusting the duty cycle according to the Buck input and output voltages and the output current.
6.1.1.2        Buck regulator Status register
The register SMPS_STAT contains information about the open or short conditions on BCKSW pin. No SBC
Mode or configuration changes are triggered if one bit on SMPS_STAT register is set.
6.1.1.3        External components
The Buck converter needs one inductor and output capacitor filter. The inductor has a fixed value of 47 µH.
Secondary parameters such as saturation current must be selected based on the maximum current capability
needed in the application.
The output filter capacitors are two parallel 22 µF ceramic capacitor. For additional information, refer to
Chapter 14.1.

The regulator integrates the power switching and the sense resistor for overcurrent detection.
The Boost regulator can be enabled in SBC Normal Mode via SPI (register HW_CTRL_0, bit BOOST_EN) and
four output voltage values are selectable via BOOST_V. The Boost regulator can also be active in SBC Stop and
Restart Mode. The selected boost output voltage will automatically define the voltage thresholds where the
boost will be ON (VBST,TH1, VBST,TH2, VBST,TH3 and VBST,TH4). If the Boost regulator is enabled, it switches ON
automatically when VS falls below the selected threshold voltage and switches OFF when crossing this
threshold including hysteresis again. The bit BST_ACT on SMPS_STAT register indicates that the Boost has
been activated.
The Boost output voltage can be changed only if BOOST_EN is set to 0. In case that the boost output voltage
configuration changes with BOOST_EN set to 1, the SPI_FAIL bit is set and the command is ignored.
Figure 11 shows the typical timing for enabling the Boost converter.

The Boost regulator works in PWM Mode with fixed frequency (fBST) and a tolerance of ±3%.
If the Boost is enabled in Stop Mode, the quiescent current in the SBC is increased (P_4.4.31).
6.1.2.1       Boost Regulator Status register
The register SMPS_STAT contains information about the open or short conditions on Boost pins including loss
of GND detection. No SBC mode or configuration is triggered if one bit is set on the SMPS_STAT register.
6.1.2.2       External Components
The Boost converter requires a number of external components such as the following: input buffer capacitor
on the battery voltage, inductor, freewheeling diode and filter capacitors.
For recommend external components and corresponding values, refer to Chapter 14.1.

6.2          Power Scenarios
The chapter describes the features and performance of the Buck regulator according to SBC modes. The Boost
module works only in SBC Normal or Stop Mode using PWM modulation (refer also to Chapter 6.1.2).
6.2.1        Buck behavior in SBC Normal Mode
In SBC Normal Mode the Buck works is in PWM mode with fixed switching frequency. All supervision functions
for Buck converter are available in SBC Normal Mode and available depending the device configuration
(Chapter 5.1.1). For additional details on the supervision functions, refer to Chapter 12.7, Chapter 12.8,
Chapter 12.9 and Chapter 12.11.
6.2.2        Buck behavior in SBC Stop Mode
The SBC Stop Mode operation is intended to reduce the total amount of quiescent current while still providing
output voltage. In order to achieve this, the Buck regulator changes the modulation from PWM (Pulse Width
Modulation) to PFM (Pulse Frequency Modulation) when entering SBC Stop Mode.
In SBC Stop Mode, the Buck modulation can change as follow:
•    Buck module always in PFM modulation (default setting).
•    Automatically change from PFM to PWM (setting PWM_AUTO).
•    Modulation is controlled by the WK pin (setting PWM_BY_WK).
If the PWM_BY_WK and PWM_AUTO are set at the same time, the PWM_AUTO has highest priority and PWM
automatic transition will be used.
If PWM_BY_WK and PWM_AUTO are at the same time set to 0, the buck module remains in PFM in SBC Stop
Mode.
If in SBC Stop Mode the Buck modulation is PWM, the buck output voltage tolerance and output current
capability are like SBC Normal Mode (P_6.5.1 and P_6.5.45).
6.2.2.1      Automatic Transition from PFM to PWM in SBC Stop Mode
If more current is needed, an automatic transition from PFM to PWM mode is implemented. When the Buck
regulator output current exceeds the IPFM-PWM,TH threshold, the Buck module changes the modulation to PWM
and an INTN event is generated. In addition, the PFM_PWM bit on WK_STAT_0 is set.
In order to set the Buck modulation again in PFM mode, a SBC Stop Mode command has to be write to
M_S_CTRL register. This command has to be sent when the required Buck output current is below the IPFM-
PWM,TH threshold.
By default, the feature is disable. To enable the automatic transition from PFM to PWM, the PWM_AUTO bit in
HW_CTRL_0 has to be set before entering SBC Stop Mode.
When entering SBC Stop Mode, the automatic transition from PFM to PWM mode is activated after the
transition time (tlag), during which the Buck regulator loop changes the modulation technique. Figure 12
shows the timing transition from SBC Normal to Stop Mode.
The transition time tlag is always implemented in case of transition from PWM to PFM modulation.

Figure 12     Transition from SBC Normal to SBC Stop Mode
The tlag can be configured via SPI using the PWM_TLAG in HW_CTRL_0 register.
The automatic transition from PFM to PWM can be disabled by setting the PWM_AUTO to 0 in the HW_CTRL_0
register.
6.2.2.2       Manual Transition from PFM to PWM in SBC Stop Mode
The PFM to PWM transition can also be controlled by the microcontroller or an external signal by using the WK
pin as a trigger signal in SBC Stop Mode.
When the PWM_BY_WK bit is set to 1, the Buck regulator can be switched from PFM to PWM using the WK pin.
A LOW level at the WK pin will switch the Buck converter to PFM mode, a HIGH level will switch the Buck
converter to PWM Mode. In this configuration, the transition time tlag is not taken into account because a
defined signal from microcontroller or external source is expected.
6.2.2.3       SBC Stop to Normal Mode transition
The microcontroller sends an SPI command to switch from SBC Stop Mode to SBC Normal Mode. In this
transition, the Buck regulator changes the modulation from PFM to PWM.
Once the SPI command for the SBC Normal Mode transition is received, the Buck output current is able to rise
above the specified maximum Stop Mode current (IPFM-PWM,TH).
If the transition from SBC Stop Mode to SBC Normal Mode is carried out when the Boost is enabled and
operating, it will continue to operate without any changes.
6.2.3         Buck behavior in SBC Sleep or Fail Safe Mode
In SBC Sleep or Fail Safe Mode, the Buck and Boost converter are off and not operating. The lowest quiescent
current is achievable.
6.2.3.1       SBC Sleep/Fail Safe Mode to SBC Normal Mode transition
In case of a wake-up event from WK pin or transceivers, the SBC will be set to SBC Restart Mode and as soon
as the reset is released, into SBC Normal Mode.
In SBC Restart Mode, the Buck regulator is activated and ramping-up. The Boost regulator is activated and
ramping-up again (in case the VS is below the selected threshold) in according the configuration selected in
SBC Normal Mode. As soon as the Buck output voltage exceeds the reset threshold, the RSTN pin is released.

External Voltage Regulator
7.2          General Description
The external voltage regulator can be used as an independent voltage regulator or as microcontroller supply
with fixed VEXT output voltage (depending on the PCFG pin setting). For additional information, refer to
Chapter 5.1.1.1, in particular the Table 5.
The regulator will act in the respective SBC Mode as described in Table 11.
The maximum current IEXT_max is defined by the shunt used. To protect the VEXT against overtemperature
condition, the base driver has a dedicate temperature sensor. For detailed temperature protection features,
refer to Chapter 12.11.
The status of VEXT is reported in the SUP_STAT_1 register (for detailed protection features refer to
Chapter 12.10).

                         (PCFG = Open)                               (PCFG = GND)
INIT Mode                OFF                                         ON, VEXT = 3.3 V
Normal Mode              Configurable                                VEXT = 3.3 V (fixed)
Stop Mode                Fixed                                       VEXT = 3.3 V (fixed)
Sleep Mode               Fixed                                       OFF
Restart Mode             Fixed                                       VEXT = 3.3 V (fixed)
Fail-Safe Mode           OFF                                         OFF
Note:        The configuration of the VEXT voltage regulator behavior must be implemented immediately when
             the SBC Normal Mode is reached after power-up of the device. As soon as the bit VEXT_ON is set for
             the first time, the configuration for VEXT cannot be changed anymore. The configuration cannot be
             changed as long as the device is supplied.
Note:        If the VEXT output voltage is supplying external off-board loads, the application must consider the
             series resonance circuit built by cable inductance and decoupling capacitor at load. Sufficient
             damping must be provided(e.g. series resistor with capacitor directly at device or 100 Ω Resistor
             between PNP collector and VEXTREF with 10 µF cap on collector (see Figure 16).
7.2.1        Functional Description
This regulator offers with VEXT a second supply which could be used as off-board supply e.g. for sensors due
to the integrated HV pins VEXTB, VEXTSH, VEXTREF.

Figure 16    VEXT Hardware Setup
VEXT can be switched ON or OFF but the output voltage configuration cannot no longer be changed once
activated.
An overcurrent detection function is realized with the external shunt (see Chapter 7.4 for calculating the
desired shunt value) and output current shunt voltage threshold (Vshunt_threshold). When this threshold is
reached, IEXT is limited and only the overcurrent detection bit VEXT_OC is set (no other reactions). This bit can
be cleared via SPI once the overcurrent condition is no longer present. If the overcurrent detection feature is
not needed, connect the VEXTSH pin to VEXT supply (VEXTIN pin).
If PCFG pin is left open, VEXT has the undervoltage signaling enabled and an undervoltage event is signaled
with the bit VREG_UV in the SUP_STAT_0. If PCFG is connected to GND, the VEXT undervoltage is signaled
with the bit VIO_UV on SUP_STAT_1 register (refer to Chapter 12.7 for additional information).
7.3          External Components
The characterization is done with the BCP52-16 from Infineon (IEXT < 200 mA) and with MJD253 from ON
Semi.Other PNP transistors can be used. The functionality must be checked in the application.
Figure 16 shows the hardware set up used.

Note:        The SBC is not able to ensure a thermal protection of the external PNP transistor. The power
             handling capabilities for the application must therefore be chosen according to the selected PNP
             device and according to the PCB layout and the properties of the application to prevent thermal
             damage.

7.4            Calculation of RSHUNT
The maximum current IEXT_max where the overcurrent detection bit is set (VEXT_OC = 1 on the SUP_STAT_1
register), is determined by the shunt resistor RSHUNT and the Output Current Shunt Voltage Threshold
(Vshunt_threshold).
The resistor can be calculated as following:
                    Vshunt _ threshold
     RSHUNT =                                                                                       (7.1)
                       I EXT _ max
7.5            Unused Pins
In case the VEXT is not used in the application, connect the unused pins of VEXT as followed:
•   Connect VEXTSH, VEXTIN to VS or leave open.
•   Leave VEXTB open.
•   Leave VEXTREF open.
•   Keep VEXT disabled.

8.2           Functional Description
The Controller Area Network (CAN) transceiver part of the SBC provides high-speed (HS) differential mode
data transmission (up to 5 Mb) and reception in automotive and industrial applications. It works as an
interface between the CAN protocol controller and the physical bus lines compatible with ISO 11898-2, 11898-
5 as well as SAE J2284.
The CAN transceiver offers low power modes to reduce current consumption. This supports networks with
partially powered down nodes. To support software diagnostic functions, a CAN Receive-only Mode is
implemented.
It is designed to provide excellent passive behavior when the transceiver is switched off (mixed networks,
clamp15/30 applications).
A wake-up from the CAN wake capable mode is possible via a message on the bus. Thus, the microcontroller
can be powered down or idled and will be woken up by the CAN bus activities.
The CAN transceiver is designed to withstand the severe conditions of automotive applications and to support
12 V applications.
The different transceiver modes can be controlled via the SPI CANx bits.
Figure 18 shows the possible transceiver mode transitions when changing the SBC mode.

             will remain OFF.

CAN FD Support
CAN FD stands for ‘CAN with Flexible Data Rate’. It is based on the well established CAN protocol as specified
in ISO 11898-1. CAN FD still uses the CAN bus arbitration method. The benefit is that the bit rate can be
increased by switching to a shorter bit time at the end of the arbitration process and then returning to the
longer bit time at the CRC delimiter before the receivers transmit their acknowledge bits. See also Figure 19.
In addition, the effective data rate is increased by allowing longer data fields. CAN FD allows the transmission
of up to 64 data bytes compared to the 8 data bytes from the standard CAN.

CAN FD has to be supported by both the physical layer and the CAN controller. If the CAN controller cannot
support CAN FD, then the respective CAN node must at least tolerate CAN FD communication. This CAN FD
tolerant mode is implemented in the physical layer.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
8.2.1           CAN OFF Mode
The CAN OFF Mode is the default mode after power-up of the SBC. It is available in all SBC Modes and is
intended to completely stop CAN activities or when CAN communication is not needed. The CANH/L bus
interface acts as a high impedance input with a very small leakage current. In CAN OFF Mode, a wake-up event
on the bus will be ignored.
8.2.2           CAN Normal Mode
The CAN Transceiver is enabled via SPI in SBC Normal Mode. CAN Normal Mode is designed for normal data
transmission/reception within the HS-CAN network. The mode is only available in SBC Normal Mode or SBC
Init Mode if the SBC Development Mode is used. The bus biasing is set to VCAN/2.
Transmission
The signal from the microcontroller is applied to the TXDCANx input of the SBC. The bus driver switches the
CANH/L output stages to transfer this input signal to the CAN bus lines.
Enabling sequence
The CAN transceiver requires an enabling time tCAN,EN before a message can be sent on the bus. This means
that the TXDCANx signal can only be pulled LOW after the enabling time. If this is not ensured, then the
TXDCANx needs to be set back to HIGH (=recessive) until the enabling time is completed. Only the next
dominant bit will be transmitted on the bus. Figure 20 shows different scenarios and explanations for CAN
enabling.

Reduced Electromagnetic Emission
To reduce electromagnetic emissions (EME), the bus driver controls CANH/L slopes symmetrically.
The slope control can be disabled using the CAN_x_Flash bits to achieve bite rate higher than 5 Mb.
Reception
Analog CAN bus signals are converted into digital signals at RXDCANx via the differential input receiver.
8.2.3           CAN Receive Only Mode
In CAN Receive Only Mode (RXD only), the driver stage is de-activated but reception is still operational. This
mode is available in SBC Normal and Stop Mode. The bus biasing is set to VCAN/2.

8.2.4         CAN Wake Capable Mode
This mode can be used in SBC Stop, Sleep, Restart and Normal Mode and it is used to monitor bus activities. It
is automatically accessed in SBC Fail-Safe Mode. A valid wake-up pattern (WUP) on the bus results in a change
of behavior of the SBC, as described in Table 15. As a signalization to the microcontroller, the RXDCANx pin is
set LOW and will stay LOW until the CANx transceiver is changed to any other mode. After a wake-up event, the
transceiver can be switched to CAN Normal Mode for communication using SPI command.
As shown in Figure 21, a wake-up pattern is signaled on the bus by two consecutive dominant bus levels for
at least tWake1 (filter time t > tWake1), each separated by a recessive bus level of less than tWake2.

Rearming the Transceiver for Wake Capability
After a bus wake-up event, the transceiver is woken. However, the CANx transceiver mode bits will still show
wake capable (=‘01’) so that the RXDCAN signal will be pulled low. There are two possibilities how the CAN
transceiver’s wake capable mode is enabled again after a wake event:
•   The CAN transceiver mode must be toggled, i.e. switched from Wake Capable Mode to CAN Normal Mode,
    CAN Receive Only Mode or CAN Off, before switching to CAN Wake Capable Mode again.
•   Rearming is done automatically when the SBC is changed to SBC Stop, Sleep, or SBC Fail-Safe Mode to
    ensure wake-up capability.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
Note:        It is not necessary to clear the CAN wake-up bit CAN_x_WU to become wake capable again. It is
             sufficient to toggle the CAN mode.
Wake-Up in SBC Stop and Normal Mode
In SBC Stop Mode, if a wake-up is detected, it is always signaled by the INTN output and in the WK_STAT_0,
WK_STAT_2 SPI registers. It is also signaled by RXDCANx pulled to low. The same applies for the SBC Normal
Mode. The microcontroller should set the device from SBC Stop Mode to SBC Normal Mode; there is no
automatic transition to SBC Normal Mode.
For functional safety reasons, the watchdog will be automatically enabled in SBC Stop Mode after a bus wake
event in case it was disabled before (if bit WD_EN_WK_ BUS was configured to HIGH before).
Wake-Up in SBC Sleep Mode
Wake-up is possible via a CAN message (filter time t > tWake1). The wake-up automatically transfers the SBC into
the SBC Restart Mode and from there to Normal Mode the corresponding RXDCANx pin in set to LOW. The
microcontroller is able to detect the low signal on RXDCANx and to read the wake source out of the
WK_STAT_0 or WK_STAT_2 register via SPI. No interrupt is generated when coming out of SBC Sleep Mode.
The microcontroller can now for example switch the CAN transceiver into CAN Normal Mode via SPI to start
communication.

deactivates the transmission of the signal at the bus. This is implemented to prevent the bus from being
blocked permanently due to an error. The transmitter is disabled and the transceiver is switched to Receive
Only Mode. The failure is stored in the SPI flag CAN_x_FAIL. The CAN transmitter stage is activated again after
the dominant time-out condition is removed and the transceiver is automatically switched back to CAN
Normal Mode.The transceiver configuration stays unchanged.
8.2.6        Bus Dominant Clamping
If the HS-CAN bus signal is dominant for a time t > tBUS_CAN_TO, regardless of the CAN transceiver mode a bus
dominant clamping is detected and the SPI bit CAN_x_FAIL is set. The transceiver configuration stays
unchanged.
8.2.7        Undervoltage Detection
The voltage at the CAN supply pin is monitored in CAN Normal Mode and CAN Receiver Only Mode . In case of
VCAN undervoltage, the bit VCAN_UV is set and the SBC disables the transmitter stage. If the undervoltage
condition is not present anymore (VCAN > VCAN_UV,f), the transceiver is automatically switched back to CAN
Normal Mode. The transceiver configuration stays unchanged.

•   Wake-up capability for power saving modes.
•   Switch feature for DC/DC Mode (PFM/PWM) in SBC Stop Mode.
•   Sensitive for level changes LOW to HIGH and HIGH to LOW.

9.2          Functional Description
The SBC can wake up following a voltage level change at the wake input. The WK input pin is sensitive to level
changes. This means that both transitions, HIGH to LOW and LOW to HIGH, result in SBC signalling (see also
Figure 25). The signal is created in one of the following ways:
•   By triggering the interrupt in SBC Normal and SBC Stop Mode.
•   By waking up the device in SBC Sleep and SBC Fail-Safe Mode.

The wake-up capability, using WK pin, can be enabled or disabled via SPI command.
When the WK is enabled (WK_EN set to 1 on WK_CTRL_1 register), the device wakes up from Sleep Mode with
a HIGH to LOW or LOW to HIGH transition on the WK pin. In SBC Stop and Normal Mode, an Interrupt will be
generated after tFWK (filter time). In SBC Fail-Safe Mode, the WK is automatically selected as wake-up source
and the device will always go to SBC Restart Mode with a HIGH to LOW or LOW to HIGH transition. The wake
source for WK pin can be read in the register WK_STAT_0 at the bit WK_WU.The state of the WK pin (LOW or
HIGH) can always be read in SBC Normal and Stop Mode at the bit WK on register WK_LVL_STAT.
The WK pin can also be configured as a selection pin for PFM / PWM mode in SBC Stop Mode using the bit
PWM_BY_WK of register HW_CTRL_0. In this case a LOW level at the WK pin will switch the Buck converter to
PFM mode, a HIGH level will switch the Buck converter to PWM Mode maintaining the SBC in SBC Stop Mode.
The filter time is not taken into account because a defined signal is expected (refer to Chapter 6.2.2.2).
In case that the PWM_BY_WK is used, it is still possible to use the WK pin to wake-up from SBC Sleep Mode to
SBC Normal Mode.

Figure 28      Interrupt Block Diagram
The interrupt is used to signal wake-up events in real time to the microcontroller. The interrupt block is
designed as a push/pull output stage as shown in Figure 28. An interrupt is triggered and the INTN pin is pulled
low (active low) for tINTN in SBC Normal and Stop Mode and it is released again once tINTN is expired. The
minimum HIGH-time of INTN between two consecutive interrupts is tINTD. An interrupt does not automatically
cause a SBC mode change.
The following wake-up events will be signalized via INTN:
•   All wake-up events stored in the wake status SPI register WK_STAT_0 and WK_STAT_2.
•   If the bit CANTO_x is set and if it was not masked out.
•   The VBAT (at pin VBSENSE) monitoring threshold is triggered.
•   An interrupt is only triggered if the respective function is also enabled as a wake source.
•   Automatic transition from PFM to PWM mode in SBC Stop Mode.
The register WK_LVL_STAT is not generating interrupt events.
In addition to this behavior, an INTN will be triggered when the SBC is sent to SBC Stop Mode and not all bits
were cleared in the WK_STAT_0 and WK_STAT_2registers.
The SPI status registers are updated at every falling edge of the INTN pulse. All interrupt events are stored in
the respective register (except the register WK_LVL_STAT) until the register is read and cleared via an SPI
command. The interrupt behavior is shown in Figure 29.

The Fail Output consists of a failure logic block and one LOW-side switch. In case of a failure, the FO output is
activated and the SPI bit FO_ON_STATE, in the register DEV_STAT, is set.
The Failure Output is activated due to the following failure conditions.
Failure Conditions
•   After one or two Watchdog Trigger failures depending on the configuration.
•   Thermal Shutdown TSD2.
•   VIO short to GND.
•   VIO overvoltage in case that VIO_OV_RST bit is set.
•   After four consecutive VIO undervoltage detection.
Configurations
Four different configurations can be selected. The selection is done using the pin INTN and the SPI bit CFG2.

In order to deactivate the Fail Output, the failure conditions (e.g. TSD2) must not be present anymore and the
bit FO_ON_STATE needs to be cleared via SPI command.
In case of Watchdog fail, the deactivation of the Fail Output is only allowed after a successful WD trigger, i.e.
the FO_ON_STATE bit must be cleared.
Note:        The Fail Output pin is triggered for any of the above described failure and not only for failures
             leading to the SBC Fail-Safe Mode.

12.1.1        Reset Output Description
The reset output pin RSTN provides a reset information to the microcontroller, e.g. when the VIO voltage falls
below the undervoltage threshold VRT1/2/3/4. In case of a reset event due to an undervoltage on VIO, the reset
output RSTN is pulled to LOW after the filter time tRF and stays LOW as long as the reset event is present plus
a reset delay time tRD1. When connecting the SBC to battery voltage, the reset signal remains LOW initially.
When the output voltage VIO has reached the default reset threshold VRT1,f, the reset output RSTN is released
to HIGH after the reset delay time tRD1. A reset can also occur due to a Watchdog trigger failure. The reset
threshold can be adjusted via SPI; the default reset threshold is VRT1,f. The RSTN pin has an integrated pull-up
resistor. In case reset is triggered, RSTN will pull LOW for VS ≥ VPOR,f.
The RSTN trigger timing regarding the VIO undervoltage and watchdog trigger is shown in Figure 32.

12.1.2       Soft Reset Description
In SBC Normal and Stop Mode, It is also possible to trigger a Soft Reset via an SPI command in order to bring
the SBC into a defined state in case of failures. In this case the microcontroller must send an SPI command and
set the MODE bits to ‘11’ in the M_S_CTRL register. As soon as this command becomes valid, the SBC is set
back to SBC Init Mode and all SPI registers are set to their default values (see SPI Chapter 13.5 and
Chapter 13.6).
As soon as the SBC is in SBC Init Mode due to a software reset, it is possible to change the device configuration
according to the FO/Test, INTN pins and CFG2 bit value. For more information, refer to Chapter 5.1.1.
Two different soft reset configurations are possible via the SPI bit SOFT_RESET_ RSTN:
•   The reset output (RSTN) is triggered when the soft reset is executed (default setting, the same reset delay
    time tRD1 applies).
•   The reset output (RSTN) is not triggered when the soft reset is executed.
Note:        The device must be in SBC Normal Mode or SBC Stop Mode when sending this command.
             Otherwise, the command will be ignored.
12.2         Watchdog
The watchdog is used to monitor the software execution of the microcontroller and to trigger a reset if the
microcontroller stops serving the watchdog due to a lock up in the software.
Two different types of watchdog functions are implemented and can be selected via the bit WD_WIN on the
WD_CTRL register:
•   Time-Out Watchdog (default value).
•   Window Watchdog.
The respective watchdog function can be selected and programmed in SBC Normal Mode. The configuration
remains unchanged in SBC Stop Mode.
Refer to Table 22 to match the SBC Modes with the respective Watchdog Modes.

Watchdog timing is programmed via an SPI command. As soon as the Watchdog is programmed, the timer
starts with the new setting and the Watchdog must be served.
The Watchdog is triggered by sending a valid SPI command with write access to WD_CTRL register. The trigger
SPI command is executed when the Chip Select input (CSN) becomes HIGH.

When coming from SBC Init, Restart or in certain cases Stop Mode, the watchdog timer starts with a long open
window.
The long open window (tLW) allows the microcontroller to run its initialization sequences and then to trigger
the Watchdog via the SPI.
The watchdog timer period can be selected via the watchdog timing bit field (WD_TIMER on WD_CTRL
register) and it is in the range of 10 ms up to 1000 ms. The timer setting is valid for both watchdog types.
The following Watchdog timer periods are available:
•   WD Setting 1: 10 ms
•   WD Setting 2: 20 ms
•   WD Setting 3: 50 ms
•   WD Setting 4: 100 ms
•   WD Setting 5: 200 ms (reset value)
•   WD Setting 6: 500 ms
•   WD Setting 7: 1000 ms
In case of a watchdog reset, SBC Restart Mode is started or SBC Fail-Safe Mode is entered according to the
configuration and WD_FAIL bits are set.
Once the RSTN goes HIGH again, the watchdog immediately starts with a long open window and the SBC
enters automatically in SBC Normal Mode.
In SBC Development Mode, no reset is generated due to watchdog failure; the watchdog is OFF.
In case of 3 consecutive resets due to WD fail, it is possible in config 1/3 not to generate additional resets by
setting the MAX_3_RST bit on WD_CTRL register.
12.2.1       Time-Out Watchdog
The time-out watchdog is an easier and less secure watchdog than a window watchdog as the watchdog
trigger can become active at any time within the configured watchdog timer period.
A correct watchdog service immediately results in starting a new watchdog timer period. Taking the
tolerances of the internal oscillator into account leads to the safe trigger area defined in Figure 33.

If the time-out watchdog period elapses, a watchdog reset is created by setting the reset output RSTN LOW
and the SBC switches to SBC Restart or SBC Fails-Safe Mode.
12.2.2         Window Watchdog
Compared to the time-out watchdog, the characteristic of the window watchdog is that the watchdog timer
period is divided between a closed and an open window. The watchdog must be triggered inside the open
window.
A correct watchdog trigger results in starting the window watchdog period by a closed window followed by an
open window.
The watchdog timer period is at the same time the typical trigger time and defines the middle of the open
window.
Taking the oscillator tolerances into account leads to a safe trigger area of:
tWD × 0.72 < safe trigger area < tWD × 1.20.
The typical closed window is defined to a width of 60% of the selected window watchdog timer period. Taking
the tolerances of the internal oscillator into account leads to the timings as defined in Figure 34.
A correct Watchdog service immediately results in starting the next closed window.
Should the trigger signal meet the closed window or should the watchdog timer period elapse, a watchdog
reset is created by setting the reset output RSTN LOW and the SBC switches to SBC Restart or Fail-Safe Mode.

12.2.3         Checksum
A checksum bit is part of the SPI command to trigger the watchdog and to set the watchdog setting. The sum
of the 8 bits in the register WD_CTRL needs to be even. This is realized by either setting the bit CHECKSUM to
“0” or “1”. If the checksum is wrong, the SPI command is ignored (watchdog not triggered, settings not
changed) and the bit SPI_FAIL is set.
The checksum is calculated by taking all 8 data bits into account.

12.2.4       Watchdog during Stop Mode
The watchdog can be disabled via SPI in Stop Mode.
For safety reasons, there is a special sequence to be ensured in order to disable the watchdog as described in
Figure 35. Two dedicated SPI bits (WD_STM_EN_0 and WD_STM_EN_1) in the registers WD_CTRL and
WK_CTRL_0.
If this sequence is not fulfilled, then the bit WD_STM_EN_1 will be cleared and the sequence has to be started
again. As soon as the SBC is set to SBC Normal Mode, then the bits WD_STM_EN_1 and WD_STM_EN_0 are
cleared and this sequence must be followed again to switch OFF the watchdog.
The watchdog can be enabled by triggering the watchdog in SBC Stop Mode or by switching back to SBC
Normal Mode via SPI. In both cases, the watchdog will start with a long open window and the bits
WD_STM_EN_1 and WD_STM_EN_0 are cleared. After the long open window, the watchdog has to be served
as configured in the WD_CTRL register.

Figure 35    Watchdog Disabling Sequence
Note:        The bit WD_STM_EN_0 will be cleared automatically when the sequence is started and it was “1”
             before.
12.2.4.1 Watchdog Start in SBC Stop Mode due to BUS Wake
In SBC Stop Mode the watchdog can be disabled. In addition a feature can be enabled to start the watchdog
with any BUS wake during Stop Mode. The feature is enabled by setting the bit WD_EN_WK_ BUS. The bit can
only be changed in SBC Normal Mode and needs to be programmed before entering SBC Stop Mode: it is not
reset by the SBC. The sequence described in Chapter 12.2.4 needs to be followed to disable the WD.
With the function enabled, the watchdog will start again with any wake on CANx. The wake on CANx will
generate an interrupt and the RXDCANx is pulled to low. The watchdog starts a with long open window. The
watchdog can be triggered in SBC Stop Mode or the SBC can be switched to SBC Normal Mode. To disable the
watchdog again, the SBC needs to be switched to Normal Mode and the sequence needs to be sent again.
The sequence is shown in Figure 36.

12.3           VS Power ON Reset
When powering up, the device detects the VS Power ON Reset when VS > VPOR,f, and the POR is set to indicate
that all SPI registers are set to POR default setting. The Buck regulator starts up. The RSTN output is kept LOW
and is only released when VIO has exceeded VRT1,r and after tRD1 has elapsed.
If VS<VPOR,f, an internal reset is generated and the SBC is switched OFF. The SBC will restart in SBC INIT Mode
when VS>VPOR,r rising. Timing behavior is shown in Figure 37.

12.5           Fast Battery Voltage Monitoring
A battery monitoring feature is implemented in the TLE9278BQX in order to provide a fast signalization path
to the microcontroller in case of low battery voltage condition.
The block diagram is shown in Figure 39. The functionality is as follows:
•   The battery voltage is monitored on the dedicated pin VBSENSE (see also the application diagram in
    Chapter 14.1).
•   If the voltage falls below the selected threshold, an interrupt is triggered at the INTN pin and the bit
    VBAT_UV_ LATCH in the register WK_STAT_2 is set.
•   The bit can be cleared via an SPI if the voltage is above the thresholds again.
•   The bit VBAT_UV_ STATE in the register WK_LVL_STAT is showing the actual level of the comparator
    output, i.e. if the battery voltage is below or above the selected monitoring threshold.
•   The monitoring threshold can be selected via SPI bit with VBSENSE_CFG in the WK_CTRL_0 register. The
    feature can be enable in SBC Normal, Stop and Restart Mode using VBSENSE_EN bit on the WK_CTRL_0
    register. Four thresholds are available: VBSENSE0,f...VBSENSE3,f.
•   The Fast Battery voltage monitoring feature is filtered with the time tF_VBSENSE.

12.6           VBSENSE Boost deactivation
In case of low battery voltage conditions, where the Boost module can operate out of nominal functional
range, it is possible to disable the boost and supply the VS pin only with the output boost capacitor.
The BST_VB_UV_ OFF bit enable this feature.
As soon as the battery voltage is crossing the BoostOFF,th threshold, the boost is disabled and VB_UV_BST is
set.
The Boost is automatically enabled when the VBSENSE is crossing BoostON,th threshold.
The VB_UV_BST bit has to be cleared manually.

12.7           VIO Undervoltage and Undervoltage Prewarning
A first-level voltage detection threshold is implemented as a prewarning for microcontroller. The prewarning
event is signaled with the bit VIO_WARN. No other actions are taken.
As described in Chapter 12.1 and shown in Figure 40, when the VIO voltage reaches the undervoltage
threshold (VRTx), a reset will be triggered (RSTN pulled ‘LOW’), the bit VIO_UV is set and the SBC will enter SBC
Restart Mode.
Note:          The VIO_WARN and VIO_UV bits are not set in SBC Sleep Mode as VIO = 0 V in this case.

Figure 40      VIO Undervoltage Timing Diagram
An additional safety mechanism is implemented to avoid repetitive VIO undervoltage resets:
•   A counter is increased for every consecutive VIO undervoltage event.
•   The counter is active in SBC Init, Normal and Stop Mode and as VS > VS,UV.
•   A 4th consecutive VIO undervoltage events will lead to SBC Fail-Safe Mode entry and to setting the bit
    VIO_UV_FS.
•   The counter is cleared when:
    – SBC Fail-Safe Mode is entered.
    – The bit VIO_UV is cleared.
    – A Soft Reset is triggered.
Note:          It is recommended to clear the VIO_UV bit once it was set and detected.
12.8           VIO Overvoltage
For fail safe reasons, a configurable VIO overvoltage detection feature is implemented.
In case the VIO,OV,r threshold is crossed, the SBC triggers following measures depending on the configuration:
•   The bit VIO_OV is always set.
•   If the bit VIO_OV_RST is set in config 1/3, then SBC Restart Mode is entered. The FO output is activated.
    After the reset delay time (tRD1), the SBC Restart Mode is exited and SBC Normal Mode is resumed even if
    the VIO overvoltage event is still present (see also Figure 41). The VIO_OV_RST bit is cleared
    automatically.
•   If the bit VIO_OV_RST is set in config 2/4, then SBC Fail-Safe Mode is entered and FO output is activated.

If the VIO_OV_RST bit is not set, one overvoltage event on VIO pin will set the VIO_OV bit but no reset is
generated and FO remains OFF. The SBC doesn’t change the SBC mode.

12.9          VIO Short Circuit
The following protection feature is implemented for VIO:
•   If PCFG = GND: when VIO stays below the undervoltage threshold VRTx for more than tVIO,SC, the SBC enters
    SBC Fail-Safe Mode and turns off VCC1 and VEXT. This feature is available only if VS > VS,UV and
    VCC1 > VCC1,UV. In addition, the SPI status bit VIO_SC is set. The SBC can exited SBC Fail Safe Mode via a
    wake-up event on CANx and/or WK pin.
•   If PCFG = Open: when VIO stays below the undervoltage threshold VRTx for more than tVIO,SC, the SBC
    enters SBC Fail-Safe Mode and turns off VCC1. This feature is available only if Vs > VS,UV. In addition the SPI
    status bit VIO_SC is set. The SBC can exited SBC Fail Safe Mode via a wake-up event on CANx and/or WK pin.
12.10         VEXT Undervoltage
Following protection feature is implemented for VEXT if PCFG = Open:
•   If VEXT drops below the VEXT,UV threshold, the SPI bit VREG_UV is set and can only be cleared via SPI.
If PCFG = GND, the VREG_UV refers to VCC1 undervoltage (VCC1 < VCC1,UV).
Note:         The VREG_UV flag is not set during turn-on or turn-off of VEXT.
12.11         Thermal Protection
The thermal protection mechanism is designed in such a way that the individual modules (VCC1, CANx, Boost
and VEXT) can remain active on as long as possible in case of high temperature. The following thermal
protection features are available and signaled via SPI:
•   Thermal Prewarning TjPW
•   Overtemperature Protection:
    – Overtemperature shut down with 2 levels of priority (TSD1 for peripherals and TSD2 for
        microcontroller supply).
    – The TSD1 status bit is a combination of CANx, Boost and VEXT thermal shutdown (if PCFG is open).
    – The TSD2 status bit is related to VCC1 only if PCFG = open, and VCC1 together with VEXT if PCFG=GND.

    – If PCFG is open and the VEXT base driver sensor detected that TjTSD1 has been reached, it is switched
       OFF as an initial protection measure. The control bits (VEXT_ON bits on M_S_CTRL register) are reset
       and the bits VEXT_OT and TSD1 are set. The other output stages are not affected if their TjTSD1
       threshold is not reached. When the overtemperature event is not present anymore, the VEXT must be
       switched ON by setting the VEXT_ON bit.
    – If PCFG = GND and the VEXT base driver sensor detected that TjTSD2 has been reached, it is switched OFF
       as an initial protection measure. The VEXT_OT and TSD2 are set.
    – If one of the CANx output stages reaches the TjTSD1 temperature threshold, then the transmitter is
       switched OFF individually as first-level protection measure. The respective control bits are not reset
       and the TSD1 and CAN_x_FAIL bits are set. The CANx drivers are automatically switched on again when
       the overtemperature condition is no longer present. The user has to reset the BUS_STAT_0 and
       BUS_STAT_2 registers via SPI.
    – If VCC1 reaches the TjTSD2 temperature threshold, the SBC is sent to SBC Fail-Safe Mode. The SBC stays
       in SBC Fail-Safe Mode for at least tTSD2 (typ.1s) after the TSD2 event is not present anymore. The
       VCC1_OT is set.The default wake sources CANx and WK are enabled together with the Fail Safe output.
    – Boost Switched OFF in case of TSD1 along with the BOOST_OT bit. The Boost has to activate again
       setting the BOOST_EN after the thermal shutdown event.
    – Once the respective bits (TSD1, TSD2) are set, they can be cleared via SPI if the condition is not present
       anymore.
12.11.1      Temperature Prewarning
As a next level of thermal protection a temperature prewarning is implemented if the main supply VCC1
reaches the thermal prewarning temperature threshold TjPW. Then the status bit TPW is set. This bit can only
be cleared via SPI once the overtemperature is not present anymore. The thermal prewarning is only active if
the VCC1 is in PWM mode.

13.1          SPI Protocol Description
The 16-bit wide Control Input Word is read via the data input SDI, which is synchronized with the clock input
CLK provided by the microcontroller. The output word appears synchronously at the data output SDO (see
Figure 42).The transmission cycle begins when the chip is selected by the input CSN (Chip Select Not), LOW
active. After the CSN input returns from LOW to HIGH, the word that has been read is interpreted according to
the content. The SDO output switches to tristate status (HIGH impedance) at this point, thereby releasing the
SDO bus for other use.The state of SDI is shifted into the input register with every falling edge on CLK. The state
of SDO is shifted out of the output register after every rising edge on CLK. The SPI of the SBC is not daisy-chain
capable.
            CSN high to low: SDO is enabled. Status information transferred to output shift register

13.2           Failure Signalization in the SPI Data Output
When the microcontroller sends a wrong SPI command to the SBC, the SBC ignores the information. Wrong
SPI commands are either invalid SBC mode commands or commands which are prohibited by the state
machine to avoid undesired device or system states (see below). In this case the diagnosis bit ‘SPI_FAIL’ is set
and the SPI Write command is ignored (mostly no partial interpretation). This bit can only be reset by actively
clearing it via a SPI command.
Invalid SPI Commands leading to SPI_FAIL are listed below:
•   Illegal state transitions: going from SBC Stop to SBC Sleep Mode. In this case the SBC additionally enters
    the SBC Restart Mode.
    Trying to go to SBC Stop or SBC Sleep mode from SBC Init Mode. In this case SBC Normal Mode is entered.
•   Uneven parity in the data bit of the WD_CTRL register. In this case either the watchdog trigger is ignored
    or the new watchdog settings are ignored.
•   In SBC Stop Mode: attempting to change any SPI settings , e.g. changing the watchdog configuration
    during SBC Stop Mode.
    the SPI command is ignored in this case.
    The following are allowed in SBC Stop Mode: WD trigger, returning to SBC Normal Mode , triggering a SBC
    Soft Reset, set to SBC Stop Mode (to return from PWM to PFM following an automatic Buck mode
    transition) and Read & Clear status register commands are valid SPI commands in SBC Stop Mode.
•   When entering SBC Stop Mode and WK_STAT_0 and WK_STAT_2 are not cleared; SPI_FAIL will not be set
    but the INTN pin will be triggered.
•   When changing from SBC Stop to Normal Mode, any attempt to change the bits on the M_S_CTRL register
    will be ignored (SBC remains in SBC Stop Mode). Only VIO_OV_RST and VIO_RT set the SPI_FAIL bit.
•   SBC Sleep Mode: attempt to go to Sleep Mode when all bits in the BUS_CTRL_0, BUS_CTRL_2,
    BUS_CTRL_3 and WK_CTRL_1 registers are cleared (i.e. no wake sources are activated). In this case the
    SPI_FAIL bit is set and the SBC enters SBC Restart Mode.
    Even though the SBC Sleep Mode command is not entered in this case, the rest of the command (e.g
    modifying VEXT) is executed and the values stay unchanged during SBC Restart Mode.
    Note: at least one wake source must be activated in order to avoid a deadlock situation in SBC Sleep Mode,
    i.e. the SBC would not be able to wake up anymore.
    No failure handling occurs for the attempt to go to SBC Stop Mode when all bits in the registers
    BUS_CTRL_0, BUS_CTRL_2, BUS_CTRL_3 and WK_CTRL_1 are cleared because the microcontroller can
    leave this mode via SPI.
•   After the first VEXT on command, the VEXT_VCFG bits can no longer be changed. if the microcontroller
    tries to modify the VEXT_VCFG bits, then the rest of the command is executed but VEXT_VCFG will remain
    unchanged.
•   The Boost output voltage can be changed only if BOOST_EN is set to 0. If the Boost output voltage is
    changed with BOOST_EN=1, the SPI_FAIL bit is set and the SPI command is ignored.
•   SDI stuck at HIGH or LOW, e.g. SDI received all ‘0’ or all ‘1’.
Signalization of the ERR flag in the SPI data output (see Figure 42):
The ERR flag presents an additional diagnosis possibility for the SPI communication. The ERR flag is being set
for the following conditions:
•   In case the number of received SPI clocks is not 0 or 16.
•   In case RSTN is LOW and SPI frames are being sent at the same time.

Note:          In order to read the SPI ERR flag property, CLK must be low when CSN is triggered, i.e. the ERR bit is
               not valid if the CLK is high on a falling edge of CSN.
The number of received SPI clocks is not 0 or 16:
The number of received input clocks is supervised to be 0 or 16 clock cycles and the input word is discarded in
case of a mismatch (0 clock cycle to enable ERR signalization). The error logic also recognizes if CLK was high
during the CSN edges. Both errors, 0 bit and 16 bit CLK mismatch or CLK high during CSN edges are flagged in
the following SPI output by a “HIGH” at the data output (SDO pin, bit ERR) before the first rising edge of the
clock is received. The error logic also recognizes if CLK was HIGH during CSN edges. The entire SPI command
is ignored in these cases.
RSTN is LOW and SPI frames are being sent at the same time:
The ERR flag will be set when the RSTN pin is triggered (during SBC Restart Mode) and SPI frames are being
sent to the SBC at the same time. The behavior of the ERR flag signaled at the next SPI command when the
condition below are present:
•    If the command begins when RSTN is HIGH and ends when RSTN is LOW.
•    If an SPI command is sent while RSTN is LOW.
•    If an SPI command begins when RSTN is LOW and ends when RSTN is HIGH.
And the SDO output will behave as follows:
•    When RSTN is LOW, SDO is always HIGH.
•    When SPI command begins with RSTN is LOW and ends when RSTN is HIGH, then the SDO should be
     ignored because wrong data will be sent.
Note:          It is possible to quickly check for the ERR flag without sending any data bits. i.e. only the CSN is pulled
               low and SDO is observed - no SPI clocks are sent in this case.
Note:          The ERR flag could also be set after the SBC has entered SBC Fail-Safe Mode because SPI
               communication stops immediately.

13.3          SPI Programming
For TLE9278, 7 bits are used for the address selection (6...0). Bit 7 is used to control the SPI Access, i.e. to decide
between Read Only (if set to ‘0’) and Read_Clear (if set to ‘1’) for the status bits, and between Write (if set to
‘1’) and Read Only (if set to ‘0’) for configuration bits. For the actual configuration and status information, 8
data bits (15...8) are used.
Writing, clearing and reading is done byte wise. SPI configuration and status bits are not cleared automatically
and must be cleared by the microcontroller, e.g. if the TSD2 was set due to overtemperature. The
configuration bits will be partially automatically cleared by the SBC (refer to the description of the individual
registers for detailed information). During SBC Restart, Sleep or Fail-Safe mode, the SPI communication is
ignored by the SBC, i.e. it is not interpreted.
There are two types of SPI registers:
•    Control registers: Those are the registers to configure the SBC, e.g. SBC mode, watchdog trigger, etc.
•    Status registers: Those are the registers where the status of the SBC is signalled, e.g. wake-up events,
     warnings, failures, etc.
For the status registers, the requested information is given in the same SPI command in DO.
For the control registers, also the status of the respective bit is shown in the same SPI command, but if the
setting is changed this is only shown with the next SPI command (it is only valid after CSN HIGH) of the same
register.
The SBC status information from the SPI status registers, is transmitted in a compressed way with each SPI
response on SDO in the so called Status Information Field register (see also Figure 43).

The purpose of this register is to quickly signal the information to the microcontroller if there was a change in
one of the SPI status registers. In this way, the microcontroller does not need to read constantly all the SPI
status registers but only those registers, which were changed. Each bit in the Status Information Field

For example if bit 2 in the Status Information Field is set to 1, one or more bits of the register DEV_STAT is set
to 1. Then this register needs to be read in a second SPI command. The bit in the Status Information Field will
be set to 0 when all bits in the register DEV_STAT are set back to 0.

13.4          SPI Bit Mapping
13.4.1        SPI Mapping Structure
Figure 44 and Figure 45 show the mapping of the SPI bits and the respective registers.
Depending on bit 7, the bits are only read or also written. The Control Registers ‘000 0001’ to ‘011 1111’ are
READ/WRITE Registers.
 The new setting of the bit after write can be seen with the next read / write command. .
The registers ‘100 0000’ to ‘111 1110’ are Status Registers and can be read or read with clearing the bit (if
possible) depending on bit 7. To clear a Data Byte of one of the Status Registers, bit 7 must be set to 1. The
register WK_LVL_STAT is an exception as it shows the actual voltage level at the respective pin (LOW/HIGH)
and thus can not be cleared.
When changing to a different SBC Mode, certain configurations and status bits will be modified by the SBC:
•   The SBC Mode bits are updated to the actual status, e.g. when returning to SBC Normal Mode.
•   In SBC Sleep Mode the CANx control bits will be modified in CANx wake capable if they were ON before.
    FO will stay activated if it was triggered before.
•   In general, the configurations is only possible in SBC Normal Mode. Diagnosis are also active in SBC Stop
    Mode (e.g. UV, OT). VEXT can be also active in Low power mode (Stop/Sleep).
•   Depending on the respective configuration, CANx transceivers will be either OFF, woken or still wake
    capable.

13.5           SPI Control Registers
Read / Write Operation (see Chapter 13.3):
•   The ‘POR / Soft Reset Value’ defines the register content after POR or SBC Software Reset.
•   The ‘Restart Value’ defines the register content after SBC Restart; ‘x’ means the bit is unchanged.
•   ‘y’ in ‘Restart Value’ means the bit can be changed by SBC.
•   One 16-bit SPI command consist of two bytes:
    - the 7-bit address and one additional bit for the register access mode and
    - following the data byte
    The numbering of following bit definitions refers to the data byte and correspond to the bits D0...D7 and to
    the SPI bits 8...15.
•   There are three different bit types:
    – ‘r’ = READ; read only bits (or reserved bits).
    – ‘rw’ = READ/WRITE; readable and writable bits.
    – ‘rwh’ = READ/WRITE/HARDWARE; as rw with the possibility that the hardware can change the bits.
•   Reading a register is done byte wise by setting the SPI bit 7 to “0” (= Read Only).
•   Writing to a register is done byte wise by setting the SPI bit 7 to “1”.
•   SPI control bits are not cleared or changed automatically. This must be done by the microcontroller via SPI
    programming.
The registers are addressed wordwise.

Notes
1. It is not possible to change from SBC Stop to Sleep Mode via an SPI Command. See also the State Machine
    Chapter.
2. After entering SBC Restart Mode, the MODE bits will be automatically set to SBC Normal Mode.
3. The SPI output will always show the previously written state with a Write Command (what has been
    programmed before).

Notes
1. The FO_ON bit is cleared by the SBC after SBC Restart Mode. Clearing the bit via SPI or via SBC Restart Mode
    will not disable the FO output, if the failure condition is still present. See also Chapter 11 for FO activation and
    deactivation. Setting the FO output via an SPI should be used for testing purposes only.
2. The selection between Config 1/3 respectively Config 2/4 is done by the pin INTN. The INTN pin defines if the
    SBC enters to SBC Fail-Safe Mode with VCC1 OFF in case of a watchdog failure.

1. See Figure 18 for detailed state changes of the CAN Transceiver for different SBC modes.
2. Failure Handling Mechanism: When the SBC enters SBC Fail-Safe Mode due to a failure (e.g. TSD2, WD-
    Failure), then the bus and wake registers are modified by the SBC in order to ensure that the device can be
    woken again. Refer to the respective register descriptions.

Notes
1. The SYS_STATUS_CTRL register is an exception for the default values, i.e. it will keep its configured value
    even after a Software Reset.
2. This byte is intended for storing system configurations of the ECU by the microcontroller and is only accessible
    in SBC Normal Mode. The byte is not accessible by the SBC and is also not cleared after SBC Fail-Safe or
    Restart Mode. It allows the microcontroller to quickly store the system configuration without losing the data.

13.6           SPI Status Information Registers
Read/Clear Operation (see Chapter 13.3):
•   One 16-bit SPI command consist of two bytes:
    - the 7-bit address and one additional bit for the register access mode and
    - following the data byte will be ignored when accessing a status register
    The numbering of following bit definitions refers to the data byte and correspond to the bits D0...D7 and to
    the SPI bits 8...15.
•   There are three different bit types:
    - ‘r’ = READ: read only bits (or reserved bits)
    - ‘rc’ = READ/CLEAR: readable and clearable bits
    - ‘rh’ = READ/HARDWARE: readable and the possibility that the hardware can change the bits
•   Reading a register is done byte wise by setting the SPI bit 7 to “0” (= Read Only)
•   Clearing a register is done byte wise by setting the SPI bit 7 to “1”
•   SPI status registers are in general not cleared or changed automatically (an exception are the WD_FAIL
    bits). This must be done by the microcontroller via SPI command
The registers are addressed wordwise.

1. The VIO undervoltage prewarning threshold VPW,f is a fixed threshold and independent of the VIO
    undervoltage reset thresholds.
2. VIO_WARN bit setting: It is never updated in SBC Restart Mode. In SBC Init Mode it is only updated after RSTN
    was released for the first time. It is always updated in SBC Normal and Stop Mode. It is never updated in SBC

Notes
1. The MSB of the POR/Soft Reset value is marked as ‘y’: the default value of the POR bit is set after Power-on
    reset (POR value = 1000 0000). However it will be cleared after a SBC Software Reset command (Soft Reset
    value = 0000 0000).
2. During SBC Sleep Mode, the bits VIO_SC, VIO_OV and VIO_UV will not be set because the regulator suppling
    VIO is off.
3. The VIO_UV bit is never updated in SBC Restart Mode. In SBC Init Mode, it is only updated after RSTN was
    released for the first time. It is always updated in SBC Normal and Stop Mode, and it is always updated in any
    SBC modes in a VIO_SC condition (after VIO_UV = 1 longer than tVIO,SC).

Notes
1. The WD_FAIL bits are configured as a counter and are the only status bits, which are cleared automatically
    by the SBC. They are cleared after a successful watchdog trigger and when the watchdog is stopped (also in
    SBC Sleep and Fail-Safe Mode unless it was reached due to a watchdog failure). See also Chapter 11.1.
2. The SPI_FAIL bit is cleared only by SPI command.
3. With Config 2/4, the WD_Fail counter is frozen in case of WD trigger failure until a successful WD trigger occurs.

Notes
1. CAN0 Recovery Conditions:
    1.) TXD Time Out: TXDCAN0 goes HIGH or transmitter is switched off or the transceiver is wake capable.
    2.) Bus dominant time out: Bus will become recessive or transceiver is set to wake capable or switched off.
    3.) Supply undervoltage: as soon as the threshold is crossed again, i.e. VCAN > VCAN_UV.
    4.) In all cases (also for TSD shutdown): to enable the Bus transmission again, TXDCAN0 needs to be HIGH for
    a certain time (transmitter enable time).
2. The VCAN_UV comparator is enabled if the mode bit CANx_1 = ‘1’, i.e. in CAN Normal or CAN Receive Only
    Mode.
