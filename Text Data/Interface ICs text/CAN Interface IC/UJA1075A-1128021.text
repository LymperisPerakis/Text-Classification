                 Rev. 02 — 28 January 2011                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
             The UJA1075A core System Basis Chip (SBC) replaces the basic discrete components
             commonly found in Electronic Control Units (ECU) with a high-speed Controller Area
             Network (CAN) and a Local Interconnect Network (LIN) interface.
             The UJA1075A supports the networking applications used to control power and sensor
             peripherals by using a high-speed CAN as the main network interface and the LIN
             interface as a local sub-bus.
             The core SBC contains the following integrated devices:
               • High-speed CAN transceiver, inter-operable and downward compatible with CAN
                  transceiver TJA1042, and compatible with the ISO 11898-2 and ISO 11898-5
                  standards
               • LIN transceiver compliant with LIN 2.1, LIN 2.0 and SAE J2602, and compatible with
                  LIN 1.3
               • Advanced independent watchdog (UJA1075A/xx/WD versions)
               • 250 mA voltage regulator for supplying a microcontroller; extendable with external
                  PNP transistor for increased current capability and dissipation distribution
               •  Separate voltage regulator for supplying the on-board CAN transceiver
               •  Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) (full duplex)
               •  2 local wake-up input ports
               •  Limp home output port
             In addition to the advantages gained from integrating these common ECU functions in a
             single package, the core SBC offers an intelligent combination of system-specific
             functions such as:
               • Advanced low-power concept
               • Safe and controlled system start-up behavior
               • Detailed status reporting on system and sub-system levels
             The UJA1075A is designed to be used in combination with a microcontroller that
             incorporates a CAN controller. The SBC ensures that the microcontroller always starts up
             in a controlled manner.

6. Functional description
                   The UJA1075A combines the functionality of a high-speed CAN transceiver, a LIN
                   transceiver, two voltage regulators and a watchdog (UJA1075A/xx/WD versions) in a
                   single, dedicated chip. It handles the power-up and power-down functionality of the ECU
                   and ensures advanced system reliability. The SBC offers wake-up by bus activity, by
                   cyclic wake-up and by the activation of external switches. Additionally, it provides a
                   periodic control signal for pulsed testing of wake-up switches, allowing low-current
                   operation even when the wake-up switches are closed in Standby mode.
                   All transceivers are optimized to be highly flexible with regard to bus topologies. In
                   particular, the high-speed CAN transceiver is optimized to reduce ringing (bus reflections).
                   V1, the main voltage regulator, is designed to power the ECU's microcontroller, its
                   peripherals and additional external transceivers. An external PNP transistor can be added
                   to improve heat distribution. V2 supplies the integrated high-speed CAN transceiver. The
                   watchdog is clocked directly by the on-chip oscillator and can be operated in Window,
                   Timeout and Off modes.

                   6.1 System Controller
                6.1.1 Introduction
                       The system controller manages register configuration and controls the internal functions
                       of the SBC. Detailed device status information is collected and presented to the
                       microcontroller. The system controller also provides the reset and interrupt signals.
                       The system controller is a state machine. The SBC operating modes, and how transitions
                       between modes are triggered, are illustrated in Figure 3. These modes are discussed in
                       more detail in the following sections.

                6.1.2 Off mode
                      The SBC switches to Off mode from all other modes if the battery supply drops below the
                      power-off detection threshold (Vth(det)poff). In Off mode, the voltage regulators are disabled
                      and the bus systems are in a high-resistive state. The CAN bus pins are floating in this
                      mode.
                      As soon as the battery supply rises above the power-on detection threshold (Vth(det)pon),
                      the SBC goes to Standby mode, and a system reset is executed (reset pulse width of
                      tw(rst), long or short; see Section 6.5.1 and Table 11).
                6.1.3 Standby mode
                      The SBC will enter Standby mode:
                        • From Off mode if VBAT rises above the power-on detection threshold (Vth(det)pon)
                        • From Sleep mode on the occurrence of a CAN, LIN or local wake-up event
                        • From Overtemp mode if the chip temperature drops below the overtemperature
                            protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp
                        • From Normal mode if bit MC is set to 00 or a system reset is performed (see
                            Section 6.5)
                      In Standby mode, V1 is switched on. The CAN and LIN transceivers will either be in a
                      low-power state (Lowpower mode; STBCC/STBCL = 1; see Table 6) with bus wake-up
                      detection enabled or completely switched off (Off mode; STBCC/STBCL = 0) - see
                      Section 6.7.1 and Section 6.8.1. The watchdog can be running in Timeout mode or Off
                      mode, depending on the state of the WDOFF pin and the setting of the watchdog mode
                      control bit (WMC) in the WD_and_Status register (Table 4).
                      The SBC will exit Standby mode if:
                        • Normal mode is selected by setting bits MC to 10 (V2 disabled) or 11 (V2 enabled)
                        • Sleep mode is selected by setting bits MC to 01
                        • The chip temperature rises above the OverTemperature Protection (OTP) activation
                            threshold, Tth(act)otp, causing the SBC to enter Overtemp mode
                6.1.4 Normal mode
                      Normal mode is selected from Standby mode by setting bits MC in the Mode_Control
                      register (Table 5) to 10 (V2 disabled) or 11 (V2 enabled).
                      In Normal mode, the CAN physical layer will be enabled (Active mode; STBCC = 0; see
                      Table 6) or in a low-power state (Lowpower mode; STBCC = 1) with bus wake-up
                      detection active.
                      In Normal mode, the LIN physical layer will be enabled (Active mode; STBCL = 0; see
                      Table 6) or in a low-power state (Lowpower mode; STBCL = 1) with bus wake-up
                      detection active.
                      The SBC will exit Normal mode if:
                        • Standby mode is selected by setting bits MC to 00
                        • Sleep mode is selected by setting bits MC to 01
                        • A system reset is generated (see Section 6.1.3; the SBC will enter Standby mode)

                         • The chip temperature rises above the OTP activation threshold, Tth(act)otp, causing the
                            SBC to switch to Overtemp mode
                6.1.5 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode is selected from Standby mode or Normal mode by setting bits MC in the
                       Mode_Control register (Table 5) to 01. The SBC will enter Sleep mode providing there are
                       no pending interrupts (pin INTN = HIGH) or wake-up events and at least one wake-up
                       source is enabled (CAN, LIN or WAKE). Any attempt to enter Sleep mode while one of
                       these conditions has not been satisfied will result in a short reset (3.6 ms minimum pulse
                       width; see Section 6.5.1 and Table 11).
                       In Sleep mode, V1 and V2 are off and the bus transceivers will be switched off (Off mode;
                       STBCC/STBCL = 0; see Table 6) or in a low-power state (Lowpower mode;
                       STBCC/STBCL = 1) with bus wake-up detection active - see Section 6.7.1 and
                       Section 6.8.1). The watchdog is off and the reset pin is LOW.
                       A CAN, LIN or local wake-up event will cause the SBC to switch from Sleep mode to
                       Standby mode, generating a (short or long; see Section 6.5.1) system reset. The value of
                       the mode control bits (MC) will be changed to 00 and V1 will be enabled.
                6.1.6 Overtemp mode
                       The SBC will enter Overtemp mode from Normal mode or Standby mode when the chip
                       temperature exceeds the overtemperature protection activation threshold, Tth(act)otp,
                       In Overtemp mode, the voltage regulators are switched off and the bus systems are in a
                       high-resistive state. When the SBC enters Overtemp mode, the RSTN pin is driven LOW
                       and the limp home control bit, LHC, is set so that the LIMP pin is driven LOW.
                       The chip temperature must drop a hysteresis level below the overtemperature shutdown
                       threshold before the SBC can exit Overtemp mode. After leaving Overtemp mode the
                       SBC enters Standby mode and a system reset is generated (reset pulse width of tw(rst),
                       long or short; see Section 6.5.1 and Table 11).
                   6.2 SPI
                6.2.1 Introduction
                       The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) provides the communication link with the
                       microcontroller, supporting multi-slave operations. The SPI is configured for full duplex
                       data transfer, so status information is returned when new control data is shifted in. The
                       interface also offers a read-only access option, allowing registers to be read back by the
                       application without changing the register content.
                       The SPI uses four interface signals for synchronization and data transfer:
                         •  SCSN: SPI chip select; active LOW
                         •  SCK: SPI clock; default level is LOW due to low-power concept
                         •  SDI: SPI data input
                         •  SDO: SPI data output; floating when pin SCSN is HIGH
                       Bit sampling is performed on the falling clock edge and data is shifted on the rising clock
                       edge (see Figure 4).

                                                                                                 High-speed CAN/LIN core system basis chip
                   6.4 Watchdog (UJA1075A/xx/WD versions)
                       Three watchdog modes are supported: Window, Timeout and Off. The watchdog period is
                       programmed via the NWP control bits in the WD_and_Status register (see Table 4). The
                       default watchdog period is 128 ms.
                       A watchdog trigger event is any write access to the WD_and_Status register. When the
                       watchdog is triggered, the watchdog timer is reset.
                       In watchdog Window mode, a watchdog trigger event within a closed watchdog window
                       (i.e. the first half of the window before ttrig(wd)1) will generate an SBC reset. If the watchdog
                       is triggered before the watchdog timer overflows in Timeout or Window mode, or within
                       the open watchdog window (after ttrig(wd)1 but before ttrig(wd)2), the timer restarts
                       immediately.
                       The following watchdog events result in an immediate system reset:
                          •  the watchdog overflows in Window mode
                          •  the watchdog is triggered in the first half of the watchdog period in Window mode
                          •  the watchdog overflows in Timeout mode while a cyclic interrupt (CI) is pending
                          •  the state of the WDOFF pin changes in Normal mode or Standby mode
                          •  the watchdog mode control bit (WMC) changes state in Normal mode
                       After a watchdog reset (short reset; see Section 6.5.1 and Table 11), the default watchdog
                       period is selected (NWP = 100). The watchdog can be switched off completely by forcing
                       pin WDOFF HIGH. The watchdog can also be switched off by setting bit WMC to 1 in
                       Standby mode. If the watchdog was turned off by setting WMC, any pending interrupt will
                       re-enable it.
                       Note that the state of bit WMC cannot be changed in Standby mode if an interrupt is
                       pending. Any attempt to change WMC when an interrupt is pending will be ignored.
                6.4.1 Watchdog Window behavior
                       The watchdog runs continuously in Window mode.
                       If the watchdog overflows, or is triggered in the first half of the watchdog period (less than
                       ttrig(wd)1 after the start of the watchdog period), a system reset will be performed.
                       Watchdog overflow occurs if the watchdog is not triggered within ttrig(wd)2 after the start of
                       the watchdog period.
                       If the watchdog is triggered in the second half of the watchdog period (at least ttrig(wd)1, but
                       not more than ttrig(wd)2, after the start of the watchdog period), the watchdog will be reset.
                       The watchdog is in Window mode when pin WDOFF is LOW, the SBC is in Normal mode
                       and the watchdog mode control bit (WMC) is set to 0.
                6.4.2 Watchdog Timeout behavior
                       The watchdog runs continuously in Timeout mode. It can be reset at any time by a
                       watchdog trigger. If the watchdog overflows, the CI bit is set. If a CI is already pending, a
                       system reset is performed.
                       The watchdog is in Timeout mode when pin WDOFF is LOW and:

                                                                                             High-speed CAN/LIN core system basis chip
                         • the SBC is in Standby mode and bit WMC = 0 or
                         • the SBC is in Normal mode and bit WMC = 1
                6.4.3 Watchdog Off behavior
                       The watchdog is disabled in this state.
                       The watchdog is in Off mode when:
                         • the SBC is in Off, Overtemp or Sleep modes
                         • the SBC is in Standby mode and bit WMC = 1
                         • the SBC is in any mode and the WDOFF pin is HIGH
                   6.5 System reset
                       The following events will cause the SBC to perform a system reset:
                         • V1 undervoltage (reset pulse length selected via external pull-up resistor on RSTN
                           pin)
                         • An external reset (pin RSTN forced LOW)
                         • Watchdog overflow (Window mode)
                         • Watchdog overflow in Timeout mode with CI pending
                         • Watchdog triggered too early in Window mode
                         • WMC value changed in Normal mode
                         • WDOFF pin state changed
                         • SBC goes to Sleep mode (MC set to 01; see Table 5) while pin INTN is driven LOW
                         • SBC goes to Sleep mode (MC set to 01; see Table 5) while
                           STBCC = STBCL = WIC1 = WIC2 = 0
                         • SBC goes to Sleep mode (MC set to 01; see Table 5) while wake-up pending
                         • Software reset (SWR = 1)
                         • SBC leaves Overtemp mode (reset pulse length selected via external pull-up resistor
                           on RSTN pin)
                       A watchdog overflow in Timeout mode requests a CI, if a CI is not already pending.
                       The UJA1075A provides three signals for dealing with reset events:
                         • RSTN pin input/output for performing a global ECU system reset or forcing an
                           external reset
                         • EN pin, a fail-safe global enable output
                         • LIMP pin, a fail-safe limp home output
                6.5.1 RSTN pin
                       A system reset is triggered if the bidirectional RSTN pin is forced LOW for at least tfltr by
                       the microcontroller (external reset). A reset pulse is output on pin RSTN by the SBC when
                       a system reset is triggered internally.

                                                                                              High-speed CAN/LIN core system basis chip
                      The reset pulse width (tw(rst)) is selectable (short or long) if the system reset was
                      generated by a V1 undervoltage event (see Section 6.6.2) or by the SBC leaving Off
                      (VBAT > Vth(det)pon) or Overtemp (temperature < Tth(rel)otp) modes. A short reset pulse is
                      selected by connecting a 900 Ω ±10 % resistor between pins RSTN and V1. If a resistor is
                      not connected, the reset pulse will be long (see Table 11).
                      In all other cases (e.g. watchdog-related reset events) the reset pulse length will be short.
                6.5.2 EN output
                      The EN pin can be used to control external hardware, such as power components, or as a
                      general-purpose output when the system is running properly.
                      In Normal and Standby modes, the microcontroller can set the EN control bit (bit ENC in
                      the Mode_Control register; see Table 5) via the SPI interface. Pin EN will be HIGH when
                      ENC = 1 and MC = 10 or 11. A reset event will cause pin EN to go LOW. EN pin behavior
                      is illustrated in Figure 5.

                        Fig 5.    Behavior of EN pin
                6.5.3 LIMP output
                      The LIMP pin can be used to enable the so called ‘limp home’ hardware in the event of an
                      ECU failure. Detectable failure conditions include SBC overtemperature events, loss of
                      watchdog service, pins RSTN or V1 clamped LOW and user-initiated or external reset
                      events.
                      The LIMP pin is a battery-related, active-LOW, open-drain output.
                      A system reset will cause the limp home warning control bit (bit LHWC in the
                      Mode_Control register; see Table 5) to be set. If LHWC is already set when the system
                      reset is generated, bit LHC will be set which will force the LIMP pin LOW. The application
                      should clear LHWC after each reset event to ensure the LIMP output is not activated
                      during normal operation.
                      In Overtemp mode, bit LHC is always set and, consequently, the LIMP output is always
                      active. If the application manages to recover from the event that activated the LIMP
                      output, LHC can be cleared to deactivate the LIMP output.

                                                                                               High-speed CAN/LIN core system basis chip
                   6.6 Power supplies
                6.6.1 Battery pin (BAT)
                       The SBC contains a single supply pin, BAT. An external diode is needed in series to
                       protect the device against negative voltages. The operating range is from 4.5 V to 28 V.
                       The SBC can handle maximum voltages up to 40 V.
                       If the voltage on pin BAT falls below the power-off detection threshold, Vth(det)poff, the SBC
                       immediately enters Off mode, which means that the voltage regulators and the internal
                       logic are shut down. The SBC leaves Off mode for Standby mode as soon as the voltage
                       rises above the power-on detection threshold (Vth(det)pon). The POSI bit in the Int_Status
                       register is set to 1 when the SBC leaves Off mode.
                6.6.2 Voltage regulator V1
                       Voltage regulator V1 is intended to supply the microcontroller, its periphery and additional
                       transceivers. V1 is supplied by pin BAT and delivers up to 250 mA at 3.3 V or 5 V
                       (depending on the UJA1075A version).
                       To prevent the device overheating at high ambient temperatures or high average currents,
                       an external PNP transistor can be connected as illustrated in Figure 6. In this
                       configuration, the power dissipation is distributed between the SBC and the PNP
                       transistor. Bit PDC in the Mode_Control register (Table 5) is used to regulate how the
                       power dissipation is distributed. If PDC = 0, the PNP transistor will be activated when the
                       load current reaches 85 mA (50 mA if PDC = 1) at Tvj = 150 °C. V1 will continue to deliver
                       85 mA while the transistor delivers the additional load current (see Figure 7 and Figure 8).
                                                                                                         VEXCTRL

                   Figure 7 illustrates how V1 and the PNP transistor combine to supply a slow ramping load
                   current of 250 mA with PDC = 0. Any additional load current requirement will be supplied
                   by the PNP transistor, up to its current limit. If the load current continues to rise, IV1 will
                   increase above the selected PDC threshold (to a maximum of 250 mA).
                   For a fast ramping load current, V1 will deliver the required load current (to a maximum of
                   250 mA) until the PNP transistor has switched on. Once the transistor has been activated,
                   V1 will deliver 85 mA (PDC = 0) with the transistor contributing the balance of the load
                   current (see Figure 8).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                   UJA1075A
                                                                                                High-speed CAN/LIN core system basis chip
                       For short-circuit protection, a resistor needs to be connected between pins V1 and
                       VEXCC to allow the current to be monitored. This resistor limits the current delivered by
                       the external transistor. If the voltage difference between pins VEXCC and V1 reaches
                       Vth(act)Ilim, the PNP current limiting activation threshold voltage, the transistor current will
                       not increase further.
                       The thermal performance of the transistor needs to be considered when calculating the
                       value of this resistor. A 3.3 Ω resistor was used with the BCP52-16 (NXP Semiconductors)
                       employed during testing. Note that the selection of the transistor is not critical. In general,
                       any PNP transistor with a current amplification factor (β) of between 60 and 500 can be
                       used.
                       If an external PNP transistor is not used, pin VEXCC must be connected to V1 while pin
                       VEXCTRL can be left open.
                       One advantage of this scalable voltage regulator concept is that there are no PCB layout
                       restrictions when using the external PNP. The distance between the UJA1075A and the
                       external PNP doesn’t affect the stability of the regulator loop because the loop is realized
                       within the UJA1075A. Therefore, it is recommended that the distance between the
                       UJA1075A and PNP transistor be maximized for optimal thermal distribution.
                       The output voltage on V1 is monitored continuously and a system reset signal is
                       generated if an undervoltage event occurs. A system reset is generated if the voltage on
                       V1 falls below the undervoltage detection voltage (Vuvd; see Table 10). The reset
                       threshold (90 % or 70 % of the nominal value) is set via the Reset Threshold Control bit
                       (RTHC) in the Int_Control register (Table 6). In addition, an undervoltage warning (a V1UI
                       interrupt) will be generated at 90 % of the nominal output voltage. The status of V1 can be
                       read via bit V1S in the WD_and_Status register (Table 4).
                6.6.3 Voltage regulator V2
                       Voltage regulator V2 is reserved for the high-speed CAN transceiver, providing a 5 V
                       supply.
                       V2 can be activated and deactivated via the MC bits in the Mode_Control register
                       (Table 5). An undervoltage warning (a V2UI interrupt) is generated when the output
                       voltage drops below 90 % of its nominal value. The status of V2 can be read via bit V2S in
                       the WD_and_Status register (Table 4) in Normal mode (V2S = 1 in all other modes).
                       V2 can be deactivated (MC = 10) to allow the internal CAN transceiver to be supplied from
                       an external source or from V1. The alternative voltage source must be connected to pin
                       V2. All internal functions (e.g. undervoltage protection) will work normally.
                   6.7 CAN transceiver
                       The analog section of the UJA1075A CAN transceiver corresponds to that integrated into
                       the TJA1042/TJA1043. The transceiver is designed for high-speed (up to 1 Mbit/s) CAN
                       applications in the automotive industry, providing differential transmit and receive
                       capability to a CAN protocol controller.

                       and
                         • V2 is enabled and its output voltage is above its undervoltage threshold, Vuvd
                            or
                         • V2 is disabled but an external voltage source, or V1, connected to pin V2 is above its
                            undervoltage threshold (see Section 6.6.3)
                       In CAN Active mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via the CANH and
                       CANL pins. The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital
                       data which is output on pin RXDC. The transmitter converts digital data generated by a
                       CAN controller, and input on pin TXDC, to signals suitable for transmission over the bus
                       lines.
               6.7.1.2 Lowpower/Off modes
                       The CAN transceiver will be in Lowpower mode with bus wake-up detection enabled if bit
                       STBCC = 1 (see Table 6). The CAN transceiver can be woken up remotely via pins CANH
                       and CANL in Lowpower mode.
                       When the SBC is in Standby mode or Sleep mode (MC = 00 or 01), the CAN transceiver
                       will be in Off mode if bit STBCC = 0. The CAN transceiver is powered down completely in
                       Off mode to minimize quiescent current consumption.
                       A filter at the receiver input prevents unwanted wake-up events occurring due to
                       automotive transients or Electromagnetic Interference (EM)I.
                       A recessive-dominant-recessive-dominant sequence must occur on the CAN bus within
                       the wake-up time-out time (tto(wake)) to pass the wake-up filter and trigger a wake-up event
                       (see Figure 9; note that additional pulses may occur between the recessive/dominant
                       phases). The minimum recessive/dominant bus times for CAN transceiver wake-up
                       (twake(busrec)min and twake(busdom)min) must be satisfied (see Table 11).

                                                                                                High-speed CAN/LIN core system basis chip
                6.7.2 Split circuit
                       Pin SPLIT provides a DC stabilized voltage of 0.5VV2. It is activated in CAN Active mode
                       only. Pin SPLIT is floating in CAN Lowpower and Off modes. The VSPLIT circuit can be
                       used to stabilize the recessive common-mode voltage by connecting pin SPLIT to the
                       center tap of the split termination (see Figure 10).
                       A transceiver in the network that is not supplied and that generates a significant leakage
                       current from the bus lines to ground, can result in a recessive bus voltage of < 0.5VV2. In
                       this event, the split circuit will stabilize the recessive voltage at 0.5VV2. So a start of
                       transmission will not generate a step in the common-mode signal which would lead to
                       poor ElectroMagnetic Emission (EME) performance.
                                                                                             V2

               6.7.3.1 TXDC dominant time-out function
                       A TXDC dominant time-out timer is started when pin TXDC is forced LOW. If the LOW
                       state on pin TXDC persists for longer than the TXDC dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXDC),
                       the transmitter will be disabled, releasing the bus lines to recessive state. This function
                       prevents a hardware and/or software application failure from driving the bus lines to a
                       permanent dominant state (blocking all network communications). The TXDC dominant
                       time-out timer is reset when pin TXDC goes HIGH. The TXDC dominant time-out time
                       also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 10 kbit/s.
               6.7.3.2 Pull-up on TXDC pin
                       Pin TXDC has an internal pull-up towards VV1 to ensure a safe defined state in case the
                       pin is left floating.
                   6.8 LIN transceiver
                       The analog sections of the UJA1075A LIN transceiver are derived from those integrated
                       into the TJA1021. Unlike the TJA1021 however, the UJA1075A does not include an
                       internal slave termination resistor. Therefore, external termination resistors need to be
                       connected in both master and slave applications (see Figure 11 and Figure 12).

                         The transceiver is the interface between the LIN master/slave protocol controller and the
                         physical bus in a LIN. It is primarily intended for in-vehicle sub-networks using baud rates
                         from 1 kBd up to 20 kBd and is LIN 2.0/LIN 2.1/SAE J2602 compliant.

                 6.8.1 LIN operating modes
                6.8.1.1  Active mode
                         The LIN transceiver will be in Active mode when:
                           • the SBC is in Normal mode (MC = 10 or 11) and
                           • the transceiver is enabled (STBCL = 0; see Table 6) and
                           • the battery voltage (VBAT) is above the LIN undervoltage recovery threshold, Vuvr(LIN).
                         In LIN Active mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via the LIN bus pin.
                         The receiver detects data streams on the LIN bus pin (LIN) and transfers them to the
                         microcontroller via pin RXDL (see Figure 1) - LIN recessive is represented by a HIGH
                         level on RXDL, LIN dominant by a LOW level.
                         The transmit data streams of the protocol controller at the TXDL input (pin TXDL) are
                         converted by the transmitter into bus signals with optimized slew rate and wave shaping to
                         minimize EME.
                6.8.1.2  Lowpower/Off modes
                         The LIN transceiver will be in Lowpower mode with bus wake-up detection enabled if bit
                         STBCL = 1 (see Table 6). The LIN transceiver can be woken up remotely via pin LIN in
                         Lowpower mode.
                         When the SBC is in Standby mode or Sleep mode (MC = 00 or 01), the LIN transceiver
                         will be in Off mode if bit STBCL = 0. The LIN transceiver is powered down completely in
                         Off mode to minimize quiescent current consumption.
                         Filters at the receiver inputs prevent unwanted wake-up events due to automotive
                         transients or EMI.
                         The wake-up event must remain valid for at least the minimum dominant bus time for
                         wake-up of the LIN transceiver, twake(busdom)min (see Table 11).

                6.8.2 Fail-safe features
               6.8.2.1 General fail-safe features
                       The following fail-safe features have been implemented:
                         • Pin TXDL has an internal pull-up towards VV1 to guarantee a safe, defined state if this
                             pin is left floating
                         • The current of the transmitter output stage is limited in order to protect the transmitter
                             against short circuits to pin BAT
                         • A loss of power (pins BAT and GND) has no impact on the bus lines or on the
                             microcontroller. There will be no reverse currents from the bus.
               6.8.2.2 TXDL dominant time-out function
                       A TXDL dominant time-out timer circuit prevents the bus lines being driven to a permanent
                       dominant state (blocking all network communications) if TXDL is forced permanently LOW
                       by a hardware and/or software application failure. The timer is triggered by a negative
                       edge on pin TXDL. If the pin remains LOW for longer than the TXDL dominant time-out
                       time (tto(dom)TXDL), the transmitter is disabled, driving the bus lines to a recessive state.
                       The timer is reset by a positive edge on the TXDL pin.
                   6.9 Local wake-up input
                       The SBC provides 2 local wake-up pins (WAKE1 and WAKE2). The edge sensitivity
                       (falling, rising or both) of the wake-up pins can be configured independently via the WIC1
                       and WIC2 bits in the Int_Control register Table 6). These bits can also be used to disable
                       wake-up via the wake-up pins. When wake-up is enabled, a valid wake-up event on either
                       of these pins will cause a wake-up interrupt to be generated in Standby mode or Normal
                       mode. If the SBC is in Sleep mode when the wake-up event occurs, it will wake up and
                       enter Standby mode. The status of the wake-up pins can be read via the wake-up level
                       status bits (WLS1 and WLS2) in the WD_and_Status register (Table 4).
                       Note that bits WLS1 and WLS2 are only active when at least one of the wake up interrupts
                       is enabled (WIC1 ≠ 00 or WIC2 ≠ 00).

                      The sampling of the wake-up pins can be synchronized with the WBIAS signal by setting
                      bits WSE1 and WSE2 in the Int_Control register to 1 (if WSEx = 0, wake-up pins are
                      sampled continuously). The sampling will be performed on the rising edge of WBIAS (see
                      Figure 13). The sampling time, 16 ms or 64 ms, is selected via the Wake Bias Control bit
                      (WBC) in the Mode_Control register.
                      Figure 14 shows a typical circuit for implementing cyclic sampling of the wake-up inputs.

                      Pin INTN is an active-LOW, open-drain interrupt output. It is driven LOW when at least
                      one interrupt is pending. An interrupt can be cleared by writing 1 to the corresponding bit

                      clears the interrupt status bits and not the pending wake-up. The pending wake-up is
                      cleared on entering Normal mode and when the corresponding standby control bit
                      (STBCC or STBCL) is 0.
                      On devices that contain a watchdog, the CI is enabled when the watchdog switches to
                      Timeout mode while the SBC is in Standby mode or Normal mode (provided pin
                      WDOFF = LOW). A CI is generated if the watchdog overflows in Timeout mode.
                      The CI is provided to alert the microcontroller when the watchdog overflows in Timeout
                      mode. The CI will wake up the microcontroller from a μC standby mode. After polling the
                      Int_Status register, the microcontroller will be aware that the application is in cyclic wake
                      up mode. It can then perform some checks on CAN and LIN before returning to the μC
                      standby mode.
                 6.11 Temperature protection
                      The temperature of the SBC chip is monitored in Normal and Standby modes. If the
                      temperature is too high, the SBC will go to Overtemp mode, where the RSTN pin is driven
                      LOW and limp home is activated. In addition, the voltage regulators and the CAN and LIN

                   transmitters are switched off (see also Section 6.1.6 “Overtemp mode”). When the
                   temperature falls below the temperature shutdown threshold, the SBC will go to Standby
                   mode. The temperature shutdown threshold is between 165 °C and 200 °C.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 23) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 12 and 13
