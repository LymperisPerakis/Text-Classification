General Description                                                Benefits and Features
The                MAX33011E–MAX33012E,                       and  ● Integrated Protection Increases Robustness
MAX33014E–MAX33015E are a family of +5V CAN (Con-                     • ±65V Fault Tolerant CANH and CANL
trol Area Network) transceivers with integrated protection            • ±45kV ESD HBM (Human Body Model)

applications where ground planes from different systems               • 1.62V to 5.5V Logic-Supply (VL) Range
are shifting relative to each other.                                    (MAX33014E and MAX33015E)
This CAN family incorporates a fault detection feature                • Silent Mode S Disables Transmitter (MAX33011E
where it monitors the CANH and CANL line for faults like                and MAX33015E)

a fault is detected, the FAULT pin goes high, which trig-               Normal Mode (MAX33012E and MAX33014E)
gers an external interrupt with the local CAN controller,             • LPBK Enables Remote Diagnostics (MAX33014E

                                                                   Ordering Information appears at end of data sheet.
tures a variety of options to address common CAN appli-
cation requirements; low-current standby mode, slow slew
rate for improved EMI performance, silent-mode to disable
the transmitter, low level translation to interface with low
voltage controllers, and loopback mode for remote self di-
agnostics.
These devices are specified for data rates up to 5Mbps.
The transceivers include a dominant timeout to prevent
bus lockup caused by controller error or by a fault on the
TXD input. When TXD remains in the dominant state (low)
for longer than tDOM, the driver is switched to the reces-
sive state, releasing the bus.
The MAX33011E and MAX33012E are in standard 8-pin
SOIC package and the MAX33014E and MAX33015E are
in a 10-pin TDFN-EP package. The family of devices op-
erate over the -40°C to +125°C temperature range.

Detailed Description
The MAX33011E–MAX33012E and MAX33014E–MAX33015E are a family of fault protected CAN transceivers with
fault detection and fault reporting. They are designed for applications where expeditious troubleshooting is important
to increase the up time of important control systems, addressing common faults like overcurrent, overvoltage, and
transmission failure. These devices are ideal for harsh industrial applications with a number of integrated robust
protection feature set that improve the reliability of end equipment. These devices provide a link between the CAN
protocol controller and the physical wires of the bus lines in a control area network (CAN). They can be used for
DeviceNet™, CAN Kingdom, and CANOpen™ applications as well.
All CAN transceivers in the family are fault protected up to ±65V, making it suitable for applications where overvoltage
protection is required. These devices are rated up to a high ±45kV ESD of HBM (human body model), suitable for
protection during the manufacturing process, and even in the field where there is human interface for installation
and maintenance. In addition, a common mode voltage range of ±25V enables communication in noisy environments
where there are ground plane differences between different systems due to close proximity of heavy equipment
machinery or operation from different transformers. Dominant timeout prevents the bus from being blocked by a hung-up
microcontroller, and the outputs CANH and CANL are short-circuit current-limited and protected against excessive power
dissipation by thermal shutdown circuitry that places the driver outputs in a high-impedance state.
The MAX33011E–MAX33012E and MAX33014E–MAX33015E can operate up to 5Mbps. The MAX33011E and
MAX33012E have the option to slow the slew rate to 8V/μs to minimize EMI, enabling the use of unshielded-twisted or
parallel cable. The MAX33011E and MAX33012E are packaged in an industry standard 8-pin SO, while the MAX33014E
and MAX33015E are packaged in a 10-pin TDFN. The family of robust CAN transceivers have an operating temperature
from -40°C to +125°C.
±65V Fault Protection
These devices feature ±65V of fault protection. The CANH and CANL data lines are capable of withstanding a short
from -65V to +65V. This extended overvoltage range makes it suitable for applications where accidental shorts to power
supply lines are possible due to human intervention.
Transmitter
The transmitter converts a single-ended input signal (TXD) from the local CAN controller to differential outputs for the bus
lines CANH and CANL. The truth table for the transmitter and receiver is provided in Table 1.

Transmitter Output Protection
The family of CAN transceivers protect the transmitter output stage against a short-circuit to a positive or negative
voltage by limiting the driver current. See the CANH and CANL short-circuit current TOC graphs. Thermal shutdown
further protects the devices from excessive temperatures that may result from a short. The transmitter returns to normal
operation once the short is removed.
Transmitter-Dominant Timeout
The devices feature a transmitter dominant timeout (tDOM) that prevents erroneous CAN controllers from clamping the
bus to a dominant level by maintaining a continuous low TXD signal. When TXD remains in the dominant state (low)
for greater than tDOM, the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus to a recessive state (Figure 4). After a dominant
timeout fault, the transmitter is re-enabled when receiving a rising edge at TXD. The transmitter dominant timeout limits
the minimum possible data rate to 9Kbps for standard CAN protocol.
Receiver
The receiver reads the differential input from the bus line CANH and CANL and transfers this data as a single-ended
output RXD to the CAN controller. It consists of a comparator that senses the difference VDIFF = (CANH-CANL), with
respect to an internal threshold of 0.7V. If VDIFF > 0.9V, a logic-low is present on RXD. If VDIFF < 0.5V, a logic-high
is present. The CANH and CANL common-mode range is ±25V in normal mode and ±12V in standby mode. RXD is a
logic-high when CANH and CANL are shorted or terminated and undriven.
Fault Detection and Reporting
This family of devices have fault detection for overcurrent, overvoltage, and transmission failure in normal mode
operation. The detection of faults and reporting them out to the local CAN controller provide additional information
that benefits the troubleshooting of a given problem in a CAN bus system, reducing down time, improving equipment
efficiencies, and keeping service costs down.
To enable fault detection upon power-up, 100 low-to-high transitions need to pass through TXD, which is typically 1 or
2 CAN frame messages depending on data payload size (classic or extended format) and which protocol is used. Fault
detection is not enabled in standby and silent mode. After the 100 low-to-high transitions on TXD, if a fault is detected,
then another 16 low-to-high transitions on TXD are required to shift out the fault code shown in Table 2. In addition, 10
more pulses are needed to clear the fault.

Overvoltage Detection
Over voltage detection is triggered when CANH is above approximately +29V or CANL is below approximately -29V. This
indicates that the CAN bus has likely violated the CMR range or that a short fault on CANH and/or CANL has occurred

and is beyond the ±29V threshold. Once overvoltage detection is triggered, the fault pin transitions from low to high and
the fault code is clocked out of RXD through TXD.
Overcurrent Detection
Over current detection is triggered when there is a high current path from VDD to GND through a short from CANH to
CANL. In addition, shorts far away from the CAN node may not be detected due to high cable impedance. See Figure
7 for overcurrent detection maximum operating frequency versus cable length as a reference. A Cat5e copper clad
aluminum cable is used. Maximum frequency will vary with the type of cable.

Transmission Failure Detection
Transmission failure detection is triggered when the signal on RXD does not match TXD for 10 consecutive cycles after
fault detection is enabled. This can occur when both termination resistors are missing. Other scenarios include, but not
limited to, shorting CANH to GND or CANL to VDD resulting in the differential signal not meeting the receiver’s VIH and
VIL specification.

Fault Reporting
When a fault occurs and FAULT pin goes high, the CANH and CANL lines are placed in high impedance, and a 6-bit
fault code is stored in an internal register. 16 low-to-high transitions need to go through TXD to shift the fault code out
through RXD. The circuit will look for any faults and determine the fault priority-overcurrent (highest priority), overvoltage,
and then followed by transmission failure. A 6-bit fault code is shifted out of the RXD.
An overcurrent fault timing diagram is shown in Figure 8.

Fault Clear
The fault condition can be cleared only after the 6-bit fault code is reported through RXD pin of the chip. Soon after the
fault code is reported, send 10 clock pulses through the TXD pin, which will clear the fault condition, and de-asserts the
fault pin. Fault detection is disabled after fault is cleared and another 100 low-to-high transitions are required on TXD to
re-enable fault detection.
Standby Mode
Drive STBY pin high for standby mode, which switches the transmitter off and the receiver to a low current and low-
speed state. The supply current is reduced to 60μA during standby mode. The bus line is monitored by a low differential
comparator to detect and recognize a wakeup event on the bus line. Once the comparator detects a dominant bus level
longer than tWAKE, RXD is pulled low. Drive the STBY low for normal operation. Fault detection is disabled in standby
mode.
Slow Slew Rate Mode
Connect a 26.1kΩ resistor between ground and the STBY pin. This will put the device in slow slew rate mode where
the typical rising slew rate is 10V/s and the typical falling slew rate is 18V/s, enabling the use of unshielded-twisted or
parallel cable, compared with normal mode at 140V/μs falling and 180V/μs rising slew rate. The STBY pin voltage should
be between 0.1V to 0.6V to remain in slow slew rate mode.
Silent Mode
Drive S high to place the device in silent mode. This disables the transmitter regardless of the voltage level at TXD.
However, RXD is still active and monitors activity on the bus line.

Loopback Mode (MAX33014E, MAX33015E)
Drive LPBK high disables the transceiver (while keeping the CANH/CANL in recessive state), data is passed from TXD
to RXD, and enables the local CAN controller to perform self diagnostic routines without disturbing the bus. When LPBK
is connected to ground, the transceiver operates in normal mode.
Logic Compatibility (MAX33014E, MAX33015E)
A separate input VL allows the devices to communicate with logic systems down to 1.62V while operating from a +5V
supply. This provides a reduced input voltage threshold to the TXD, STBY, S, and LPBK inputs, and provides a logic-high
output at RXD compatible with the microcontroller's supply rail. The logic compatibility eliminates an external logic level
translator and longer propagation delay. Connect VL to VDD to operate with +5V logic systems.
For parts without the VL pin, the logic supply pin is VDD and all VL references can be substituted with VDD.

Applications Information
Reduced EMI and Reflections
In multidrop CAN applications, it is important to maintain a single linear bus of uniform impedance that is properly
terminated at each end. A star, ring or tree configuration should never be used. Any deviation from the end-to-end wiring
scheme creates a stub. High-speed data edges on a stub can create reflections back down to the bus. These reflections
can cause data errors by eroding the noise margin of the system. Although stubs are unavoidable in a multidrop system,
care should be taken to keep these stubs as short as possible, especially when operating with high data rates.
