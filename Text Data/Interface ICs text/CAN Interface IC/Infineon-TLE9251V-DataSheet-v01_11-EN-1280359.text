Description
Type                                  Package                                 Marking

TLE9251VSJ                            PG-DSO-8                                9251V
The TLE9251V is the latest Infineon high-speed CAN transceiver generation, used inside HS CAN networks for
automotive and also for industrial applications. It is designed to fulfill the requirements of ISO 11898-2 (2016)
physical layer specification and respectively also the SAE standards J1939 and J2284.
The TLE9251V is available in a PG-DSO-8 package and in a small, leadless PG-TSON-8 package. Both packages
are RoHS compliant and halogen free. The PG-TSON-8 package supports the solder joint requirements for
automated optical inspection (AOI).
As an interface between the physical bus layer and the HS CAN protocol controller, the TLE9251V protects the
microcontroller against interferences generated inside the network. A very high ESD robustness and the
perfect RF immunity allows the use in automotive applications without adding additional protection devices,
like suppressor diodes for example.
While the transceiver TLE9251V is not supplied the bus is switched off and illustrates an ideal passive behavior
with the lowest possible load to all other subscribers of the HS CAN network.
Based on the high symmetry of the CANH and CANL output signals, the TLE9251V provides a very low level of
electromagnetic emission (EME) within a wide frequency range. The TLE9251V fulfills even stringent EMC test
limits without additional external circuit, like a common mode choke for example.
The perfect transmitter symmetry combined with the optimized delay symmetry of the receiver enables the
TLE9251V to support CAN FD data frames. Depending on the size of the network and the along coming
parasitic effects the device supports bit rates up to 5 MBit/s.
Dedicated low-power modes, like Stand-by mode provide very low quiescent currents while the device is
powered up. In Stand-by mode the typical quiescent current on VIO is below 10 µA while the device can still be
woken up by a bus signal on the HS CAN bus.
Fail-safe features like overtemperature protection, output current limitation or the TxD time-out feature
protect the TLE9251V and the external circuitry from irreparable damage.

High-speed CAN functional description
5            High-speed CAN functional description
HS CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a
HS CAN bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within
the network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical specifications of a CAN
network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several different physical layer
standards of CAN networks have been developed in recent years. The TLE9251V is a high-speed CAN
transceiver with a dedicated bus wake-up function as defined in the latest ISO 11898-2 HS CAN standard.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
TLE9251V
High-speed CAN functional description
The TLE9251V is a high-speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates up to 5 MBit/s. The characteristic for a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus:
dominant and recessive (see Figure 3).
The CANH and CANL pins are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as an input and output. The
RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the microcontroller. The pin TxD is the serial data input from the CAN
controller, the RxD pin is the serial data output to the CAN controller. As shown in Figure 1, the HS CAN
transceiver TLE9251V includes a receiver and a transmitter unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the
bus medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver TLE9251V
converts the serial data stream which is available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output
signal on the CAN bus, provided by the CANH and CANL pins. The receiver stage of the TLE9251V monitors the
data on the CAN bus and converts them to a serial, single-ended signal on the RxD output pin. A logical “low”
signal on the TxD pin creates a dominant signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “low” signal on the RxD
pin (see Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the
CAN bus simultaneously is essential to support the bit-to-bit arbitration within CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined in ISO 11898-2. Whether a data bit is dominant or
recessive depends on the voltage difference between the CANH and CANL pins:
VDiff = VCANH - VCANL.
To transmit a dominant signal to the CAN bus the amplitude of the differential signal VDiff is higher than or
equal to 1.5 V. To receive a recessive signal from the CAN bus the amplitude of the differential VDiff is lower than
or equal to 0.5 V.
“Partially-supplied” high-speed CAN networks are those where the CAN bus nodes of one common network
have different power supply conditions. Some nodes are connected to the common power supply, while other
nodes are disconnected from the power supply and in power-down state. Regardless of whether the CAN bus
subscriber is supplied or not, each subscriber connected to the common bus media must not interfere in the
communication. The TLE9251V is designed to support “partially-supplied” networks. In power-down state,
the receiver input resistors are switched off and the transceiver input has a high resistance.
For permanently supplied ECU's, the HS CAN transceiver TLE9251V provides a Stand-by mode. In Stand-by
mode, the power consumption of the TLE9251V is optimized to a minimum, while the device is still able to
recognize wake-up patterns on the CAN bus and signal the wake-up event to the external microcontroller.
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level
at the VIO pin. Depending on the voltage level at the VIO pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (STB, TxD and
RxD) are compatible with microcontrollers having a 5 V or 3.3 V I/O supply. Usually the digital power supply VIO
of the transceiver is connected to the I/O power supply of the microcontroller (see Figure 18).

High Speed CAN Transceiver
TLE9251V
Modes of operation
6           Modes of operation
The TLE9251V supports three different modes of operation (see Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   Normal-operating mode
•   Stand-by mode
•   Forced-receive-only mode
Mode changes are either triggered by the mode selection input pin STB or by an undervoltage event on the
transmitter supply VCC. Wake-up events on the HS CAN bus are indicated on the RxD output pin in Stand-by
mode, but no mode change is triggered by a wake-up event. An undervoltage event on the digital supply VIO
powers down the TLE9251V.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
TLE9251V
Modes of operation
6.1            Normal-operating mode
In Normal-operating mode the transceiver TLE9251V sends and receives data from the HS CAN bus. All
functions are active (see also Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   The transmitter is active and drives the serial data stream on the TxD input pin to the bus pins CANH and
    CANL.
•   The normal-mode receiver is active and converts the signals from the bus to a serial data stream on the RxD
    output.
•   The low-power receiver is turned off.
•   The RxD output pin indicates the data received by the normal-mode receiver.
•   The bus biasing is connected to VCC/2.
•   The STB input pin is active and changes the mode of operation.
•   The TxD time-out function is enabled and disconnects the transmitter in case a time-out is detected.
•   The overtemperature protection is enabled and disconnects the transmitter in case an overtemperature is
    detected.
•   The undervoltage detection on VCC is enabled and triggers a mode change to Forced-receive-only in case
    an undervoltage event is detected.
•   The undervoltage detection on VIO is enabled and powers down the device in case of detection.
Normal-operating mode is entered from Stand-by mode and Forced-receive-only mode, when the STB input
pin is set to logical “low”.
Normal-operating mode can only be entered when all supplies are available:
•   The transmitter supply VCC is available (VCC > VCC(UV,R)).
•   The digital supply VIO is available (VIO > VIO(UV,R)).
6.2            Forced-receive-only mode
The Forced-receive-only mode is a fail-safe mode of the TLE9251V, which will be entered when the transmitter
supply VCC is not available and the STB pin is logical “low”. The following functions are available (see also
Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   The transmitter is disabled and the data available on the TxD input is blocked.
•   The normal-mode receiver is enabled.
•   The low-power receiver is turned off.
•   The RxD output pin indicates the data received by the normal-mode receiver.
•   The bus biasing is connected to GND.
•   The STB input pin is active and changes the mode of operation to Stand-by mode, if logical “high”.
•   The TxD time-out function is disabled.
•   The overtemperature protection is disabled.
•   The undervoltage detection on VCC is active.
•   The undervoltage detection on VIO is enabled and powers down the device in case of detection.
•   Forced-receive-only mode is entered from power-down state if the STB input pin is set to logical “low” and
    the digital supply VIO is available (VIO > VIO(UV,R)).
•   Forced-receive-only mode is entered from Normal-operating mode by an undervoltage event on the
    transmitter supply VCC.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
TLE9251V
Modes of operation
6.3          Stand-by mode
The Stand-by mode is the power save mode of the TLE9251V. In Stand-by mode most of the functions are
turned off and the TLE9251V is monitoring the bus for a valid wake-up pattern (WUP). The following functions
are available (see also Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   The transmitter is disabled and the data available on the TxD input is blocked.
•   The normal-mode receiver is disabled.
•   The low-power receiver is turned on and monitors the bus for a valid wake-up pattern (WUP).
•   The RxD output pin follows the Bus signal after WUP detection.
•   The bus biasing is connected to GND.
•   The STB input pin is active and changes the mode of operation.
•   The TxD time-out function is disabled.
•   The overtemperature protection is disabled.
•   The undervoltage detection on VCC is disabled. In Stand-by mode the device can operate without the
    transmitter supply VCC.
•   The undervoltage detection on VIO is enabled and powers down the device in case of detection.
The Stand-by mode can be entered from Normal-operating mode and Forced-receive-only mode by setting
the STB pin to logical “high”.
To enter Stand-by mode the digital supply VIO needs to be available (VIO > VCC(UV,R)).
6.4          Power-down state
Independent of the transmitter supply VCC and of the status at STB input pin the TLE9251V is powered down if
the supply voltage VIO < VIO(UV,F) (see Figure 4).
In the power-down state the differential input resistors of the receiver are switched off. The CANH and CANL
bus interface of the TLE9251V is floating and acts as a high-impedance input with a very small leakage current.
The high-ohmic input does not influence the recessive level of the CAN network and allows an optimized EME
performance of the entire HS CAN network. In power-down state the transceiver is an invisible node to the
bus.

7.1             Power-up and power-down
The HS CAN transceiver TLE9251V powers up by applying the digital supply VIO to the device (VIO > VIO(U,R)).
After powering up, the device enters one out of three operating modes (see Figure 5 and Figure 6).
Depending on the condition of the transmitter supply voltage VCC and the mode selection pin STB the device
can enter every mode of operation after the power-up:
•   VCC is available and STB input is set to “low” - Normal-operating mode
•   VCC is disabled and the STB input is set to “low” - Forced-receive-only mode
•   STB input is set to “high” - Stand-by mode
The device TLE9251V powers down when the VIO supply falls below the undervoltage detection threshold
(VIO < VIO(U,F)), regardless if the transmitter supply VCC is available or not. The power-down detection is active in
every mode of operation.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
TLE9251V
Changing the mode of operation
7.2           Mode change by the STB pin
When the TLE9251V is supplied with the digital voltage VIO the internal logic works and mode change by the
mode selection pin STB is possible.
By default the STB input pin is logical “high” due to the internal pull-up current source to VIO. Changing the STB
input pin to logical “low” in Stand-by mode triggers a mode change to Normal-operating mode (see Figure 7).
To enter Normal-operating mode the transmitter supply VCC needs to be available.
Stand-by mode can be entered from Normal-operating mode and Forced-receive-only mode by setting the
STB pin to logical “high”. While changing the mode of operation from Normal-operating mode or Forced-
receive-only mode to Stand-by mode, the transceiver TLE9251V turns off the transmitter and switches from
the normal-mode receiver to the low-power receiver. Entering Forced-receive-only mode from Stand-by
mode is not possible by the STB pin. The device remains in Stand-by mode independently of the VCC supply
voltage.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
TLE9251V
Changing the mode of operation
7.3         Mode changes by VCC undervoltage
When the transmitter supply VCC (VCC < VCC(U/F)) is in undervoltage condition, the TLE9251V might not be able to
provide the correct bus levels on the CANH and CANL output pins. To avoid any interference with the network
the TLE9251V blocks the transmitter and changes the mode of operation when an undervoltage event is
detected (see Figure 8 and Figure 9).
In Normal-operating mode an undervoltage event on transmitter supply VCC (VCC < VCC(U/F)) triggers a mode
change to Forced-receive-only mode.
In Forced-receive-only mode the undervoltage detection VCC (VCC < VCC(U/F)) is enabled. In Stand-by mode the
undervoltage detection is disabled. In these modes the TLE9251V can operate without the transmitter supply
VCC.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
TLE9251V
Changing the mode of operation
7.4            Remote wake-up
The TLE9251V has a remote wake-up feature also called bus wake-up feature according to the ISO 11898-2
(2016). In Stand-by mode the low-power receiver monitors the activity on the CAN bus and in case it detects a
wake-up pattern it indicates the wake-up signal on the RxD output pin.
The low-power receiver is supplied by the digital supply VIO and therefore in Stand-by mode the transmitter
supply VCC can be turned off.
In Stand-by mode a wake-up event on the HS CAN is flagged on the RxD output pin (see Figure 11). The
transceiver remains in the currently selected mode of operation. No mode change is applied due to the wake-
up event (see Figure 10).

Figure 10       Remote wake-up
A bus wake-up is triggered by a dedicated valid wake-up pattern. The defined wake-up pattern avoids any
false wake-up by spikes which might be on the HS CAN bus or by a permanent bus shortage.
The internal wake-up flag will be reset when:
•   A mode change to Normal-operating mode is applied during the wake-up pattern.
•   A power-down event occurs on the digital supply VIO.
Within the maximum wake-up time tWAKE, the wake-up pattern contents a dominant signal with the pulse
width tFilter, followed by a recessive signal with the pulse width tFilter and another dominant signal with the
pulse width tFilter (see Figure 11). The RxD output remains logical “high” as long no wake-up event has been
detected.

recessive signals are indicated on the RxD output as logical “high” and “low” with the delay of tWU as long their
pulse width exceeds the filter time tFilter (see also Figure 12).

Fail safe functions
8            Fail safe functions
8.1          Short circuit protection
The CANH and CANL bus pins are proven to cope with a short circuit fault against GND and against the supply
voltages. A current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device is heating up due to
a continuous short on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus
transmitter.
8.2          Unconnected logic pins
All logic input pins have an internal pull-up current source to VIO. In case the VIO and VCC supply is activated and
the logical pins are open, the TLE9251V enters into the Stand-by mode by default.
8.3          TxD time-out function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin might have its root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or in a short circuit on the printed circuit board, for example.
In Normal-operating mode, a logical “low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out
feature and the TLE9251V disables the transmitter (see Figure 13). The receiver is still active and the data on
the bus continues to be monitored by the RxD output pin.

Figure 13     TxD time-out function
Figure 13 illustrates how the transmitter is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the
TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter
after a TxD time-out event, the TLE9251V requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to
logical “high”.
8.4          Overtemperature protection
The TLE9251V has an integrated overtemperature detection to protect the TLE9251V against thermal
overstress of the transmitter. The overtemperature protection is only active in Normal-operating mode. In

case of an overtemperature condition, the temperature sensor will disable the transmitter while the
transceiver remains in Normal-operating mode. After the device has cooled down the transmitter is activated
again (see Figure 14). A hysteresis is implemented within the temperature sensor.

8.5          Delay time for mode change
The HS CAN transceiver TLE9251V changes the mode of operation within the time window tMode. During the
mode change from Stand-by mode to non-low power mode the RxD output pin is permanently set to logical
“high” and does not reflect the status on the CANH and CANL input pins.
After the mode change is completed, the transceiver TLE9251V releases the RxD output pin.
