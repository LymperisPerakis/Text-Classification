                                                            Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
6. Functional description
                           The UJA1161A is a self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver incorporating a 5 V CAN
                           supply. A variety of fail-safe and diagnostic features offer enhanced system reliability.
                    6.1 System controller
                           The system controller is a state machine that manages register configuration and controls
                           the internal functions of the UJA1161A. UJA1161A operating modes and state transitions
                           are illustrated in Figure 3. These modes are discussed in more detail in the following
                           sections.
                  6.1.1 Operating modes
                           The UJA1161A supports four operating modes: Normal, Standby, Overtemp and Off.
                6.1.1.1    Normal mode
                           Normal mode is the active operating mode. In this mode, the UJA1161A is fully
                           operational. Normal mode can be selected from Standby mode by setting pin STBN
                           HIGH, provided VIO > Vuvd(VIO). The UJA1161A exits Normal mode:
                             • if the microcontroller selects Standby mode by setting pin STBN LOW

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         UJA1161A
                                                       Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
               6.1.1.2 Standby mode
                       Standby mode is the power-saving mode of the UJA1161A, offering reduced current
                       consumption. The transceiver is unable to transmit or receive data in Standby mode.
                       The receiver monitors bus activity for a wake-up request in Standby mode. The bus pins
                       are biased at GND level (via Ri(cm)) when the bus is inactive for t > tto(silence) and at
                       approximately 2.5 V when there is activity on the bus (autonomous biasing). CAN
                       wake-up occurs via a standard wake-up pattern (see Section 6.3.2). Pin RXD is forced
                       LOW when a bus wake-up event is detected.
                       The UJA1161A switches to Standby mode:
                         • from Normal mode if pin STBN goes LOW
                         • from Normal mode if an undervoltage is detected on VIO
               6.1.1.3 Off mode
                       The UJA1161A switches to Off mode from any mode when VBAT < Vth(det)poff. Only
                       power-on detection is enabled; all other modules are inactive. The UJA1161A starts to
                       boot up when the battery voltage rises above the power-on detection threshold Vth(det)pon
                       (triggering an initialization process) and switches to Standby mode after tstartup. Pin RXD is
                       driven LOW when the UJA1161A switches from Off mode to Standby mode, to indicate a
                       power-on event has occurred.
                       In Off mode, the CAN pins disengage from the bus (zero load; high-ohmic).
               6.1.1.4 Overtemp mode
                       Overtemp mode is provided to prevent the UJA1161A being damaged by excessive
                       temperatures. The UJA1161A switches immediately to Overtemp mode from Normal or
                       Standby mode when the global chip temperature rises above the overtemperature
                       protection activation threshold, Tth(act)otp.
                       In Overtemp mode, the CAN transmitter and receiver are disabled and the CAN pins are
                       in a high-ohmic state. No wake-up event will be detected, but a pending wake-up will still
                       be signalled by a LOW level on pin RXD, which will persist after the overtemperature
                       event has been cleared. VBUF is off in Overtemp mode.
                       The UJA1161A exits Overtemp mode:
                         • and switches to Standby mode if the chip temperature falls below the overtemperature
                            protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp
                         • if the device is forced to switch to Off mode (VBAT < Vth(det)poff)

[1]   VBUF is switched on in Standby mode if a CAN wake-up pattern is detected on the bus; if pin STBN does not go HIGH within tto(silence),
      VBUF is switched off again. VBUF is also switched on in Standby mode if STBN goes HIGH to select Normal mode.
                    6.1.2 Mode control via pin STBN
                             The UJA1161A can be switched between Normal and Standby modes via the STBN
                             control input (see Figure 3). When STBN goes LOW, the UJA1161A switches to Standby
                             mode. When STBN goes HIGH, the UJA1161A switches to Normal mode.
                      6.2 Power supplies
                    6.2.1 Battery supply voltage (VBAT)
                             The internal circuitry is supplied from the battery via pin BAT. The device needs to be
                             protected against negative supply voltages, e.g. by using an external series diode. If VBAT
                             falls below the power-off detection threshold, Vth(det)poff, the UJA1161A switches to Off
                             mode, which means that the internal 5 V CAN supply and other internal logic (except for
                             power-on detection) are shut down.
                             The UJA1161A switches from Off mode to Standby mode tstartup after the battery voltage
                             rises above the power-on detection threshold, Vth(det)pon. A power-on event is indicated by
                             a LOW level on pin RXD. RXD remains LOW from the moment UJA1161A exits Off mode
                             until it switches to Normal mode.
                    6.2.2 CAN supply voltage (VBUF)
                             VBUF provides the internal CAN transceiver with a 5 V supply. The output voltage on BUF
                             is monitored. If VBUF falls below the 90 % undervoltage threshold (90 % of the nominal
                             VBUF output voltage), the CAN transceiver switches to (or remains in) Offline mode.
                      6.3 High-speed CAN transceiver
                             The integrated high-speed CAN transceiver is designed for active communication at bit
                             rates up to 1 Mbit/s, providing differential transmit and receive capability to a CAN protocol
                             controller. The transceiver is ISO 11898-2:2016 compliant. The CAN transmitter is
                             supplied from VBUF. The UJA1161A includes additional timing parameters on loop delay
                             symmetry to ensure reliable communication in fast phase at data rates up to 2 Mbit/s, as
                             used in CAN FD networks.
                             The CAN transceiver supports autonomous CAN biasing, which helps to minimize RF
                             emissions. CANH and CANL are always biased to 2.5 V when the UJA1161A is in Normal
                             mode with VBUF > 90 % threshold.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         UJA1161A
                                                       Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                       Autonomous biasing is active when the UJA1161A is in Standby mode with the CAN
                       transceiver in CAN Offline mode - to 2.5 V if there is activity on the bus (CAN Offline Bias
                       mode) and to GND if there is no activity on the bus for t > tto(silence) (CAN Offline mode).
                       This is useful when the node is disabled due to a malfunction in the microcontroller. The
                       transceiver ensures that the CAN bus is correctly biased to avoid disturbing ongoing
                       communication between other nodes. The autonomous CAN bias voltage is derived
                       directly from VBAT.
                6.3.1 CAN operating modes
                       The integrated CAN transceiver supports three operating modes: Active, Offline and
                       Offline Bias (see Figure 4). The CAN transceiver operating mode depends on the
                       UJA1161A operating mode and the output voltage on BUF.
               6.3.1.1 CAN Active mode
                       In CAN Active mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via CANH and CANL.
                       The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data, which
                       is output on pin RXD. The transmitter converts digital data generated by the CAN
                       controller (input on pin TXD) into analog signals suitable for transmission over the CANH
                       and CANL bus lines.
                       The CAN transceiver is in Active mode when:
                         • UJA1161A is in Normal mode (STBN = 1) AND VBUF > Vuvd(BUF) AND VIO > Vuvd(VIO)
                       In CAN Active mode, the CAN bias voltage is derived from VBUF. If VBUF falls below
                       Vuvd(BUF), the UJA1161A exits CAN Active mode and enters CAN Offline Bias mode with
                       autonomous CAN voltage biasing via pin BAT.
                       If pin TXD is LOW when the transceiver switches to CAN Active mode (UJA1161A in
                       Normal mode; VBUF and VIO ok), the transmitter and receiver will remain disabled until
                       TXD goes HIGH. This prevents network traffic being blocked for tto(dom)TXD (i.e. while the
                       TXD dominant time-out timer is running; see Section 6.6.1) every time the transceiver
                       enters Active mode, if the TXD pin is clamped permanently LOW.
               6.3.1.2 CAN Offline and Offline Bias modes
                       In CAN Offline mode, the transceiver monitors the CAN bus for a wake-up event. CANH
                       and CANL are biased to GND.
                       CAN Offline Bias mode is the same as CAN Offline mode, with the exception that the CAN
                       bus is biased to 2.5 V. This mode is activated automatically when activity is detected on
                       the CAN bus while the transceiver is in CAN Offline mode. The transceiver will return to
                       CAN Offline mode if the CAN bus is silent (no CAN bus edges) for longer than tto(silence).
                       The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline mode from CAN Active mode when:
                         • theUJA1161A switches to Standby mode
                       provided the CAN-bus has been inactive for at least tto(silence). If the CAN-bus has been
                       inactive for less than tto(silence), the CAN transceiver switches first to CAN Offline Bias
                       mode and then to CAN Offline mode once the bus has been silent for tto(silence).
                       The CAN transceiver will switch from CAN Active mode to CAN Offline Bias mode if:

                                                                 Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                 6.3.1.3    CAN Off mode
                            The CAN transceiver is switched off completely with the bus lines floating when:
                               • the UJA1161A switches to Off or Overtemp mode OR
                               • VBAT falls below the CAN receiver undervoltage detection threshold, Vuvd(CAN)
                            It will be switched on again on entering CAN Offline mode when VBAT rises above the
                            undervoltage recovery threshold (Vuvr(CAN)) and the UJA1161A is no longer in
                            Off/Overtemp mode. CAN Off mode prevents reverse currents flowing from the bus when
                            the battery supply to the UJA1161A is lost.
                   6.3.2 CAN standard wake-up
                            The UJA1161A monitors the bus for a wake-up pattern when the CAN transceiver is in
                            Offline mode.
                            A filter at the receiver input prevents unwanted wake-up events occurring due to
                            automotive transients or EMI. A dominant-recessive-dominant wake-up pattern must be
                            transmitted on the CAN bus within the wake-up timeout time (tto(wake)) to pass the wake-up
                            filter and trigger a wake-up event (see Figure 5; note that additional pulses may occur
                            between the recessive/dominant phases). The recessive and dominant phases must last
                            at least twake(busrec) and twake(busdom), respectively.
                            Pin RXD is driven LOW when a valid CAN wake-up pattern is detected on the bus.

                      6.4 VIO supply pin
                            Pin VIO should be connected to the microcontroller supply voltage. This will cause the
                            signal levels on TXD, RXD, STBN and CTS to be adjusted to the I/O levels of the
                            microcontroller, enabling direct interfacing without the need for glue logic.
                      6.5 CAN transceiver status pin (CTS)
                            Pin CTS is driven HIGH to indicate to microcontroller that the transceiver is fully enabled
                            and data can be transmitted and received via the TXD/RXD pins.
                            Pin CTS is actively driven LOW:
                               • while the transceiver is starting up (e.g. during a transition from Standby to Normal
                                  mode) or

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         UJA1161A
                                                       Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                         • if pin TXD is clamped LOW for t > tto(dom)TXD or
                         • if an undervoltage is detected on VIO or BUF
                   6.6 CAN fail-safe features
                6.6.1 TXD dominant timeout
                       A TXD dominant time-out timer is started when pin TXD is forced LOW while the
                       transceiver is in CAN Active Mode. If the LOW state on pin TXD persists for longer than
                       the TXD dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                       lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                       failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                       traffic). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD goes HIGH. The TXD
                       dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 4.4 kbit/s.
                6.6.2 Pull-up on TXD pin
                       Pin TXD has an internal pull-up (towards VIO) to ensure a safe defined recessive driver
                       state in case the pin is left floating.
                6.6.3 Pull-down on STBN pin
                       Pin STBN has an internal pull-down (to GND) to ensure the UJA1161A switches to
                       Standby mode if STBN is left floating.
                6.6.4 Loss of power at pin BAT
                       A loss of power at pin BAT has no impact on the bus lines or on the microcontroller. No
                       reverse currents flow from the bus.

         (2) For bus line end nodes, RT = 60  in order to support the ‘split termination concept’. For sub-nodes, an optional ‘weak’
             termination of e.g. RT = 1.3 k can be used, if required by the OEM.

                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 13) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
