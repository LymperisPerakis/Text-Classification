                  Dual high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                  Rev. 4 — 15 January 2018                                             Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1059 is a dual high-speed CAN transceiver that provides an interface between a
              Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical two-wire CAN-bus.
              The transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the automotive and truck
              industries. It provides differential transmit and receive capabilities to (a microcontroller
              with) a CAN protocol controller.
              The TJA1059 belongs to the third generation of high-speed CAN transceivers from NXP
              Semiconductors, offering significant improvements over first- and second-generation
              devices such as the TJA1040. It offers improved Electro Magnetic Compatibility (EMC)
              and ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) performance, and also features:
                •  Ideal passive behavior to the CAN-bus when the supply voltage is off
                •  A very low-current Standby mode with bus wake-up capability on both channels
                •  Can be interfaced directly to microcontrollers with supply voltages from 3 V to 5 V
                •  Complies with global OEM requirements, allowing a one-fits-all approach
              The TJA1059 implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. This implementation enables reliable communication in the
              CAN FD fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
              These features make the TJA1059 an excellent choice for all types of HS-CAN networks
              containing more than one HS-CAN interface requiring a low-power mode with wake-up
              capability via the CAN-bus, especially for Body Control and Gateway units.

7. Functional description
                       The TJA1059 is a dual HS-CAN stand-alone transceiver with Standby mode and robust
                       ESD handling capability. It combines the functionality of two TJA1040/TJA1049
                       transceivers with improved EMC and quiescent current performance. Improved slope
                       control and high DC handling capability on the bus pins provide additional application
                       flexibility.
                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1059 supports two operating modes per transceiver, Normal and Standby. The
                       operating mode can be selected independently for each transceiver via pins STB1 and
                       STB2 (see Table 4).

                                                                               LOW                                  HIGH
                        Normal         LOW                                     bus dominant                         bus recessive
                        Standby        HIGH                                    wake-up request detected             no wake-up request detected
                7.1.1 Normal mode
                       A LOW level on pin STB1/STB2 selects Normal mode. In this mode, the transceiver can
                       transmit and receive data via the bus lines CANH1/CANL1 and CANH2/CANL2 (see
                       Figure 1 for the block diagram). The differential receiver converts the analog data on the
                       bus lines into digital data which is output on pin RXD1/RXD2. The slopes of the output
                       signals on the bus lines are controlled internally and are optimized in a way that
                       guarantees the lowest possible EME.
                7.1.2 Standby mode
                       A HIGH level on pin STB1/STB2 selects Standby mode. In Standby mode, the transceiver
                       is not able to transmit or correctly receive data via the bus lines. The transmitter and
                       Normal-mode receiver blocks are switched off to reduce supply current, and only a
                       low-power differential receiver monitors the bus lines for activity.
                       In Standby mode, the bus lines are biased to ground to minimize the system supply
                       current. The low-power receiver is supplied by VIO and can detect CAN-bus activity even if
                       VIO is the only supply voltage available. When pin RXD1/RXD2 goes LOW to signal a
                       wake-up request, a transition to Normal mode is not triggered until STB1/STB2 is forced
                       LOW.
                   7.2 Remote wake-up (via the CAN-bus)
                       The CAN transceivers contain separate wake-up circuits that operate independently of
                       each other. When a dedicated wake-up pattern (specified in ISO11898-5: 2007) is
                       detected on the bus, the associated transceiver wakes up from Standby mode. This
                       filtering helps avoid spurious wake-up events. A spurious wake-up sequence could be
                       triggered by, for example, a dominant clamped bus or by dominant phases generated by
                       noise or spikes on the bus.
                       The wake-up pattern consists of:

                                • a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom)
                             Dominant or recessive bits inserted between these phases that are shorter than
                             twake(busdom) and twake(busrec), respectively, are ignored
                             The complete dominant-recessive-dominant pattern must be received within tto(wake)bus to
                             be recognized as a valid wake-up pattern (see Figure 3). Otherwise, the internal wake-up
                             logic is reset. The complete wake-up pattern will then need to be retransmitted to trigger a
                             wake-up event. Pin RXDx remains HIGH until the wake-up event has been triggered.
                             After a wake-up sequence has been detected, the transceiver will remain in Standby
                             mode with the bus signals reflected on RXDx. Note that dominant or recessive phases
                             lasting less than tfltr(wake)bus will not be detected by the low-power differential receiver and
                             will not be reflected on RXDx in Standby mode.
                             A wake-up event is not flagged on RXDx if any of the following events occurs while a valid
                             wake-up pattern is being received:

                                • a VIO undervoltage is detected (VIO < Vuvd(VIO); see Section 7.3.3)

                             trigger a wake-up event.

                             A 'TXD dominant time-out' timer is started when pin TXD1/TXD2 is set LOW. If the LOW
                             state on this pin persists for longer than tto(dom)TXD, the transmitter is disabled, releasing
                             the bus lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software
                             application failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all

                                                                           Dual high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                       network communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin
                       TXD1/TXD2 is set HIGH. The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum
                       possible bit rate of 40 kbit/s. The TJA1059 has two TXD dominant time-out timers that
                       operate independently of each other.
                7.3.2 Internal biasing of TXD1, TXD2, STB1 and STB2 input pins
                       Pins TXD1, TXD2, STB1 and STB2 have internal pull-ups to VIO. The pull-ups ensure a
                       safe, defined state if any of these pins are left floating. Pins GNDA and GNDB must be
                       connected together in the application.
                       Pull-up currents flow in these pins in all states. Pins TXD1, TXD2, STB1 and STB2 should
                       be held HIGH in Standby mode to minimize the supply current.
                7.3.3 Undervoltage detection on pins VCC and VIO
                       Should VCC drop below the VCC undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(VCC), both transceivers
                       will switch to Standby mode. The logic state of pins STB1 and STB2 is ignored until VCC
                       has recovered.
                       Should VIO drop below the VIO undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(VIO), the transceivers will
                       switch off and disengage from the bus (zero load) until VIO has recovered.
                7.3.4 Overtemperature protection
                       The output drivers are protected against overtemperature conditions. If the virtual junction
                       temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), both output drivers are
                       disabled. When the virtual junction temperature drops below Tj(sd) again, the output
                       drivers will recover independently once TXD1/TXD2 have been reset to HIGH. Including
                       the TXD1/TXD2 condition prevents output driver oscillation due to small variations in
                       temperature.
                   7.4 VIO supply pin
                       Pin VIO should be connected to the microcontroller supply voltage (see Figure 6). This
                       adjusts the signal levels of pins TXD1, TXD2, RXD1, RXD2, STB1 and STB2 to the I/O
                       levels of the microcontroller. Pin VIO also provides the internal supply voltage for the
                       low-power differential receiver of the transceiver. It allows applications running in
                       low-power mode to monitor the bus lines for activity, even if there is no supply voltage on
                       pin VCC.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                                                                          Dual high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 10) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 10.
