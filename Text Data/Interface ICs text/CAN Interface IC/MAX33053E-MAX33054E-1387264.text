other factors. These transceivers include a dominant
timeout to prevent bus lockup caused by controller error
or by a fault on the TXD input. When TXD remains in the
dominant state (low) for longer than TDOM, the driver is
switched to the recessive state, releasing the bus. The
MAX33053E features an S pin where it enables and
disables the transmitter for applications where you need
the transceiver to receive only. The MAX33054E features
a STBY pin for 3 modes of operation; standby mode for
low-current consumption, normal high-speed mode, or
a slow slew rate mode when an external 26.1kΩ is
connected between ground and STBY pin.
The MAX33053E and MAX33054E are available in a
standard 8-pin SOIC package and operate over the -40°C
to +125°C temperature range.
