NCV7351, NCV7351F
High Speed CAN, CAN FD
Transceiver
   The NCV7351 CAN transceiver is the interface between a
controller area network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical
bus and may be used in both 12 V and 24 V systems. The transceiver
provides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential                      www.onsemi.com
receive capability to the CAN controller.
   The NCV7351 is an addition to the CAN high−speed transceiver
family complementing NCV734x CAN stand−alone transceivers and                                         MARKING DIAGRAM
