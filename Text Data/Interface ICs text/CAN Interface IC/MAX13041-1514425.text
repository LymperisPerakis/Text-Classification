 Edge on WAKE
Note 1: Positive current flows into the device.
Note 2: Limits over the operating temperature range are tested at worst-case supply voltage and compliant over the complete voltage
        range.
Note 3: Current measured at +20V and guaranteed by design up to +40V.
Note 4: Common-mode voltage range ±40V.
Note 5: A remote wake-on CAN request is generated upon the detection of two dominant bus cycles, each followed by a recessive
        bus cycle.
