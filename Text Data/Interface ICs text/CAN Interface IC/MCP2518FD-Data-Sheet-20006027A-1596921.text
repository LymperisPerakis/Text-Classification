Note 1:     The TBC will be stopped and reset when TBCEN = 0.
       2:   The TBC prescaler count will be reset on any write to CiTBC (CiTSCON.TBCPRE will be unaffected).

3.3.1        RAM ECC
                                                                        DP<38:0> DE<38:0>
The RAM is protected with an Error Correction Code
(ECC). The ECC logic supports Single Error
                                                                                             ECCCON.ECCEN
Correction (SEC), and Double Error Detection (DED).
SEC/DED requires seven parity bits in addition to the                          DR<38:0>
32 data bits.
Figure 3-3 shows the block diagram of the ECC logic.                      RAM 512x(32+7)
                                                                               QR<38:0>
3.3.1.1        ECC Enable and Disable
The ECC logic can be enabled by setting
                                                                   QR<31:0>                      ECCSTAT.SECIF
ECCCON.ECCEN. When ECC is enabled, the data                                             Decoder
                                                                 without Parity                  ECCSTAT.DEDIF
written to the RAM is encoded, and the data read from
RAM is decoded.
                                                                        D<31:0>       DO<31:0>
When the ECC logic is disabled, the data is written to
RAM, the parity bits are taken from ECCCON.PARITY.
                                                                                             ECCCON.ECCEN
This enables the testing of the ECC logic by the user.
During a read the parity bits are stripped out and the                          Q<31:0>
data is read back unchanged.
3.3.1.2        RAM Write                                                      Read Data
During a RAM write, the Encoder calculates the parity
bits and adds the parity bits to the input data.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•      Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•      Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
•      There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•      Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•      Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
