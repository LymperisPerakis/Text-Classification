1.7.3        SUPPLY VOLTAGE PIN (VDD)
Positive supply voltage pin. Supplies transmitter and
receiver, including the wake-up receiver.
1.7.4        RECEIVER DATA 
             OUTPUT PIN (RXD)
RXD is a CMOS-compatible output that drives High or
Low depending on the differential signals on the CANH
and CANL pins, and is usually connected to the
receiver data input of the CAN controller device. RXD is
High when the CAN bus is Recessive, and Low in the
Dominant state. RXD is supplied by VDD or VIO, in the
MCP2561 or MCP2562, respectively.
1.7.5        SPLIT PIN (MCP2561 ONLY)
Reference Voltage Output (defined as VDD/2). The pin
is only active in Normal mode. In Standby mode, or
when VDD is off, SPLIT floats.
1.7.6        VIO PIN (MCP2562 ONLY)
Supply for digital I/O pins. In the MCP2561, the supply
for the digital I/O (TXD, RXD and STBY) is internally
connected to VDD.
1.7.7        CAN LOW PIN (CANL)
The CANL output drives the Low side of the CAN
differential bus. This pin is also tied internally to the
receive input comparator. CANL disconnects from the
bus when MCP2561/2 is not powered.
1.7.8        CAN HIGH PIN (CANH)
The CANH output drives the high-side of the CAN
differential bus. This pin is also tied internally to the
receive input comparator. CANH disconnects from the
bus when MCP2561/2 is not powered.

The following is the list of modifications:
1.   Added references to ISO-11898-2 throughout
     the document.
2.   Updated Section 1.1.2 “Standby Mode”.
     Described transition from Standby to Normal
     mode. Emphasized that wake-up on CAN bus
     requires both VDD and VIO.
3.   Explained that POR and Brown-out are limited
     to VDD pin in Section 1.6 “Power-On Reset
     (POR) and Undervoltage Detection”.
4.   Updated Section 2.2 “DC Characteristics”.
     Clarified RL, added CANH/CANL Short Circuit
     specification for 5V and room temperature.
5.   Minor typographical corrections.
Revision B (March 2013)

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
