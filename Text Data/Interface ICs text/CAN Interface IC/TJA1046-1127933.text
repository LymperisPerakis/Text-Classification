                  Rev. 3 — 6 September 2017                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1046 is a dual high-speed CAN transceiver that provides two interfaces between
              a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical two-wire CAN-bus. It
              is composed of two fully independent TJA1044GT transceivers. The transceivers are
              designed for high-speed CAN applications in the automotive industry, providing the
              differential transmit and receive capability to (a microcontroller with) a CAN protocol
              controller. The TJA1046 guarantees robust communication at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s as
              used in, for example, CAN FD networks
              The TJA1046 offers a feature set optimized for 12 V automotive applications and excellent
              ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance.
               Additionally, the TJA1046 features:
                • Ideal passive behavior to the CAN-bus when the supply voltage is off
                • A very low-current Standby mode with bus wake-up capability
                • Excellent EMC performance at speeds up to 500 kbit/s, even without a common mode
                   choke
              The HVSON package allows for more than 70 % PCB space saving compared with
              traditional SO packages. These features make the TJA1046 an excellent choice for
              networks containing more than one HS-CAN interface requiring a low-power mode with
              wake-up capability via the CAN-bus, especially for body and gateway control units.
              The TJA1046 implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. Additional timing parameters defining loop delay symmetry
              are specified. This implementation enables reliable communication in the CAN FD fast
              phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.

                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1046 supports two operating modes per transceiver, Normal and Standby. The
                       operating mode is selected independently for each transceiver via pins STB1 and STB2.
                       See Table 4 for a description of the operating modes under normal supply conditions.

                       [1]   ‘x’ = don’t care
                7.1.1 Normal mode
                       A LOW level on pin STBx selects Normal mode. In this mode, the enabled transceiver can
                       transmit and receive data via the bus lines CANHx and CANLx (see Figure 1 for the block
                       diagram). The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital
                       data which is output on pin RXDx. The slopes of the output signals on the bus lines are
                       controlled internally and are optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible EME.
                7.1.2 Standby mode
                       A HIGH level on pin STBx selects Standby mode. In Standby mode, the enabled
                       transceiver cannot transmit or correctly receive data via the bus lines. The transmitter and
                       Normal-mode receiver blocks are switched off to reduce supply current, and only a
                       low-power differential receiver monitors the bus lines for activity.
                       In Standby mode, the bus lines are biased to ground to minimize the system supply
                       current. The low-power receiver is supplied from VCCX and is able to detect CAN-bus
                       activity. Pin RXDx follows the bus after a wake-up request has been detected. A transition
                       to Normal mode is triggered when STBx is forced LOW.
                   7.2 Remote wake-up (via the CAN-bus)
                       The CAN transceivers contain separate wake-up circuits that operate independently of
                       each other. When a dedicated wake-up pattern (specified in ISO 11898-2: 2016) is
                       detected on the bus, the associated transceiver wakes up from Standby mode. This
                       filtering helps avoid spurious wake-up events. A spurious wake-up sequence could be
                       triggered by, for example, a dominant clamped bus or by dominant phases generated by
                       noise or spikes on the bus.
                       The wake-up pattern consists of:
                          • a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom) followed by
                          • a recessive phase of at least twake(busrec) followed by

                                • a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom)
                             Dominant or recessive bits inserted between these phases that are shorter than
                             twake(busdom) and twake(busrec), respectively, are ignored
                             The complete dominant-recessive-dominant pattern must be received within tto(wake)bus to
                             be recognized as a valid wake-up pattern (see Figure 3). Otherwise, the internal wake-up
                             logic is reset. The complete wake-up pattern will then need to be retransmitted to trigger a
                             wake-up event. Pin RXDx remains HIGH until the wake-up event has been triggered.
                             After a wake-up sequence has been detected, the transceiver will remain in Standby
                             mode with the bus signals reflected on RXDx. Note that dominant or recessive phases
                             lasting less than tfltr(wake)bus will not be detected by the low-power differential receiver and
                             will not be reflected on RXDx in Standby mode.
                             A wake-up event is not flagged on RXDx if any of the following events occurs while a valid
                             wake-up pattern is being received:
                                • The transceiver switches to Normal mode
                                • The complete wake-up pattern was not received within tto(wake)bus
                                • A VCC undervoltage is detected (VCC < Vuvd(stb); see Section 7.3.3)
                             If any of these events occur while a wake sequence is being received, the internal
                             wake-up logic is reset. The complete wake-up sequence will then need to be
                             retransmitted to trigger a wake-up event.

                   7.3.1 TXD dominant time-out function
                             A 'TXD dominant time-out' timer is started when pin TXDx goes LOW. If the LOW state on
                             this pin persists for longer than tto(dom)TXD, the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                             lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                             failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                             communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXDx is set HIGH.

                                                                           Dual high-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                      The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of
                      approximately 25 kbit/s. Each of the transceivers in the TJA1046 has its own TXD
                      dominant time-out timer. The two timers operate independently of each other.
                7.3.2 Internal biasing of TXDx and STBx input pins
                      Pins TXDx and STBx have internal pull-ups to VCCx to ensure a safe, defined state in case
                      they are left floating. Pull-up currents flow in these pins in all states; both pins should be
                      held HIGH in Standby mode to minimize supply current.
                7.3.3 Undervoltage detection on pins VCCx
                      The TJA1046 features two fully independent supply voltages. If VCCx drops below the
                      standby undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(stb), the transceiver switches to Standby mode.
                      The logic state of pin STBx is ignored until VCCx has recovered. A LOW level on TXDx is
                      also ignored. This precaution prevents the bus being driven dominant while VCCx is
                      recovering. TXDx will continue to be ignored until a HIGH level (bus recessive) is
                      detected.
                      If VCCx drops below the switch-off undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(swoff), the transceiver
                      switches off and disengages from the bus (zero load; bus pins floating) until VCCx has
                      recovered.
                      Each of the transceivers in the TJA1046 has its own undervoltage protection circuit. The
                      two circuits operate independently of each other.

                      The output drivers are protected against overtemperature conditions. If the virtual junction
                      temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), both output drivers are
                      disabled. When the virtual junction temperature drops below Tj(sd) again, the output
                      drivers recover independently once TXDx has been reset to HIGH. Including the TXDx
                      condition prevents output driver oscillation due to small variations in temperature. Each of
                      the transceivers in the TJA1046 has its own temperature protection circuit. The two
                      circuits operate independently of each other.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 10) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 10.
