System Basis Chip with
CAN, LIN, HS & LS Drivers
NCV7462
  The NCV7462 is a monolithic LIN/CAN System−Basis−Chip with
enhanced feature set useful in Automotive Body Control systems.
Besides the bus interfaces the IC features two 5 V voltage regulators,
high−side and low−side switches to control LED’s and relays, and                             www.onsemi.com
supervision functionality like a window watchdog. This allows a
highly integrated solution by replacing external discrete components
while maintaining the system flexibility. As a consequence, the board
space and ECU weight can be minimized.
