  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

6                VIO         iCoupler Power Supply. It is recommended that a 0.1 μF and a 0.01 μF decoupling capacitor be fitted
                             between Pin 6 and GND1. See Figure 28 for layout recommendations.
8                VCC         isoPower Power Supply. It is recommended that a 0.1 μF and a 10 μF decoupling capacitor be fitted
                             between Pin 8 and Pin 9.
11, 13           GND2        Ground for Isolated DC-to-DC Converter. It is recommended to connect Pin 11 and Pin 13 together through
                             one ferrite bead to the PCB ground.
12               VISOOUT     Isolated Power Supply Output. This pin must be connected externally to VISOIN. It is recommended that a ferrite
                             bead reservoir capacitor of 10 μF and a decoupling capacitor of 0.1 μF be fitted between Pin 12 and Pin 11.
14               VREF        Reference Voltage Output. It is recommended not to connect to this pin.
15               CANL        Low-Level CAN Voltage Input/Output.
16, 20           GND2        Ground, Bus Side.
17               CANH        High-Level CAN Voltage Input/Output.
18               RS          Slope Control Pin. Short this pin to GND2 (Pin 16 or Pin 20) for full speed operation. Use a weak pull-down for
                             slope control. An input high places the transceiver in standby. This pin must not be left floating.
19               VISOIN      Isolated Power Supply Input. This pin must be connected externally to VISOOUT. It is recommended this pin
                             have a 0.1 μF capacitor to GND2 (Pin13 or Pin 11). Connect this pin through a ferrite bead and short trace
                             length to VISOIN for operation.

side of the barrier to the other.                                                                                                    1

Digital inputs are encoded into waveforms that are capable of
exciting the primary transformer winding. At the secondary                                                                       0.1

value that was originally transmitted.                                                                                     0.01
Positive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause
narrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer.

The insulation lifetime of the ADM3053 depends on the voltage
waveform type imposed across the isolation barrier. The iCoupler
insulation structure degrades at different rates, depending on
whether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 29,
Figure 30, and Figure 31 illustrate these different isolation voltage
waveforms.
