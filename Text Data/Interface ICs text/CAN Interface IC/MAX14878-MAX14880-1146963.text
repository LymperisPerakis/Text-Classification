General Description                                         Benefits and Features
The MAX14878–MAX14880 family of high-speed                  ●● Integrated Protection for Robust Communication
transceivers improve communication and safety by               • 2.75kVRMS, 3.5kVRMS, or 5kVRMS Withstand
integrating galvanic isolation between the CAN protocol           Isolation Voltage for 60s (Galvanic Isolation)
controller side of the device and the physical wires of the    • ±25V Receiver Input Common-Mode Range
network (CAN) bus. Isolation improves communication by         • ±54V Fault Protection on Receiver Inputs
breaking ground loops and reduces noise where there are     ●● High-Performance Transceiver Enables Flexible Designs
large differences in ground potential between ports. The       • Wide 1.71V to 5.5V Supply for the CAN Controller
MAX14879 provides up to 2750VRMS (60s) of galvanic                Interface
isolation, while the MAX14878/MAX14880 provide up to           • Available 16-pin and 8-pin SOIC Package Pin
5000VRMS (60s) of galvanic isolation in 16-pin SOIC and           Configurations
3500VRMS(60s) in 8-pin SOIC.                                   • Data Rates up to 1Mbps (Max)
All transceivers operate up to the maximum high-speed          • Dominant Timeout Protection
CAN data rate of 1Mbps. The MAX14879/MAX14880
                                                            Safety Regulatory Approvals
feature an integrated standby input (STB) on the isolated
side of the transceiver to disable the driver and place the ●● UL According to UL1577 (Basic Insulation) (16-Pin
transceiver in a low-power standby mode. The MAX14878          Package Devices Only)
does not include the standby input.
The MAX14878–MAX14880 transceivers feature integrated
protection for robust communication. The receiver input
common-mode range is ±25V, exceeding the ISO 11898
specification of -2V to +7V, and are fault tolerant up to   Ordering Information appears at end of data sheet.
±54V. Driver outputs/receiver inputs are also protected
from ±15kV electrostatic discharge (ESD) to GNDB on the
bus side, as specified by the Human Body Model (HBM).
Interfacing with CAN protocol controllers is simplified by
the wide 1.71V to 5.5V supply voltage range (VDDA) on
the controller side of the device. This supply voltage sets
the interface logic levels between the transceiver and
controller. The supply voltage range for the CAN bus side
of the device is 4.5V to 5.5V (VDDB).
The MAX14878–MAX14880 are available in a wide-body
16-pin SOIC package with 8mm of creepage and clearance.
The MAX14878 is also available in an 8-pin wide-body SOIC
package. These devices operate over the -40°C to +125°C
temperature range.

Note 1: All devices 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages referenced to their
          respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: Not production tested. Guaranteed at TA = +25°C.
Note 4: The dominant timeout feature releases the bus when TX is held low longer than tDO. CAN protocol guarantees a maximum
          of 11 successive dominant bits in any transmission. The minimum data rate allowed by the dominant timeout, then, is 11/
          tDO(min).
Note 5: All 16-pin package devices are 100% production tested for high voltage conditions (this does not apply to the 8-pin
          MAX14878AWA).
