TLE6251D
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with bus wake-up
high symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE6251D provides a very low level of electromagnetic
emission (EME) within a wide frequency range. The TLE6251D is integrated into a RoHS compliant PG-DSO-8
package and fulfills or exceeds the requirements of the ISO11898-2 / -5.
The TLE6251D allows very low quiescent currents in stand-by mode while the device is still able to wake-up by
a bus signal on the CAN bus. Based on the very low leakage currents on the CAN bus interface the TLE6251D
provides an excellent passive behavior in power-down state. These and other features make the TLE6251D
especially suitable for mixed supply CAN networks.
Based on the Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT, the TLE6251D provides excellent ESD immunity together
with a very high electromagnetic immunity (EMI). The TLE6251D and the Infineon SPT technology are AEC
qualified and tailored to withstand the harsh conditions of the Automotive Environment.
Two different operation modes, additional fail-safe features like a TxD time-out, and the optimized output
slew rates on the CANH and CANL signals make the TLE6251D the ideal choice for large CAN networks with high
data transmission rates.

TLE6251D
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with bus wake-up
Functional description
3            Functional description
CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model, the physical layer of a CAN
bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within the
network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical
specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several
different physical layer standards of CAN networks have been developed in recent years. The TLE6251D is a
High Speed CAN transceiver with a dedicated bus wake-up function and defined by the international standard
ISO 11898-2.

TLE6251D
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with bus wake-up
Functional description
The TLE6251D is a High Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two-wire, differential network, which allows data transmission
rates up to 1 Mbps. The characteristics for a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus:
dominant and recessive (see Figure 3).
The CANH and CANL pins are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as an input and output. The
RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the microcontroller. The TxD pin is the serial data input from the CAN
controller, the RxD pin is the serial data output to the CAN controller. As shown in Figure 1, the HS CAN
transceiver TLE6251D includes a receiver and a transmitter unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the
bus medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D
converts the serial data stream which is available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output
signal on the CAN bus, provided by the pins CANH and CANL. The receiver stage of the TLE6251D monitors the
data on the CAN bus and converts them to a serial, single-ended signal on the RxD output pin. A logical “low”
signal on the TxD pin creates a dominant signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “low” signal on the RxD
pin (see Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the
CAN bus simultaneously is essential to support the bit-to-bit arbitration within CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined by the ISO 11898-2 and the ISO 11898-5 standards.
Whether a data bit is dominant or recessive depends on the voltage difference between the CANH and CANL
pins: VDIFF = VCANH - VCANL.
In comparison with other differential network protocols, the amplitude of the differential signal on a CAN
network can only be higher than or equal to 0 V. To transmit a dominant signal to the CAN bus, the amplitude
of the differential signal VDIFF is higher than or equal to 1.5 V. To receive a recessive signal from the CAN bus,
the amplitude of the differential VDIFF is lower than or equal to 0.5 V.
“Partially-supplied” High Speed CAN networks are networks in which the CAN bus nodes of one common
network have different power supply conditions. Some nodes are connected to the common power supply,
while other nodes are disconnected from the power supply and in power-down state. Regardless of whether
the CAN bus subscriber is supplied or not, each subscriber connected to the common bus media must not
interfere with the communication. The TLE6251D is designed to support “partially-supplied” networks. In the
power-down state, the receiver input resistors are switched off and the transceiver input has a high resistance.
For permanently supplied ECUs, the HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D provides a stand-by mode. In stand-by
mode, the power consumption of the TLE6251D is optimized to a minimum, while the device is still able to
recognize wake-up patterns on the CAN bus and signal a wake-up event to the external microcontroller.
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level
at the VIO pin. Depending on the voltage level at the VIO pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (STB, TxD and
RxD) are compatible with microcontrollers having a 5 V or 3.3 V I/O supply. Usually, the VIO power supply of the
transceiver is connected to the same power supply as the I/O power supply of the microcontroller.
3.2            Modes of operation
Two different modes of operation are available on the TLE6251D. Each mode has specific characteristics in
terms of quiescent current or data transmission. The digital input pin STB is used for the mode selection.
Figure 4 illustrates the different mode changes depending on the status of the STB pin. After supplying VCC and
VIO to the HS CAN transceiver, the TLE6251D starts in stand-by mode. The internal pull-up resistor at the STB
pin sets the TLE6251D to stand-by mode by default. If the microcontroller is up and running, the TLE6251D can
switch to any operating mode within the time period for mode change tMODE.

TLE6251D
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with bus wake-up
Functional description
3.3           Normal-operating mode
In the normal-operating mode, the HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D sends the serial data stream on the TxD pin
to the CAN bus. The data on the CAN bus is displayed at the RxD pin simultaneously. In normal-operating
mode, all functions of the TLE6251D are active:
•   The transmitter is active and drives data from the TxD to the CAN bus.
•   The receiver is active and provides the data from the CAN bus to the RxD pin.
•   The low-power receiver is disabled.
•   The bus basing is set to VCC/2.
•   The undervoltage monitoring on the power supply VCC and on the power supply VIO is active.
•   The overtemperature protection is active.
To enter the normal-operating mode, set the STB pin to logical “low” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The STB pin
has an internal pull-up resistor to the power-supply VIO.
3.4           Stand-by mode
Stand-by mode is an idle mode of the TLE6251D with optimized power consumption. In stand-by mode, the
TLE6251D can not send or receive any data. The normal mode receiver is switched off and only the low-power
receiver is active. An additional filter, implemented inside the low-power receiver ensures that only dominant
and recessive signals on the CAN bus, which are longer than the bus wake-up time tWU are indicated at the RxD
output pin.
•   The transmitter is disabled, and permanently recessive.
•   The input TxD is disabled.
•   The normal mode receiver is disabled.
•   The low-power receiver is active.
•   The RxD output is “high”, in case no wake-up signal on the CAN bus is detected (see Figure 5).
•   The RxD output toggles according to the wake-up signal on the CAN bus (see Figure 5).
•   The undervoltage monitoring on the power supply VCC is disabled.
•   The undervoltage monitoring on the power supply VIO is active.
•   The bus biasing is set to GND.
•   The overtemperature protection is not active.
To enter the stand-by mode, set the pin STB to logical “high” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The STB pin has an
internal pull-up resistor to the power-supply VIO. In case the stand-by mode is not be used in the final
application, the STB pin needs to get connected to GND.
3.5           Power-down state
The power-down state means that the TLE6251D is not supplied. In the power-down state, the differential
input resistors of the receiver are switched off. The CANH and CANL bus interface of the TLE6251D acts as a
high- impedance input with a very small leakage current. The high-ohmic input does not influence the
recessive level of the CAN network and allows an optimized EME performance of the entire CAN network.

TLE6251D
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with bus wake-up
Functional description
3.6           Remote wake-up
The TLE6251D has a remote wake-up feature, also called bus wake-up feature. In stand-by mode, the low-
power receiver monitors the activity on the CAN bus and in case it detects a wake-up signal, the TLE6251D
indicates the wake-up signal on the RxD output pin.
CAN bus signals, dominant or recessive, with a pulse width above the bus wake-up time t > tWU are indicated
on the RxD output pin (see Figure 5).
The wake-up logic is supplied by the power supply VIO (see Figure 1). In case the TLE6251D is in stand-by mode,
the power supply VCC can be turned off, while the TLE6251D is still able to detect the wake-up pattern on the
CAN bus.

Figure 5      Wake-up pattern
3.7           Voltage adaption to the microcontroller supply
The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D has two different power supplies, VCC and VIO. The power supply VCC supplies
the transmitter and the normal mode receiver, the power supply VIO supplies the digital input and output
buffers, the low-power receiver and the wake-up logic. To adjust the digital input and output levels of the
TLE6251D to the I/O levels of the external microcontroller, the power supply VIO should be connected to the
microcontroller pad supply (see Figure 11).
Supplying the low-power receiver by the VIO pin allows to switch off the VCC supply in stand-by mode and leads
to an additional reduction of the quiescent current in stand-by mode.

The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short-circuit proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device heats up due to a continuous
short on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus transmitter.
4.2           Unconnected logical pins
All logical input pins have an internal pull-up resistor to VIO. In case the VIO supply is activated and the logical
pins are open or floating, the TLE6251D enters the stand-by mode by default. In stand-by mode, the
transmitter of the TLE6251D is disabled, the bus bias is turned off and the input resistors of CANH and CANL
are connected to GND. The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251D will not influence the data on the CAN bus.
4.3           TxD time-out function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin can have its root cause in a locked-up
microcontroller or in a short on the printed circuit board, for example. In normal-operating mode, a logical
“low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out feature and the TLE6251D disables
the transmitter (see Figure 6). The receive unit is still active and the data on the bus continue to be monitored
by the RxD output pin.

Figure 6      TxD time-out function
Figure 6 shows how the transmitter is deactivated and re-activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the
TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter
after a TxD time-out event, the TLE6251D requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to
logical “high”.

Fail safe functions
4.4           Undervoltage detection
The HS CAN Transceiver TLE6251D is provided with undervoltage detection on the power supply VCC and the
power supply VIO. Both undervoltage detection monitors are active in normal-operating mode. In stand-by
mode only the VIO undervoltage monitoring is active, the VCC undervoltage monitoring is disabled.
In case the power supply VCC or VIO drops below a voltage level where the transceiver TLE6251D cannot
securely send data to the bus or receive data from the bus, the undervoltage detection disables the data
communication (see Figure 7).
The transmitter and the receiver are disabled, but the bus biasing remains connected to VCC/2. With a falling
VCC supply, the recessive level of the CAN bus signal decreases respectively.

4.5           Overtemperature protection
The TLE6251D has an integrated overtemperature detection circuit to protect the TLE6251D against thermal
overstress of the transmitter. The overtemperature protection is active in normal-operating mode and
disabled in stand-by mode. In case of an overtemperature condition, the temperature sensor will disable the
transmitter (see Figure 1) while the transceiver remains in normal-operating mode.
After the device cools down the transmitter is activated again (see Figure 8). A hysteresis is implemented
within the temperature sensor.

4.6           Delay time for mode change
During the mode change from stand-by mode to normal-operating mode or vice versa, the internal receive
unit switches from the low-power receiver to the normal mode receiver and vice versa. In order to avoid any
bit toggling on the RxD output pin, the RxD output is set to logical “high” during the mode change for the time
tMode and is not reflecting the signal on the CAN bus.
