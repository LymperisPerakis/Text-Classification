Single Wire CAN Transceiver
   The 33897 series provides a physical layer for digital
                                                                                                       33897
communication using a Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision
Resolution (CSMA/CR) data link operating over a single wire medium.
This is more commonly referred to as single-wire Controller Area
Network (SWCAN).                                                                                  SINGLE-WIRE CAN
                                                                                                     TRANSCEIVER
   The 33897 series operates directly from a vehicle's 12 V battery
system or a broad range of DC-power sources. It can operate at low or
high (33.33 kbps or 83.33 kbps) data rates. A high-voltage wake-up
feature allows the device to control the regulator used in support of the
MCU and other logic. The device includes a control pin that can be
used to put the module regulator into Sleep mode. The presence of a
defined wake-up voltage level on the bus will reactivate the control line
to turn the regulator and the system back ON.
   The device complies with the GMW3089v2.4 General Motors                                       EF (PB-FREE) SUFFIX

Notes
   1. ESD testing is performed in accordance with the Human Body Model (CZAP = 100 pF, RZAP = 1500 Ω),
        Machine Model (CZAP = 200 pF, RZAP = 0 Ω).
   2.   Pin soldering temperature limit is for 10 seconds maximum duration. Not designed for immersion soldering. Exceeding these limits may
        cause malfunction or permanent damage to the device.
   3.   Freescale’s Package Reflow capability meets Pb-free requirements for JEDEC standard J-STD-020C. For Peak Package Reflow
        Temperature and Moisture Sensitivity Levels (MSL), Go to www.freescale.com, search by part number [e.g. remove prefixes/suffixes and
        enter the core ID to view all orderable parts. (i.e. MC33xxxD enter 33xxx), and review parametrics.

Notes
   6. GMW3089V2.4 specifies the maximum load voltage rise to be 0.1 V whenever module battery is intact, including when in Sleep mode.
       The maximum load voltage rise of 1.0 V in Sleep mode is a GM-approved exception to GMW3089V2.4.
   7. 33897CT removes the diode drop during Sleep mode.
   8. LOAD pin is at system ground voltage.
   9. BUS pin is at system ground voltage
