  Thermal Management Solutions
From temperature measurement to critical over-temperature protection, Microchip’s thermal management solutions will help your
design operate at an optimal temperature. Ease-of-use, no firmware, high-integration and the ability to work with simple 2-wire fans,
are a few of the reasons engineers choose our Fan Speed Controllers and Fan Fault Detectors. Microchip also offers a wide
variety of logic, voltage, and serial output temperature sensors to thermally protect your system and ensure real-time temperature
measurement and compensation.
