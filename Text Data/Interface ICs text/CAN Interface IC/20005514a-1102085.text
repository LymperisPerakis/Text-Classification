powers up, the TXD pin could be unintentionally pulled
down by the microcontroller powering up. To avoid
driving the bus during a POR of the microcontroller,
the transceiver proceeds to Normal mode only after
TXD is high.
In Normal mode, the driver block is operational and
can drive the bus pins. The slopes of the output
signals on CANH and CANL are optimized to reduce
Electromagnetic Emissions (EME). The CAN bus is
biased to VDD/2.
The high-speed differential receiver is active.
1.6.4        STANDBY MODE
The device may be placed in Standby mode by
applying a high level to the STBY pin. In Standby
mode, the transmitter and the high-speed part of the
receiver are switched off to minimize power
consumption.

1.7.10       STANDBY MODE INPUT PIN (STBY)
This pin selects between Normal or Standby mode. In
Standby mode, the transmitter and high-speed receiver
are turned off, only the low-power receiver and wake-up
filter are active. STBY is connected from an internal
MOS pull-up resistor to VIO in the MCP2542FD and
MCP2542WFD, and to VDD in the MCP2544FD and
MCP2544WFD. The value of the MOS pull-up resistor
depends on the supply voltage. Typical values are
660 k for 5V, 1.1 M for 3.3V and 4.4 M for 1.8V.
1.7.11       EXPOSED THERMAL PAD (EP)
It is recommended to connect this pad to VSS to
enhance electromagnetic immunity and thermal
resistance.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
