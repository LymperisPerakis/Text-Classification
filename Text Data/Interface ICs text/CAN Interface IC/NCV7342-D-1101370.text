NCV7342
High Speed Low Power CAN
Transceiver
Description
  The NCV7342 CAN transceiver is the interface between a
controller area network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical
bus and may be used in both 12 V and 24 V systems. The transceiver                           www.onsemi.com
provides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential
receive capability to the CAN controller.
  The NCV7342 is an addition to the CAN high−speed transceiver                     8
family complementing NCV734x CAN stand−alone transceivers and                                1                          1

and other design features, the NCV7342 is able to reach outstanding
levels of electromagnetic susceptibility (EMS). Similarly, extremely
low electromagnetic emission (EME) is achieved by the excellent                         MARKING DIAGRAMS
