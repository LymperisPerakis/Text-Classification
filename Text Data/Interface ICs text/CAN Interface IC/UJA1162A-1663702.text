                       advanced power management.
                   6.1 System controller
                       The system controller is a state machine that manages register configuration and controls
                       the internal functions of the UJA1162A. UJA1162A operating modes and state transitions
                       are illustrated in Figure 3. These modes are discussed in more detail in the following
                       sections.
                6.1.1 Operating modes
                       The UJA1162A supports five operating modes: Normal, Standby, Sleep, Overtemp and
                       Off.
               6.1.1.1 Normal mode
                       Normal mode is the active operating mode. In this mode, the UJA1162A is fully
                       operational. Normal mode can be selected from Standby and Sleep (via Standby) modes
                       by setting pin SLPN HIGH, provided VIO > Vuvd(VIO). The UJA1162A exits Normal mode:
                         • if the microcontroller selects Standby mode by setting pin SLPN LOW
                         • if the UJA1162A detects an undervoltage on VIO, causing the UJA1162A to switch to
                            Standby mode
                         • if the chip temperature rises above Tth(act)otp, causing the UJA1162A to switch to
                            Overtemp mode
                         • if the battery supply voltage drops below Vth(det)poff, causing the UJA1162A to switch
                            to Off mode
                       All pending wake-up events (power-on, CAN bus wake-up, local wake-up via the WAKE
                       pin) are cleared when the UJA1162A enters Normal mode.

  Fig 3.     UJA1162A system controller state diagram
                6.1.1.2     Standby mode
                            Standby mode is a transitional mode between Normal and Sleep modes. The transceiver
                            is unable to transmit or receive data in Standby mode, but pin INH is active.
                            The receiver monitors bus activity for a wake-up request in Standby mode. The bus pins
                            are biased at GND level (via Ri(cm)) when the bus is inactive for t > tto(silence) and at
                            approximately 2.5 V when there is activity on the bus (autonomous biasing). Wake-up can
                            be triggered remotely via a standard wake-up pattern on the CAN bus (see Section 6.3.2)
                            or locally via the WAKE pin. Pin RXD is forced LOW when a bus or local wake-up event is
                            detected.
                            The UJA1162A switches to Standby mode:
                              • from Normal mode if pin SLPN goes LOW or and undervoltage is detected on VIO
                              • from Sleep mode in the event of a local or remote wake-up event or if SLPN = HIGH
                                  (with a valid voltage on VIO)

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                           UJA1162A
                                                               Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Sleep mode
               6.1.1.3 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode is the power-saving mode of the UJA1162A. In Sleep mode, the transceiver
                       behaves as in Standby Mode, with the exception that pin INH is set floating and
                       temperature protection is inactive. Voltage regulators controlled by this pin are switched
                       off, and the current into pin BAT is reduced to a minimum.
                       A HIGH level on SLPN (provided a valid voltage is present on VIO), a local wake-up via
                       the WAKE pin or a remote CAN bus wake-up will cause the UJA1162A to wake up from
                       Sleep mode and switch to Standby mode. Pin RXD is forced LOW when a local wake-up
                       via WAKE or a remote bus wake-up is detected.
                       The UJA1162A can be set to Sleep mode by holding pin SLPN LOW for t > tsleep (provided
                       there are no wake-up events pending). If one or more wake-up events is pending, the
                       UJA1162A will remain in Standby mode. The UJA1162A must be switched to Normal
                       mode to clear pending wake-up events.
                       The UJA1162A will also be forced to Sleep mode if an undervoltage lasting longer than
                       td(uvd-slp) is detected on VIO (VIO < Vuvd(VIO)). In this event, all pending wake-up events will
                       be cleared automatically.
               6.1.1.4 Off mode
                       The UJA1162A switches to Off mode from any mode when VBAT < Vth(det)poff. Only
                       power-on detection is enabled; all other modules are inactive. The UJA1162A starts to
                       boot up when the battery voltage rises above the power-on detection threshold Vth(det)pon
                       (triggering an initialization process) and switches to Standby mode after tstartup. Pin RXD is
                       driven LOW when the UJA1162A switches from Off mode to Standby mode, to indicate a
                       power-on event has occurred.
                       In Off mode, the CAN pins disengage from the bus (zero load; high-ohmic).
               6.1.1.5 Overtemp mode
                       Overtemp mode is provided to prevent the UJA1162A being damaged by excessive
                       temperatures. The UJA1162A switches immediately to Overtemp mode from Normal
                       mode when the global chip temperature rises above the overtemperature protection
                       activation threshold, Tth(act)otp.
                       In Overtemp mode, the CAN transmitter and receiver are disabled and the CAN pins are
                       in a high-ohmic state. No wake-up event will be detected, but a pending wake-up will still
                       be signalled by a LOW level on pin RXD, which will persist after the overtemperature
                       event has been cleared. VBUF is off in Overtemp mode. INH remains unchanged.
                       The UJA1162A exits Overtemp mode:
                         • and switches to Standby mode if the chip temperature falls below the overtemperature
                            protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp
                         • if the device is forced to switch to Off mode (VBAT < Vth(det)poff)

[1]   VBUF is switched on in Standby mode if a CAN wake-up pattern is detected on the bus; if pin SLPN does not go HIGH within tto(silence),
      VBUF is switched off again. VBUF is also switched on in Standby mode if SLPN goes HIGH to select Normal mode.
                    6.1.2 Mode control via pin SLPN
                             The UJA1162A can be switched between Normal and Standby/Sleep modes via the SLPN
                             control input (see Figure 3). When SLPN goes LOW, the UJA1162A switches to Standby
                             mode. If SLPN remains low for tsleep, the UJA1162A then switches to Sleep mode (if no
                             wake-up is pending). When SLPN goes HIGH, the UJA1162A switches to Normal mode.
                      6.2 Power supplies
                    6.2.1 Battery supply voltage (VBAT)
                             The internal circuitry is supplied from the battery via pin BAT. The device needs to be
                             protected against negative supply voltages, e.g. by using an external series diode. If VBAT
                             falls below the power-off detection threshold, Vth(det)poff, the UJA1162A switches to Off
                             mode, which means that the internal 5 V CAN supply and other internal logic (except for
                             power-on detection) are shut down.
                             The UJA1162A switches from Off mode to Standby mode tstartup after the battery voltage
                             rises above the power-on detection threshold, Vth(det)pon. A power-on event is indicated by
                             a LOW level on pin RXD. RXD remains LOW from the moment UJA1162A exits Off mode
                             until it switches to Normal mode.
                    6.2.2 CAN supply voltage (VBUF)
                             VBUF provides the internal CAN transceiver with a 5 V supply. The output voltage on BUF
                             is monitored. If VBUF falls below the 90 % undervoltage threshold (90 % of the nominal
                             VBUF output voltage), the CAN transceiver switches to (or remains in) Offline mode.
                      6.3 High-speed CAN transceiver
                             The integrated high-speed CAN transceiver is designed for active communication at bit
                             rates up to 1 Mbit/s, providing differential transmit and receive capability to a CAN protocol
                             controller. The transceiver is ISO 11898-2:2016 compliant. The CAN transmitter is
                             supplied from VBUF. The UJA1162A includes additional timing parameters on loop delay
                             symmetry to ensure reliable communication in fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s, as
                             used in CAN FD networks.
                             The CAN transceiver supports autonomous CAN biasing, which helps to minimize RF

                                                                 Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Sleep mode
                       Standby or Sleep mode with the CAN transceiver in CAN Offline mode - to 2.5 V if there is
                       activity on the bus (CAN Offline Bias mode) and to GND if there is no activity on the bus
                       for t > tto(silence) (CAN Offline mode). This is useful when the node is disabled due to a
                       malfunction in the microcontroller. The transceiver ensures that the CAN bus is correctly
                       biased to avoid disturbing ongoing communication between other nodes. The
                       autonomous CAN bias voltage is derived directly from VBAT.
                6.3.1 CAN operating modes
                       The integrated CAN transceiver supports three operating modes: Active, Offline and
                       Offline Bias (see Figure 5). The CAN transceiver operating mode depends on the
                       UJA1162A operating mode and the output voltage on pin BUF.
               6.3.1.1 CAN Active mode
                       In CAN Active mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via CANH and CANL.
                       The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data, which
                       is output on pin RXD. The transmitter converts digital data generated by the CAN
                       controller (input on pin TXD) into analog signals suitable for transmission over the CANH
                       and CANL bus lines.
                       The CAN transceiver is in Active mode when:
                         • the UJA1162A is in Normal mode (SLPN = 1) AND
                         • VBUF > Vuvd(BUF) AND
                         • VIO > Vuvd(VIO)
                       In CAN Active mode, the CAN bias voltage is derived from VBUF. If VBUF falls below
                       Vuvd(BUF), the UJA1162A exits CAN Active mode and enters CAN Offline Bias mode with
                       autonomous CAN voltage biasing via pin BAT.
                       If pin TXD is LOW when the transceiver switches to CAN Active mode (UJA1162A in
                       Normal mode; VBUF and VIO ok), the transmitter and receiver will remain disabled until
                       TXD goes HIGH. This prevents network traffic being blocked for tto(dom)TXD (i.e. while the
                       TXD dominant time-out timer is running; see Section 6.7.1) every time the transceiver
                       enters Active mode, if the TXD pin is clamped permanently LOW.
               6.3.1.2 CAN Offline and Offline Bias modes
                       In CAN Offline mode, the transceiver monitors the CAN bus for a wake-up event. CANH
                       and CANL are biased to GND.
                       CAN Offline Bias mode is the same as CAN Offline mode, with the exception that the CAN
                       bus is biased to 2.5 V. This mode is activated automatically when activity is detected on
                       the CAN bus while the transceiver is in CAN Offline mode. The transceiver will return to
                       CAN Offline mode if the CAN bus is silent (no CAN bus edges) for longer than tto(silence).
                       The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline mode from CAN Active mode when:
                         • the UJA1162A switches to Standby or Sleep mode
                       provided the CAN-bus has been inactive for at least tto(silence). If the CAN-bus has been
                       inactive for less than tto(silence), the CAN transceiver switches first to CAN Offline Bias
                       mode and then to CAN Offline mode once the bus has been silent for tto(silence).
                       The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline Bias mode from CAN Active mode if:

                               • VBUF < Vuvd(BUF) OR VIO < Vuvd(VIO)
                            The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline mode:
                               • from CAN Offline Bias mode when the UJA1162A is in Standby or Sleep mode and no
                                  activity has been detected on the bus (no CAN edges) for t > tto(silence) OR
                               • when the UJA1162A switches from Off or Overtemp mode to Standby mode
                            The CAN transceiver switches from CAN Offline mode to CAN Offline Bias mode if:
                               • a standard wake-up pattern is detected on the CAN bus OR
                               • the UJA1162A switches to Normal mode while VBUF < Vuvd(BUF) OR VIO < Vuvd(VIO)
                 6.3.1.3    CAN Off mode
                            The CAN transceiver is switched off completely with the bus lines floating when:
                               • the UJA1162A switches to Off or Overtemp mode OR
                               • VBAT falls below the CAN receiver undervoltage detection threshold, Vuvd(CAN)
                            It will be switched on again on entering CAN Offline mode when VBAT rises above the
                            undervoltage recovery threshold (Vuvr(CAN)) and the UJA1162A is no longer in
                            Off/Overtemp mode. CAN Off mode prevents reverse currents flowing from the bus when
                            the battery supply to the UJA1162A is lost.
                   6.3.2 CAN standard wake-up
                            The UJA1162A monitors the bus for a wake-up pattern when the CAN transceiver is in
                            Offline mode.
                            A filter at the receiver input prevents unwanted wake-up events occurring due to
                            automotive transients or EMI. A dominant-recessive-dominant wake-up pattern must be
                            transmitted on the CAN bus within the wake-up timeout time (tto(wake)) to pass the wake-up
                            filter and trigger a wake-up event (see Figure 4; note that additional pulses may occur
                            between the recessive/dominant phases). The recessive and dominant phases must last
                            at least twake(busrec) and twake(busdom), respectively.
                            Pin RXD is driven LOW when a valid CAN wake-up pattern is detected on the bus.

                     6.4 WAKE pin
                              In Standby and Sleep modes, a local wake-up event is triggered by a LOW-to-HIGH or a
                              HIGH-to-LOW transition on the WAKE pin. In applications that don’t make use of the local
                              wake-up facility, the WAKE pin should be connected to GND for optimal EMI performance.
                              Pin RXD is driven LOW when a valid edge is detected on pin WAKE.
                     6.5 VIO supply pin
                              Pin VIO should be connected to the microcontroller supply voltage. This will cause the
                              signal levels on TXD, RXD, SLPN and CTS to be adjusted to the I/O levels of the

                                                             Self-supplied high-speed CAN transceiver with Sleep mode
                   6.6 CAN transceiver status pin (CTS)
                       Pin CTS is driven HIGH to indicate to microcontroller that the transceiver is fully enabled
                       and data can be transmitted and received via the TXD/RXD pins.
                       Pin CTS is actively driven LOW:
                         • while the transceiver is starting up (e.g. during a transition from Standby to Normal
                            mode) or
                         • if pin TXD is clamped LOW for t > tto(dom)TXD or
                         • if an undervoltage is detected on VIO or BUF
                   6.7 CAN fail-safe features
                6.7.1 TXD dominant timeout
                       A TXD dominant time-out timer is started when pin TXD is forced LOW while the
                       transceiver is in CAN Active Mode. If the LOW state on pin TXD persists for longer than
                       the TXD dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                       lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                       failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                       traffic). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD goes HIGH. The TXD
                       dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 4.4 kbit/s.
                6.7.2 Pull-up on TXD pin
                       Pin TXD has an internal pull-up (towards VIO) to ensure a safe defined recessive driver
                       state in case the pin is left floating.
                6.7.3 Pull-down on SLPN pin
                       Pin SLPN has an internal pull-down (to GND) to ensure the UJA1162A switches to Sleep
                       mode if SLPN is left floating.
                6.7.4 Loss of power at pin BAT
                       A loss of power at pin BAT has no impact on the bus lines or on the microcontroller. No
                       reverse currents flow from the bus.

         (1) Actual capacitance value must be a least 1.76 F with 5 V DC offset (recommended capacitor value is 6.8 F).
         (2) For bus line end nodes, RT = 60  in order to support the ‘split termination concept’. For sub-nodes, an optional ‘weak’
              termination of e.g. RT = 1.3 k can be used, if required by the OEM.

14. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 13) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 8 and 9

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 13.
