TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Overview
Description
As a successor of the TLE6251G, the TLE6251-2G is designed to provide an excellent passive behavior in Power
Down. This feature makes the TLE6251-2G extremely suitable for mixed power supply HS-CAN networks. The
TLE6251-2G provides different operation modes with a very low quiescent current in Sleep mode. Based on
the high symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE6251-2G provides a very low level of electromagnetic
emission (EME) within a broad frequency range. The TLE6251-2G is integrated in a RoHS compliant PG-DSO-14
package and fulfills or exceeds the requirements of the ISO11898-5. The TLE6251G and the TLE6251-2G are
fully pin compatible and function compatible.

High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Functional Description
4            Functional Description
CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensor and actuators for real-time control
applications. The usage of the Control Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7 layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a CAN
bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes inside the
network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical
specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several
different physical layer standards of CAN networks have been developed over the last years. The TLE6251-2G
is a High Speed CAN transceiver with dedicated Wake-Up functions. High Speed CAN Transceivers with Wake-
Up functions are defined by the international standard ISO 11898-5.

TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Functional Description
The TLE6251-2G is a High Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and
the physical bus medium. A High Speed CAN network (abbreviated HS CAN) is a two wire differential network
which allows data transmission rates up to 1 MBaud. Characteristic for a HS CAN network are the two CAN bus
states dominant and recessive (see Figure 3).
A HS CAN network is a Carrier Sense Multiple Access network with Collision Detection. This means, every
participant of the CAN network is allowed to place its message on the same bus media simultaneously. This
can cause data collisions on the bus, which might corrupt the information content of the data stream. In order
avoid the loss of any information and to prioritize the messages, it is essential that the dominant bus signal
overrules the recessive bus signal.
The input TxD and the output RxD are connected to the microcontroller of the ECU. As shown in Figure 1, the
HS CAN transceiver TLE6251-2G has a receive unit and a output stage, allowing the transceiver to send data to
the bus medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN TLE6251-2G
converts the serial data stream available on the transmit data input TxD into a differential output signal on
CAN bus. The differential output signal is provided by the pins CANH and CANL. The receiver stage of the
TLE6251-2G monitors the data on the CAN bus and converts them to a serial data stream on the RxD pin. A
“low” signal on the TxD pin creates a dominant signal on the CAN bus, followed by a “low” signal on the RxD
pin (see Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the
CAN bus simultaneous is essential to support the bit to bit arbitration on CAN networks.
The voltage levels for a HS CAN on the bus medium are defined by the ISO 11898-2/-5 standards. Whether a
data bit is dominant or recessive, depends on the voltage difference between CANH and CANL:
VDIFF = VCANH - VCANL
To transmit a dominant signal to the CAN bus the differential signal VDIFF is larger or equal to 1.5 V. To receive
a recessive signal from the CAN bus the differential signal VDIFF is smaller or equal to 0.5 V.
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level
at the pin VIO. Depending on voltage level at the VIO pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (EN, NERR, NSTB, TxD
and RxD) are compatible to microcontrollers with 5 V or 3.3 V I/O supply. Usually the VIO power supply of the
transceiver is connected to same power supply as I/O power supply of the microcontroller.
Partially supplied CAN networks are networks where the participants have a different power supply status.
Some nodes are powered up, other nodes are not powered, or some other nodes are in a Low-Power mode,
like Sleep mode for example. Regardless on the supply status of the HS CAN node, each participant which is
connected to the common bus, shall not disturb the communication on the bus media. The TLE6251-2G is
designed to support partially supplied networks. In Power Down condition, the resistors of the Normal
Receiver are switched off and the bus input on the pins CANH and CANL is high resistive.

Operation Modes
5                Operation Modes
Five different operation modes are available on TLE6251-2G. Each mode with specific characteristics in terms
of quiescent current, data transmission or failure diagnostic. For the mode selection the digital input pins EN
and NSTB are used. Both digital input pins are event triggered. Figure 4 illustrates the different mode changes
depending on the status of the EN and NSTB pins. A mode change via the mode selections pins EN and NSTB
is only possible when the power supplies VCC, VIO and VS are active.

TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Operation Modes
In Sleep mode the power supply VCC and the logic power supply VIO are usually turned off. A Wake-Up event,
via the CAN bus or the local Wake-Up pin, shifts the device from Sleep mode into Stand-By mode.
The following operation modes are available on the TLE6251-2G:
•   Normal Operation mode
•   Receive-Only mode
•   Stand-By mode
•   Sleep mode
•   Go-To-Sleep command
Depending on the operation mode, the output driver stage, the receiver stage, the split termination and the
bus biasing are active or inactive. Table 2 shows the different operation modes depending on the logic signal
on the pins EN and NSTB with the related status of the INH pin, the SPLIT pin and the bus biasing.

5.1          Normal Operation Mode
In Normal Operation mode the HS CAN transceiver TLE6251-2G sends the serial data stream on the TxD pin to
the CAN bus while at the same time the data available on the CAN bus is monitored on the RxD output pin. In
Normal Operation mode all functions of the TLE6251-2G are active:
•   The output stage is active and drives data from the TxD to the CAN bus.
•   The normal receiver unit is active and provides the data from the CAN bus to the RxD pin.
•   The low power receiver and the bus Wake-Up function is inactive.
•   The local Wake-Up pin is disabled.
•   The INH pin is connected to VS.
•   The RxD pin is “low” for a dominant bus signal and “high” for a recessive bus signal”
•   The SPLIT pin is set to VCC/2.
•   The bus basing is set to VCC/2.
•   The failure detection is active and failures are indicated at the NERR pin. (see Chapter 8).
•   The under-voltage detection on the all 3 power supplies VCC, VIO and VS is active.
The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251-2G enters Normal Operation mode by setting the mode selection pins EN and
NSTB to “high” (see Table 2 or Figure 4).
5.2          Receive-Only Mode
The Receive-Only mode can be used to test the connection of the bus medium. The TLE6251-2G can still
receive data from the bus, but the output stage is disabled and therefore no data can be sent to the CAN bus.
All other functions are active:

                                                                                                       2019-08-21


TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Operation Modes
•   The output stage is disabled and data which is available on the TxD pin will be blocked and not
    communicated to the CAN bus.
•   The normal receiver unit is active and provides the data which is available on the CAN bus to the RxD pin.
•   The INH pin is connected to VS.
•   The RxD pin is “low” for a dominant bus signal and “high” for a recessive bus signal.
•   The SPLIT pin is set to VCC/2.
•   The bus biasing is set to VCC/2.
•   The low power receiver and the bus Wake-Up function is inactive.
•   The local Wake-Up pin WK is disabled.
•   The failure diagnostic is active and local failures are indicated at the NERR pin (see Chapter 8).
•   The under-voltage detection on the all 3 power supplies VCC, VIO and VS is active.
The HS CAN transceiver TLE6251-2G enters Receive-Only mode by setting the EN pin to “low” and the NSTB to
“high” (see Table 2 or Figure 4).
5.3           Stand-By Mode
After the power-up sequence the TLE6251-2G enters automatically into Stand-By mode. Stand-By mode is an
idle mode of the TLE6251-2G with optimized power consumption. In Stand-By mode the TLE6251-2G can not
send or receive any data. The output driver stage and the normal receiver unit are disabled. Both CAN bus pins,
CANH and CANL are connected to GND and the Split termination output is floating. The following functions are
available in Stand-By mode:
•   The output stage is disabled.
•   The normal receiver unit is disabled.
•   The low power receiver is active and monitors the CAN bus. In case of a message on the CAN bus the
    TLE6251-2G sets an internal Wake-Up flag. If the power supplies VCC and VIO are active, the Wake-Up event
    is indicated by the RxD pin and the NERR pin (see Chapter 8). After first power-up or after an undervoltage
    event on VS a wake-up is not signaled on RxD and NERR pin.
•   The local Wake-Up pin is active and a local Wake-Up event is indicated by the RxD and NERR pin, if the
    power supplies VCC and VIO are active (see Chapter 8).
•   The INH output is active and set to VS.
•   Through the internal resistors RI (see Figure 1), the pins CANH and CANL are connected to GND.
•   If the power supplies VCC and VIO are active, the RxD pin indicates the Wake-Up events.
•   The TxD pin is disabled
•   The failure diagnostic is disabled.
•   The under-voltage detection on the all 3 power supplies VCC, VIO and VS is active.
•   The TLE6251-2G detects a Power-Up event and indicates it at the NERR pin (see Chapter 8).
There are several ways to enter the Stand-By mode (see Figure 4):
•   After the start-up sequence the device enters per default Stand-By mode. Mode changes are only possible
    when VCC and VIO are present.
•   The device is in Sleep mode and a Wake-Up event occurs.
•   The device is in the Go-To-Sleep command and the EN pin goes low before the time t < thSLP has expired.
•   The device is in Normal Operation mode or Receive-Only mode and the EN pin and NSTB pin are set to
    “low”.

TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Operation Modes
•    An under-voltage event occurs on the power supply VS. In case of an under-voltage event, the TLE6251-2G
     device always changes to Stand-By mode regardless in which mode the device currently operates.
5.4            Go-To-Sleep Command
The Go-To-Sleep command is a transition mode allowing external circuitry like a microcontroller to prepare
the ECU for the Sleep mode. The TLE6251-2G stays in the Go-To-Sleep command for the maximum time
t = thSLP, after exceeding the time thSLP the device changes into Sleep mode. A mode change into Sleep mode is
only possible via the Go-To-Sleep command. During the Go-To-Sleep command the following functions on the
TLE6251-2G are available:
•    The output driver stage is disabled.
•    The normal receiver unit is disabled.
•    The low power receiver is active and monitors the CAN bus. In case of a message on the CAN bus the
     TLE6251-2G sets an internal Wake-Up flag.
•    The local Wake-Up pin is active and can detect a local Wake-Up event.
•    The INH output is active and set to VS.
•    Through the internal resistors RI (see Figure 1), the pins CANH and CANL are connected to GND.
•    The TxD pin is disabled.
•    The failure diagnostic is disabled.
•    The under-voltage detection on all 3 power supplies VCC, VIO and VS is active.
Setting the NSTB pin to “low”, while the EN signal remains at “high”, activates the Go-To-Sleep command. The
Go-To-Sleep command can be entered from Normal Operation mode, Receive-Only mode and from Stand-By
mode.
5.5            Sleep Mode
The Sleep mode is a power save mode. In Sleep mode the current consumption of the TLE6251-2G is reduced
to a minimum while the device is still able to Wake-Up by a message on the CAN bus or a local Wake-Up event
on the pin WK. Most of the functions of the TLE6251-2G are disabled:
•    The output driver stage is disabled.
•    The normal receiver unit is disabled.
•    The low power receiver is active and monitors the CAN bus. In case of a message on the CAN bus the
     TLE6251-2G changes from Sleep mode to Stand-By mode and sets an internal Wake-Up flag.
•    The local Wake-Up pin is active and in case of a signal change on the WK pin the operation mode changes to
     Stand-By mode.
•    The INH output is floating.
•    Through the internal resistors RI (see Figure 1), the pins CANH and CANL are connected to GND.
•    If the power supplies VCC and VIO are present, the RxD pin indicates the Wake-Up event.
•    The TxD pin is disabled
•    The under-voltage detection on the power supply VS is active and sends the device into Stand-By mode in
     case of an under-voltage event.
There are only two ways to enter Sleep mode:
•    The device can activate the Sleep mode via the mode control pins EN and NSTB.
•    An under-voltage event on the power supplies VCC and VIO changes the operation mode to Sleep mode.
In order to enter the Stand-By mode or the Sleep mode, the EN signal needs to be set to “low” a defined time
after the NSTB pin was set to “low”. Important for the mode selection is the timing between the falling edge

of the NSTB signal and the EN signal. If the logical signal on the EN pin goes “low” before the transition time t
< thSLP has been reached, the TLE6251-2G enters Stand-By mode and the INH pin remains connected to the VS
supply. In the case the logical signal on the EN pin goes “low” after the transition time t > thSLP, the TLE6251-
2G enters into Sleep mode simultaneous with the expiration of the time window thSLP and the INH becomes
disconnected from the VS supply and is floating. (see Figure 5).

TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Wake-Up Functions
6             Wake-Up Functions
There are several possibilities for a mode change from Sleep mode to another operation mode.
•   Remote Wake-Up via a message on the CAN bus.
•   Local Wake-Up via a signal change on the pin WK.
•   A status change of the logical signals applied to the mode control pins EN and NSTB.
•   An under-voltage detection on the VS power supply.
In typical applications the power supplies VCC and VIO are turned off in Sleep mode, meaning a mode change
can only be caused by an external event, also called Wake-Up. In case the VCC and VIO power supply are
available, a mode change can be simple caused by changing the status on the mode control pins EN and NSTB.
6.1           Remote Wake-Up
A remote Wake-Up or also called bus Wake-Up occurs via a CAN bus message and changes the operation mode
from Sleep mode to Stand-By mode. A signal change from recessive to dominant, followed by a dominant
signal for the time t > tWake initiates a bus Wake-Up (see Figure 6).

In case the time of the dominant signal on the CAN bus is shorter than the filtering time tWake, no bus Wake-Up
occurs. The filter time is implemented to protect the HS CAN transceiver TLE6251-2G against unintended bus
Wake-Up’s, triggered by spikes on the CAN bus. The signal change on the CAN bus from recessive to dominant
is mandatory, a permanent dominant signal would not activate any bus Wake-Up.
In Stand-By mode the RxD output pin and the NERR output pin display the CAN bus Wake-Up event by a “low”
signal (details see Chapter 8). Once the HS CAN Transceiver TLE6251-2G has recognized the Wake-Up event
and has changed to Stand-By mode, the INH output pin becomes active and provides the voltage VS to the
external circuitry.

6.2          Local Wake-Up
The TLE6251-2G can be activated from Sleep mode by a signal change on the WK pin, also called local Wake-
Up. Designed to withstand voltages up to 40V the WK pin can be directly connected to VS. The internal logic on
the WK pin works bi-sensitive, meaning the Wake-Up logic on the pin WK triggers on a both signal changes,
from “high” to “low” and from “low” to “high” (see Figure 7).

A filter time tWK(local) is implemented to protect the TLE6251-2G against unintended Wake-Up’s, caused by

In Stand-By mode the RxD output pin and the NERR output pin display the CAN bus Wake-Up event by a logical
“low” signal (details see Chapter 8). Once the HS CAN Transceiver TLE6251-2G has recognized the Wake-Up

6.3         Mode Change via the EN and NSTB pin
Besides a mode change issued by a Wake-Up event, the operation mode on the TLE6251-2G can be changed
by changing the signals on the EN and NSTB pins. Therefore the power supplies VCC and VIO must be active.
According to the mode diagram in Figure 4 the operation mode can be changed directly from Sleep mode to
the Receive-Only mode and to the Normal Operation mode. A change from Sleep mode direct to Stand-By
mode is only possible via a Wake-Up event. For example by setting the NSTB pin and the EN pin to “high” the
TLE6251-2G changes from Sleep mode to Normal Operation mode (see Figure 8).
The pins EN and NSTB have a hysteresis between the “low” and the “high” signal in order to avoid any toggling
during the operation mode change.

7.1           CAN Bus Failure Detection
The High Speed CAN Transceiver TLE6251-2G is equipped with a bus failure detection unit. In Normal
Operation mode the TLE6251-2G can detect the following bus failures:
•   CANH shorted to GND
•   CANL shorted to GND
•   CANH shorted to VCC
•   CANL shorted to VCC
•   CANH shorted to VS
•   CANL shorted to VS
The TLE6251-2G can not detect the bus failures:
•   CANH open
•   CANL open
•   CANH short to CANL
The TLE6251-2G detects the bus failures while sending a dominant signal to the CAN bus. After sending four
dominant bits to the CAN bus, a “low” on the NERR pins indicates the CAN bus failure. For the failure indication
the dominant bits require a minimum pulse width of 4 µs. In case the TLE6251-2G detects an CAN bus failure,
the failure is only indicated by the NERR pin, the transceiver doesn’t stop or block the communication, by
disabling the output stage for example.

communication as an example and it shall not be considered as a liability that on HS CAN networks the CAN
bus communication continues in every CAN bus failure case.
7.2            Local Failures
If a local failure occurs during the operation of the TLE6251-2G, the device sets an internal local failure flag.
The local failure flag can be displayed to the microcontroller during the Receive-Only mode and the failures
are indicated by a “low” signal on the NERR pin. The following local failures can be detected:
•   TxD time-out
•   TxD to RxD Short
•   RxD permanent Recessive Clamping
•   Bus Dominant Clamping
•   Over-Temperature Detection
7.2.1          TxD Time-Out Feature
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”.
In Normal Operation mode, a “low” signal on the TxD input pin for the time t > tTXD enables the TxD time-out
feature and the TLE6251-2G disables the output driver stage. In Receive-Only mode the TLE6251-2G indicates
the TxD time-out by a “low” signal on the NERR pin (see Figure 10). To release the output driver stage after the
permanent “low” signal on the TxD input pin disappears, a mode change from Receive-Only mode to Normal
Operation mode is required.

Figure 10     TxD Time-Out Feature
7.2.2        TxD to RxD Short Circuit Feature
A short between the pins TxD and RxD causes permanent blocking of the CAN bus. In the case, that the low side
driver capability of the RxD output pin is stronger as the high side driver capability of the external
microcontroller output, which is connected to the TxD pin of the TLE6251-2G, the RxD output signal overrides
the TxD signal provided by the microcontroller. In this case a continuous dominant signal blocks the CAN bus.
The TLE6251-2G detects the short between the TxD and the RxD pin, disables the output driver stage and sets
the internal local failure flag. In Receive-Only mode the TLE6251-2G indicates the TxD to RxD short by a “low”
signal on the NERR pin. The TLE6251-2G releases the failure flag and the output driver stage by an operation
mode change from Receive-Only mode to Normal Operation mode.
7.2.3        RxD Permanent Recessive Clamping
A “High” signal on the RxD pin indicates the external microcontroller, that there is no CAN message on the
CAN bus. The microcontroller can transmit a message to the CAN bus only when the bus is recessive. In case
the “high” signal on the RxD pin is caused by a failure, like a short from RxD to VIO, the RxD signal doesn’t mirror
the signal on the CAN bus. This allows the microcontroller to place a message to the CAN bus at any time and
corrupts CAN bus messages on the bus. The TLE6251-2G detects a permanent “high” signal on the RxD pin and
set the local error flag. In order to avoid any data collisions on the CAN bus the output driver stage gets
disabled. In Receive-Only mode the TLE6251-2G indicates the RxD clamping by a “low” signal on the NERR pin.

7.2.4         Bus Dominant Clamping
Due to a fail function on one of the CAN bus participants, the CAN bus could be permanent in dominant state.
The external microcontroller doesn’t transmit any data to the CAN bus as long as the CAN bus remains
dominant. Even if the permanent dominant state on the CAN bus is caused by a short from CANH to VCC, or
similar, the transceiver can not detect the failure, because the CAN bus failure detection works only when the
transceiver is active sending data to the bus. Therefore the TLE6251-2G has a bus dominant clamping
detection unit installed. In case the bus signal is dominant for the time t > tBus,t the TLE6251-2G detects the bus
clamping and sets the local failure flag. The output driver stage remains active. In Receive-Only mode the
TLE6251-2G indicates the bus dominant clamping by a “low” signal on the NERR pin.
7.2.5         Over-Temperature Detection
The output driver stage is protected against over temperature. Exceeding the shutdown temperature results
in deactivation of the output driver stage. To avoid any toggling after the device cools down, the output driver
stage is enabled again only after a recessive to dominant signal change on the TxD pin (see Figure 11).
An Over-Temperature event only deactivates the output driver stage, the TLE6251-2G doesn’t change its
operation mode in this failure case. The overtemperature event is indicated by a “low” signal on the NERR pin
in Receive-Only mode.

TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Fail Safe Features
7.3          Under-Voltage Detection
The TLE6251-2G provides a power supply monitoring on all three power supply pins: VCC, VIO and VS. In case of
an under - voltage event on any of this three power supplies, the TLE6251-2G changes the operation mode and
sets an internal failure flag. The internal failure flag is not indicated by the NERR output pin.
7.3.1        Under-Voltage event on VCC and VIO
An under-voltage event on the power supply VCC or the power supply VIO causes the change of the operation
mode to Sleep mode, regardless of the operation mode in which the TLE6251-2G might currently operate. The
logical signals on the digital input pins EN and NSTB are also disregarded. After the power supplies VCC and VIO
are activated again, the operation mode can be changed the usual way. From Sleep mode to Stand-By mode
by a Wake-Up event or from Sleep mode direct to Normal Operation mode, Receive-Only mode by the digital
input pins EN and NSTB.
The under-voltage monitoring on the power supply VCC and VIO is combined with an internal filter time. Only if
the voltage drop on each of these two power supplies is longer present as the time tDrop > tUV(VIO) (tDrop > tUV(VCC))
the operation mode change is activated (see Figure 12).
Under-voltage events on the power supplies VCC or VIO are not indicated by the NERR pin nor by the RxD pin.

TLE6251-2G
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Wake and Failure Detection
Fail Safe Features
7.3.2         Under-Voltage Event on VS
If an under-voltage event is detected at the power supply VS, the TLE6251-2G immediately enters Stand-By
mode, regardless of the operation mode in which the TLE6251-2G operates. After the power supply VS has
been reestablished, the operation mode can be changed by applying a “high” signal to the EN pin or the NSTB
pin.
In the case the TLE6251-2G detects an under-voltage event on the VCC or VIO power supply, the TLE6251-2G
changes to Sleep mode. If the TLE6251-2G detects in Sleep mode an under-voltage event on the VS power
supply, the device enters Stand-By mode, even when the under-voltage event on the VCC or VIO power supply
is still present.

7.4           Voltage Adaptation
The advantage of the adaptive microcontroller logic is the ratio metrical scaling of the I/O levels depending on
the input voltage at the VIO pin. Connecting the VIO input to the I/O supply of the microcontroller ensures, that
the I/O voltage of the microcontroller fits to the internal logic levels of the TLE6251-2G.
7.5           Split Circuit
The SPLIT output pin is activated during Normal Operation mode and Receive-Only mode and deactivated
(SPLIT pin high resistive) during Sleep mode and Stand-By mode. The SPLIT pin is used to stabilize the
recessive common mode signal in Normal Operation mode and Receive-Only mode. This is realized with a
stabilized voltage of 0.5 x VCC at the SPLIT pin.

11.4          Mode Change to Sleep mode
Mode changes are applied either by a host command, an Wake-Up event or by an under-voltage event. To
trigger a mode change by a host command or in other words by a signal change on the digital input pins EN
and NSTB all power supplies, VS VIO and VCC need to be available.TLE6251-2G.
By setting the EN pin to “high” and the NSTB pin to “low”, the TLE6251-2G enters the Go-To-Sleep command
and after the time t = thSLP expires, the TLE6251-2G enters into the Sleep mode (see Chapter 5.5). For any mode
change, also for a mode change to Sleep mode the TLE6251-2G disregards the signal on the CAN bus.
Therefore the TLE6251-2G can enter Sleep mode and remain in Sleep mode even when there is a short circuit
on the CAN bus, for example CANH shorted to VS or VCC.
