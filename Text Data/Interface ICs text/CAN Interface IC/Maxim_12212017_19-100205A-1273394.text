allowing up to 2Mbps on small networks. Maximum speed
on large networks may be limited by the number of nodes
in a network, type of cabling, stub length, and other
factors. These transceivers include a dominant timeout
to prevent bus lockup caused by controller error or by
a fault on the TXD input. When TXD remains in the
dominant state (low) for longer than TDOM, the driver
is switched to the recessive state, releasing the bus.
The MAX13053A* features a S pin where it enables and
disables the transmitter for applications where you need
the transceiver to receive only. The MAX13054A features
a STBY pin for 3 modes of operation; standby mode
for low current consumption, normal high speed mode,
or a slow slew rate mode when an external 26.1kΩ is
connected between ground and STBY pin.
The MAX13053A* and MAX13054A are available in
standard 8-pin SOIC package and operate over the -40ºC
to +125ºC temperature range.

Applications Information
Reduced EMI and Reflections
In multidrop CAN applications, it is important to maintain
a single linear bus of uniform impedance that is properly
terminated at each end. A star, ring or tree configuration
should never be used. Any deviation from the end-to-end
wiring scheme creates a stub. High-speed data edges on
a stub can create reflections back down to the bus. These
reflections can cause data errors by eroding the noise
margin of the system.
Although stubs are unavoidable in a multidrop system,
care should be taken to keep these stubs as short as
possible, especially when operating with high data rates.
