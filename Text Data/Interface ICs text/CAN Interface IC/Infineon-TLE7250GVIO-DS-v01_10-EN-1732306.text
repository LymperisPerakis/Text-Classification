Description
The TLE7250GVIO is a transceiver designed for CAN networks in automotive and industrial applications. As an
interface between the physical bus layer and the CAN protocol controller, the TLE7250GVIO drives the signals to
the bus and protects the microcontroller against interferences generated within the network. Based on the high
symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE7250GVIO provides a very low level of electromagnetic
emission (EME) within a wide frequency range. The TLE7250GVIO is integrated in a RoHS-compliant PG-DSO-8
package and fulfills or exceeds the requirements of ISO11898-2.
As a successor to the first generation of HS CAN transceivers, the pin assignment and function of the
TLE7250GVIO is fully compatible with its predecessor model, the TLE6250GV33. The TLE7250GVIO is optimized
to provide an excellent passive behavior in the power-down state. This feature makes the TLE7250GVIO
extremely suitable for mixed supply CAN networks.
Based on the Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT, the TLE7250GVIO provides excellent ESD immunity
together with a very high electromagnetic immunity (EMI). The Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT allows
bipolar and CMOS control circuitry in accordance with DMOS power devices to exist on the same monolithic
circuit. The TLE7250GVIO and the Infineon SPT technology are AEC qualified and tailored to withstand the harsh
conditions of the Automotive Environment.
Two different operating modes, additional fail-safe features like TxD time-out and the optimized output slew rates
on the CANH and CANL signals make the TLE7250GVIO the ideal choice for large CAN networks with high data
transmission rates.

CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control applications.
The use of the Control Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by the international
standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model, the physical layer of a CAN bus system
specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within the network. The
physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical specifications of a CAN
network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several different physical layer standards
of CAN networks have been developed in recent years. The TLE7250GVIO is a High Speed CAN transceiver
without a dedicated wake-up function. High-speed CAN transceivers without a wake-up function are defined by
the international standard ISO 11898-2.

                                                                                                   TLE7250GVIO
                                                                                             Functional Description
The TLE7250GVIO is a High Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and
the physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two-wire, differential network, which allows data transmission
rates up to 1 Mbps. The characteristics of a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus: “dominant”
and “recessive” (see Figure 3).
The CANH and CANL pins are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as an input and output. The
RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the microcontroller. The TxD pin is the serial data input from the CAN
controller, and the RxD pin is the serial data output to the CAN controller. As shown in Figure 1, the HS CAN
transceiver TLE7250GVIO includes a receiver and a transmitter unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the
bus medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver TLE7250GVIO
converts the serial data stream available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output signal on the
CAN bus, provided by the CANH and CANL pins. The receiver stage of the TLE7250GVIO monitors the data on
the CAN bus and converts them to a serial, single-ended signal on the RxD output pin. A logical “low” signal on
the TxD pin creates a “dominant” signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “low” signal on the RxD pin (see
Figure 3). The feature of broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the CAN bus
simultaneously is essential to support the bit-to-bit arbitration within CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined by the ISO 11898-2 and the ISO 11898-5 standards.
Whether a data bit is “dominant” or “recessive” depends on the voltage difference between the CANH and CANL
pins: VDIFF = VCANH - VCANL.
In comparison with other differential network protocols, the differential signal on a CAN network can only be larger
than or equal to 0 V. To transmit a “dominant” signal to the CAN bus, the differential signal VDIFF is larger than or
equal to 1.5 V. To receive a “recessive” signal from the CAN bus, the differential VDIFF is smaller than or equal to
0.5 V.
“Partially-supplied” High Speed CAN networks are those where the CAN bus nodes of one common network have
different power supply conditions. Some nodes are connected to the common power supply, while other nodes
are disconnected from the power supply and in power-down state. Regardless of whether the CAN bus subscriber
is supplied or not, each subscriber connected to the common bus media must not interfere with the
communication. The TLE7250GVIO is designed to support “partially-supplied” networks. In the power-down state,
the receiver input resistors are switched off and the transceiver input has a high resistance.
The voltage level at the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level at the
VIO pin. Depending on the voltage level at the VIO pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (NEN, TxD and RxD) are
compatible with microcontrollers having 5 V or 3.3 V I/O supply. Usually, the VIO power supply of the transceiver
is connected to same power supply as the I/O power supply of the microcontroller.

4.2            Modes of Operation
Two different modes of operation are available on the TLE7250GVIO. Each mode has specific characteristics in
terms of quiescent current or data transmission. The digital input pin NEN is used for mode selection. Figure 4
illustrates the different mode changes depending on the status of the NEN pin. After supplying VCC and VIO to the
HS CAN transceiver, the TLE7250GVIO starts in stand-by mode. The internal pull-up resistor at the NEN pin sets
the TLE7250GVIO to stand-by mode by default. If the microcontroller is up and running, the TLE7250GVIO can
switch to any mode of operation within the time period for mode change tMode.

4.3           Normal-operating Mode
In the normal-operating mode, the HS CAN transceiver TLE7250GVIO sends the serial data stream on the TxD
pin to the CAN bus. The data on the CAN bus is displayed at the RxD pin simultaneously. In normal-operating
mode, all functions of the TLE7250GVIO are active:
•   The transmitter is active and drives data from the TxD to the CAN bus.
•   The receiver is active and provides the data from the CAN bus to the RxD pin.
•   The bus biasing is set to VCC/2.
•   The undervoltage monitoring at the power supply VCC and at the power supply VIO is active.
To enter the normal-operating mode, set the NEN pin to logical “low” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The NEN pin has
an internal pull-up resistor to the power-supply VIO.
4.4           Stand-by Mode
The stand-by mode is an idle mode of the TLE7250GVIO with optimized power consumption. In the stand-by
mode, the TLE7250GVIO can not send or receive any data. The transmitter and the receiver unit are disabled.
Both CAN bus pins, CANH and CANL are connected to GND via the input resistors.
•   The transmitter is disabled.
•   The receiver is disabled.
•   The input resistors of the receiver are connected to GND.
•   The undervoltage monitoring at the power supply VCC and at the power supply VIO is active.
To enter the stand-by mode, set the pin NEN to logical “high” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The NEN pin has an
internal pull-up resistor to the power-supply VIO. If the stand-by mode is not used in the final application, the NEN
pin needs to be connected to GND.
4.5           Power-down State
The power-down state means that the TLE7250GVIO is not supplied. In power-down state, the differential input
resistors of the receiver are switched off. The CANH and CANL bus interface of the TLE7250GVIO act as high-
impedance input with a very small leakage current. The high-ohmic input does not influence the “recessive” level
of the CAN network and allows an optimized EME performance of the entire CAN network.

5             Fail-safe Functions
5.1           Short-circuit Protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short-circuit proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damage. If the device heats up due to a continuous short
on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus transmitter.
5.2           Unconnected Logic Pins
All logic input pins have an internal pull-up resistor to VIO. In case the VIO supply is activated and the logical pins
are open or floating, the TLE7250GVIO enters the stand-by mode by default. In stand-by mode, the transmitter of
the TLE7250GVIO is disabled, the bus bias is connected to GND and the HS CAN TLE7250G transceiver does
not influence the data on the CAN bus.
5.3           TxD Time-out Function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the TxD
pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin can have its root cause in a locked-up
microcontroller or in a short on the printed circuit board for example. In the normal-operating mode, a logical “low”
signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out feature and the TLE7250GVIO disables the
transmitter (see Figure 5). The receiver is still active and the data on the bus continues to be monitored by the
RxD output pin.

Figure 5      TxD Time-out function
Figure 5 illustrates how the transmitter is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the TxD
input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter after a TxD
time-out event, the TLE7250GVIO requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to logical “high”.
5.4           Undervoltage Detection
The HS CAN transceiver TLE7250GVIO is provided with undervoltage detection at the power supply VCC and at
the power supply VIO. In case of undervoltage at VCC or VIO, the undervoltage detection changes the operating
mode of TLE7250GVIO to the stand-by mode, regardless of the logical signal on the NEN pin (see Figure 6). If
the transceiver TLE7250GVIO recovers from the undervoltage condition, the operating mode is restored to the
programmed mode by the NEN pin.

Figure 7      Overtemperature protection
The TLE7250GVIO has an integrated overtemperature detection circuit to protect the device against thermal
overstress of the transmitter. In case of an overtemperature condition, the temperature sensor will disable the
transmitter (see Figure 1). After the device cools down, the transmitter is activated again (see Figure 7).
A hysteresis is implemented within the temperature sensor.
