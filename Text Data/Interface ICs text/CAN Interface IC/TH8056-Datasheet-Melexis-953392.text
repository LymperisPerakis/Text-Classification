General Description
The TH8056 is a physical layer device for a single wire data link capable of operating with various CSMA/CR protocols
such as the Bosch Controller Area Network (CAN) version 2.0. This serial data link network is intended for use in
applications where a high data rate is not required and a lower data rate can achieve cost reductions in both the physical
media components and the microprocessor and/or dedicated logic devices that use the network.
The network shall be able to operate in either the normal data rate mode or the high-speed data download mode for
assembly line and service data transfer operations. The high-speed mode is only intended to be operational when the
bus is attached to an off-board service node. This node shall provide temporary bus electrical loads which facilitate
higher speed operation.
The bit rate for normal communications is typically 33.33kbit/s, for high-speed transmissions as described above a typical
bit rate of 83.33kbit/s is recommended. The TH8056 is designed in accordance with the Single Wire CAN Physical Layer
Specification GMW3089 V2.4 and supports many additional features like under-voltage lock-out, time-out for faulty
blocked input signals, output blanking time in case of bus ringing and a very low sleep mode current.

           The maximum signal delay time for a bus rising edge is measured from Vcmos il on the TxD input pin to the VihMax + V g off max
           level on CANH at maximum network time constant , minimum signal delay time for a bus rising edge is measured from Vcmos ih
           on the TxD input pin to 1V on CANH at minimum network time constant .These definitions are valid in both normal and HVWU
           mode
[2]
           The maximum signal delay time for a bus rising edge in HVWU mode is measured from Vcmos il on the TxD input pin to the
           VihWUMax + V g off max level on CANH at maximum network time constant, minimum signal delay time for a bus rising edge is
           measured from Vcmos ih on the TxD input pin to 1V on CANH at minimum network time constant
[3]
           Maximum signal delay time for a bus falling edge is measured from V cmos ih on the TxD input pin to 1V on CANH at maximum
           network time constant, minimum signal delay time for a bus falling edge is measured from V cmos ih on the TxD input pin to the
           VihMax + V g off max level on CANH. These definitions are valid in both normal and HVWU mode.
[4]
           The signal delay time in high-speed mode for a bus rising edge is measured from Vcmos il on the TxD input pin to the VihMax + V g
           off max level on CANH at maximum high-speed network time constant.
[5]
           The signal delay time in high-speed mode for a bus falling edge is measured from Vcmos ih on the TxD input pin to 1V on CANH
           at maximum high-speed network time constant
[6]
           Receive delay time is measured from the rising / falling edge crossing of the nominal Vih value on CANH to the falling
           (Vcmos_il_max) / rising (Vcmos_ih_min) edge of RxD. This parameter is tested by applying a square wave signal to CANH.
           The minimum slew rate for the bus rising and falling edges is 50V/us. The low level on bus is always 0V. For normal mode
           and high-speed mode testing the high level on bus is 4V. For HVWU mode testing the high level on bus is Vbat – 2V.

3. Functional Description
3.1 TxD Input pin
Logic command to transmit on the single wire CAN bus
TxD Polarity
        TxD = logic 1 (or floating) on this pin produces an undriven or recessive bus state (low bus voltage)
        TxD = logic 0 on this pin produces either a bus normal or a bus high-voltage dominant state
         depending on the transceiver mode state (high bus voltage)
If the TxD pin is driven to a logic low state while Mode 0,1 pins are in the 0,0 or sleep state, the transceiver
cannot drive the CAN Bus pin to the dominant state.
The transceiver provides an internal pull up on the TxD pin, which will cause the transmitter to default to the
bus recessive state, when TxD is not driven.
TxD input signals are standard CMOS logic levels for 3.3V and 5V supply voltages.

Time-out feature
In case of a faulty blocked dominant TxD input signal the CANH output is switched off automatically after the
specified TxD time-out reaction time to prevent a dominant bus. The transmission is continued by next TxD L
to H transition without delay.
3.2 Mode 0 and Mode 1 pins
Select transceiver operating modes
The transceiver provides a weak internal pull-down current on each of these pins, which causes the
transceiver to default to sleep mode when they are not driven. The Mode input signals are standard CMOS
logic level for 3.3V and 5V supply voltages.

Mode 0 = 0, Mode 1 = 0 – Sleep mode
Transceiver is in low-power state, waiting for wake-up via high-voltage signal or by mode pins change to any
state other than 0,0. In this state, the CAN Bus pin is not in the dominant state regardless of the state of the
TxD pin.
Mode 0 = 1, Mode 1 = 0 – High-Speed mode
This mode allows high-speed download with bitrates up to 100Kbit/s. The output waveshaping circuit is
disabled in this mode. Bus transmitters which require communicating in high-speed mode are able to drive
reduced bus resistance during this mode.
Note: High-speed mode is only allowed with connected tool resistance in parallel to the network load. Otherwise the stability of the
output signal is not guaranteed because of the slew rate enhancement for the required rise times .

Mode 0 = 0, Mode 1 = 1 – Transmit with high voltage signals to wake up remote nodes (HVWU)
This bus includes a selective node awake capability, which allows normal communication to take place
among some nodes while leaving the other nodes in an undisturbed sleep state. This is accomplished by
controlling the signal voltages such that all nodes must wake up when they receive a higher voltage
message signal waveform. The communication system communicates to the nodes information as to which
nodes are to stay operational (awake) and which nodes are to put themselves into a non-communicating
low-power “sleep” state. Communication at the lower, normal voltage levels does not disturb the sleeping
nodes.
Mode 0 = 1, Mode 1 = 1 – Normal speed and signal voltage mode
Transmission bit rate in normal communication is 33.333 Kbits/sec. In normal transmission mode the
TH8056 supports controlled waveform rise and overshoot times. Waveform trailing edge control is required
to assure that high frequency components are minimized at the beginning of the downward voltage slope.
The remaining fall time occurs after the bus is inactive with drivers off and is determined by the RC time
constant of the total bus load.
3.3 RxD Output pin
Logic data as sensed on the single wire CAN bus
RxD polarity
RxD = logic 1 on this pin indicates a bus recessive state (low bus voltage)
RxD = logic 0 on this pin indicates a bus normal or high-voltage bus dominant state
RxD in Sleep Mode
RxD does not pass signals to the micro processor while in sleep mode until a valid wake-up bus voltage level
is received or the Mode 0, 1 pins are not 0,0 respectively. When the valid wake-up bus signal awakens the
transceiver, the RxD pin signalizes an interrupt (logic 0 for dominant high-voltage signal). If there is no mode
change within the time stated, the transceiver reenters the sleep mode as described in 3.7
When not in sleep mode all valid bus signals will be sent out on the RxD pin.
RxD Typical Load
Resistance: 2.7 kohms
Capacitance: < 25 pF
3.4 Bus LOAD pin
Resistor ground with internal open-on-loss-of-ground protection
When the ECU experiences a loss of ground condition, this pin is switched to a high impedance state.
The ground connection through this pin is not interrupted in any transceiver operating mode including the
sleep mode. The ground connection is interrupted only when there is a valid loss of ground condition.
This pin provides the bus load resistor with a path to ground which contributes less than 0.1 volts to the bus
offset voltage when sinking the maximum current through one unit load resistor.

                                                   Enhanced Single Wire CAN Transceiver
The transceiver’s maximum bus leakage current contribution to Vol from the LOAD pin when in a loss of
ground state is 50 uA over all operating temperatures and 3.5 V < Vbatt < 26.5V.
3.5 Vbat INPUT pin
Vehicle Battery Voltage
The transceiver is fully operational as described in chapter 2 over the range 6V<Vbat IC<18V as measured
between the GND pin and this pin.
For 5V < Vbat IC < 6V the bus operates in normal mode with reduced dominant output voltage and reduced
receiver input voltage. High voltage wake-up call is not possible (dominant output voltage is the same as in
normal or high-speed mode).
The transceiver operates in normal mode and high-voltage wake-up mode if 18V < Vbat IC < 26.5V at 85°C for
one minute.
For 0V< Vbat IC < 4.8V, the bus is passive (not driven dominantly) and RxD is undriven (high), regardless of
the state of the TxD pin (under-voltage lock-out).
3.6 CAN BUS pin
Bus Input/Output
Wave Shaping in normal and HVWU mode
Wave shaping is incorporated into the transmitter to minimize EMI radiated emissions. An important
contributor to emissions is the rise and fall times during output transitions at the “corners” of the voltage
waveform. The resultant waveform is one half of a sine wave of frequency 50 – 65 kHz at the rising
waveform edge and one quarter of this sine wave at falling or trailing edge.
Short circuits
If the CAN BUS pin is shorted to ground for any duration of time, the current is limited to the specified value,
until an over-temperature shut-down circuit disables the output high side drive source transistor (before the
local die temperature exceeds the damage limit threshold).
Loss of ground
In case of an ECU loss of ground condition, the LOAD pin is switched into high impedance state. The CANH
transmission is continued until the under-voltage lock-out voltage threshold is detected.
Loss of battery
In case of battery loss (VBAT = 0 or open) the transceiver does not disturb bus communication. The
maximum reverse current into power supply system doesn’t exceed 500µA.
3.7 INH Pin (TH8056 KDC A only)
This Pin is a high-voltage highside switch used to control the ECU’s regulated microcontroller voltage supply.
After power-on the transceiver automatically enters an intermediate standby mode, the INH output will
become HIGH (VBAT) and therefore the external voltage regulator will provide the Vcc supply for the ECU .

                                                  Enhanced Single Wire CAN Transceiver
If there is no mode change within the time stated, the transceiver reenters the sleep mode and the INH
output goes to logic 0 (floating). When the transceiver has detected a valid wake-up condition (bus HVWU
traffic which exceeds the wake-up filter time delay) the INH output will become HIGH (VBAT) again and the
same procedure starts as described after power-on. In case of a mode change into any active mode the
sleep timer is stopped and INH keeps high (VBAT) level. If the transceiver enters the sleep mode (M0,1=0),
INH goes to logic 0 (floating) no sooner than 100ms when no wake-up signal is present.

3.9 Power Dissipation
The TH8056 has an integrated protection against thermal overload. If the junction temperature reaches the
thermal shutdown threshold the TH8056 disables the transmitter driver to reduce the power dissipation to
protect the IC itself from thermal overload. The function of the transceiver will become again available if the
junction temperate drops below the thermal recovery temperature.
To secure a stable functioning within the application and to avoid a transmitter switch off due to thermal
overload under normal operating conditions, the application must take care of the maximum power
dissipation of the IC. The junction temperature can be calculated with:
         TJ = Ta + Pd * θja
                   TJ        Junction temperature
                   Ta        Ambient temperature
                   Pd        Dissipated power
                   θja       Thermal resistance
The Junction temperature shouldn’t exceed under normal operating conditions the limit specified in chapter
2.3 Static Characteristics.
The power dissipation of an IC is the major factor determining the junction temperature. The TH8056
consumes current in different functions. A part of the supply current goes to the load and the other part
dissipates internally. The internal part has a constant passive part and an active part which depends on the
actual bus transmission. The complete internal part causes and increasing of the junction temperature.
         Ptot = PINT_a + PINT_P
                   PINT_a Internal power dissipation active

                   Ptot      Overall power dissipation
                   D         Duty cycle for data transmission
The internal passive part can be calculated with the operating voltage and the normal mode supply current
recessive. The active part can be calculated with the voltage drop of the driving transistor and the current of
the CAN bus. The active part generates only during data transmission power dissipation. Therefore the duty
cycle has to be taken into account.

                                                     Enhanced Single Wire CAN Transceiver
Assumptions:
          VBAT = 26.5V
          Rload = 6.49 kΩ
          Network with 32 nodes
          VCANH = 5.1V
          IBAT = 6mA
          D = 50%
          Ta = 125°C
          ΘJA = 70k/W (Thermally enhanced SOIC14 package)
Computations:
          Rload_net = 6.49kΩ / 32nodes = 203Ω
          Iload = 5.1V / 203Ω = 25mA
          Pload = 5.1V * 25mA * 0.5 = 64mW
          PINT_a = (26.5V – 5.1V) * 25mA * 0.5 = 267mW
          PINT_P = 26.5V * 6mA = 159mW
          Ptot = 267mW + 159mW = 426mW
          Tj = 125°C + 426mW * 70k/W = 155°C
The above calculation shows that under worst case conditions (max. operating voltage, max bus load, max
ambient temperature) the TH8056 with the thermally enhanced SOIC14 package operates below the thermal
limit. A stable functioning is possible up to these limits.
3.9.1. Thermal behaviour of TH8056 with SOIC8 – TH8056 KDC A8
The thermal impedance of an SOIC8 package is about twice in comparison to the thermally enhanced
SOIC14 package. Therefore the maximum power dissipation within this package is only about the half.
The using of the SOIC8 version of TH8056 depends on the network architecture (number of nodes), the
max. ambient temperature and the needed functionality (using of INH pin).
The following diagram shows the relationship between junction temperature, ambient temperature and
number of nodes, which have to be taken into account for using the SOIC8 version.
