The Dominant and Recessive states correspond to the
Low and High states of the TXD input pin, respectively.
However, a Dominant state initiated by another CAN
node will override a Recessive state on the CAN bus.
1.2        Receiver Function
The RXD output pin reflects the differential bus voltage
between CANH and CANL. The Low and High states of
the RXD output pin correspond to the Dominant and
Recessive states of the CAN bus, respectively.
1.3        Internal Protection
CANH and CANL are protected against battery short
circuits and electrical transients that can occur on the
CAN bus. This feature prevents destruction of the
transmitter output stage during such a fault condition.
The device is further protected from excessive current
loading by thermal shutdown circuitry that disables the
output drivers when the junction temperature exceeds
a nominal limit of +175°C.
All other parts of the chip remain operational, and the
chip temperature is lowered due to the decreased
power dissipation in the transmitter outputs. This
protection is essential to guard against bus line short-
circuit-induced damage. Thermal protection is only
active during Normal mode.

MCP2557FD/8FD
1.6        Mode Control
Figure 1-1 shows the state diagram of the MCP2557FD/
8FD.
1.6.1      UNPOWERED MODE (POR)
The MCP2557FD/8FD enters Unpowered mode if any
of the following conditions occur:
• After powering up the device
• If VDD drops below VPORL
• If VIO drops below VPORL_VIO
In Unpowered mode, the CAN bus will be biased to
ground using a high impedance. The MCP2557FD/
8FD is not able to communicate on the bus.
1.6.2      WAKE MODE
The MCP2557FD/8FD transitions from Unpowered
mode to Wake mode when VDD and VIO are above
their PORH levels. From Normal mode, if VDD is
smaller than VUVL, or if the bandgap output voltage is
not within valid range, the device will also enter Wake
mode.
In Wake mode, the CAN bus is biased to ground and
RXD is always high.
1.6.3      NORMAL MODE
When VDD exceeds VUVH, the band gap is within valid
range and TXD is High, the device transitions into
Normal mode. During POR, when the microcontroller
powers up, the TXD pin could be unintentionally pulled
down by the microcontroller powering up. To avoid
driving the bus during a POR of the microcontroller,
the transceiver proceeds to Normal mode only after
TXD is high.
In Normal mode, the driver block is operational and
can drive the bus pins. The slopes of the output
signals on CANH and CANL are optimized to reduce
Electromagnetic Emissions (EME). The CAN bus is
biased to VDD/2.
The high-speed differential receiver is active.
1.6.4        SILENT MODE
The device may be placed in Silent mode by applying
a high level to the ‘S’ pin (pin 8). In Silent mode, the
transmitter is disabled and the CAN bus is biased to
VDD/2. The high-speed differential receiver is active.
The CAN controller must put the MCP2557FD/8FD
back into Normal mode to enable the transmitter.

Silent mode.
The ‘S’ pin (pin 8) is connected to an internal MOS pull-
up resistor to VDD or VIO, in the MCP2557FD or
MCP2558FD, respectively. The value of the MOS pull-
up resistor depends on the supply voltage. Typical val-

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
