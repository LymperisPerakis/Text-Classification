                 Rev. 6 — 10 November 2017                                          Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1043 high-speed CAN transceiver provides an interface between a Controller
              Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical two-wire CAN bus. The
              transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the automotive industry,
              providing differential transmit and receive capability to (a microcontroller with) a CAN
              protocol controller.
              The TJA1043 belongs to the third generation of high-speed CAN transceivers from NXP
              Semiconductors, offering significant improvements over first- and second-generation
              devices such as the TJA1041A. It offers improved ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
              and ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) performance, very low power consumption, and
              passive behavior when the supply voltage is turned off. Advanced features include:
                • Low-power management controls the power supply throughout the node while
                   supporting local and remote wake-up with wake-up source recognition
                • Several protection and diagnostic functions including bus line short-circuit detection
                   and battery connection detection
                • Can be interfaced directly to microcontrollers with supply voltages from 3 V to 5 V
              The TJA1043 implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. This implementation enables reliable communication in the
              CAN FD fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
              These features make the TJA1043 the ideal choice for high speed CAN networks
              containing nodes that need to be available all times, even when the internal VIO and VCC
              supplies are switched off.

                       TJA1041A with improved EMC and ESD capability and quiescent current performance.
                       Improved slope control and high DC handling capability on the bus pins provide additional
                       application flexibility.
                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1043 supports five operating modes. Control pins STB_N and EN are used to
                       select the operating mode. Switching between modes allows access to a number of
                       diagnostics flags via pin ERR_N. Table 4 describes how to switch between modes.
                       Figure 4 illustrates the mode transitions when VCC, VIO and VBAT are valid.

                7.1.1 Normal mode
                      In Normal mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via the bus lines CANH
                      and CANL (see Figure 1 for the block diagram). The differential receiver converts the
                      analog data on the bus lines into digital data which is output to pin RXD. The slopes of the
                      output signals on the bus lines are controlled internally and are optimized in a way that
                      guarantees the lowest possible EME. The bus pins are biased to 0.5VCC (via Ri). Pin INH
                      is active, so voltage regulators controlled by pin INH (see Figure 9) will be active too.
                7.1.2 Listen-only mode
                      In Listen-only mode, the transceiver’s transmitter is disabled, effectively providing a
                      transceiver listen-only feature. The receiver will still convert the analog bus signal on
                      pins CANH and CANL into digital data, available for output on pin RXD. As in Normal
                      mode, the bus pins are biased at 0.5VCC and pin INH remains active.

                7.1.3 Standby mode
                       Standby mode is the TJA1043’s first-level power saving mode, offering reduced current
                       consumption. In Standby mode, the transceiver is unable to transmit or receive data and
                       the low-power receiver is activated to monitor bus activity. The bus pins are biased at
                       ground level (via Ri). Pin INH is still active, so voltage regulators controlled by this pin will
                       also be active.
                       Pins RXD and ERR_N will reflect any active wake-up requests (provided that VIO and
                       VBAT are present).
                7.1.4 Go-to-Sleep mode
                       Go-to-Sleep mode is the controlled route for entering Sleep mode. In Go-to-Sleep mode,
                       the transceiver behaves as in Standby mode, with the addition that a go-to-sleep
                       command is issued to the transceiver. The transceiver will remain in Go-to-Sleep mode for
                       the minimum hold time (th(min)) before entering Sleep mode. The transceiver will not enter
                       Sleep mode if the state of pin STB_N or pin EN is changed or if the Wake flag is set
                       before th(min) has elapsed.
                7.1.5 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode is second-level power saving mode of the TJA1043. Sleep mode is entered
                       via Go-to-Sleep mode, and also when the undervoltage detection time on either VCC or
                       VIO elapses before the relevant voltage level has recovered. In Sleep mode, the
                       transceiver behaves as described for Standby mode, with the exception that pin INH is set
                       floating. Voltage regulators controlled by this pin will be switched off, and the current into
                       pin VBAT will be reduced to a minimum. Pins STB_N, EN and the Wake flag can be used to
                       wake up a node from Sleep mode (see Table 4).
                   7.2 Internal flags
                       The TJA1043 makes use of seven internal flags for its fail-safe fallback mode control and
                       system diagnosis support. Five of these flags can be polled by the controller via pin
                       ERR_N. Which flag is available on pin ERR_N at any time depends on the active
                       operating mode and on a number of other conditions. Table 5 describes how to access
                       these flags.

                                                                                                                     when both VIO and VBAT have

                                                                                                                      resolved) or by setting the Pwon flag
                      [1]   Pin ERR_N is an active-LOW output, so a LOW-level indicates a set flag and a HIGH-level indicates a
                            cleared flag. Allow pin ERR_N to stabilize for at least 8 s after changing operating modes.
                      [2]   Allow for a TXD dominant time of at least 4 s per dominant-recessive cycle.
                7.2.1 UVNOM flag
                      UVNOM is the VCC and VIO undervoltage detection flag. The flag is set when the voltage on
                      pin VCC drops below the VCC undervoltage detection voltage, Vuvd(VCC), for longer than the
                      undervoltage detection time, tdet(uv), or when the voltage on pin VIO drops below Vuvd(VIO)
                      for longer than tdet(uv). When the UVNOM flag is set, the transceiver enters Sleep mode to
                      save power and to ensure the bus is not disturbed. In Sleep mode the voltage regulators
                      connected to pin INH are disabled, avoiding any extra power consumption that might be
                      generated as a result of a short-circuit condition.
                      Any wake-up request, setting the Pwon flag or a LOW-to-HIGH transition on STB_N will
                      clear UVNOM and the timers, allowing the voltage regulators to be reactivated (at least until
                      UVNOM is set again). UVNOM will also be cleared if both VCC and VIO recover for longer
                      than the undervoltage recovery time, trec(uv). The transceiver will then switch to the
                      operating mode indicated by the logic levels on pins STB_N and EN (see Table 4).
                7.2.2 UVBAT flag
                      UVBAT is the VBAT undervoltage detection flag. This flag is set when the voltage on
                      pin VBAT drops below Vuvd(VBAT). When UVBAT is set, the transceiver will try to enter
                      Standby mode to save power and will disengage from the bus (zero load). UVBAT is
                      cleared when the voltage on pin VBAT recovers. The transceiver will then switch to the
                      operating mode indicated by the logic levels on pins STB_N and EN (see Table 4).
                7.2.3 Pwon flag
                      Pwon is the VBAT power-on flag. This flag is set when the voltage on pin VBAT recovers
                      after previously dropping below Vuvd(VBAT) (usually because the battery was
                      disconnected). Setting the Pwon flag clears the UVNOM flag and timers. The Wake and
                      Wake-up source flags are set to ensure consistent system power-up under all supply
                      conditions. In Listen-only mode the Pwon flag can be polled via pin ERR_N (see Table 5).
                      The flag is cleared when the transceiver enters Normal mode.
                7.2.4 Wake flag
                      The Wake flag is set when the transceiver detects a local or remote wake-up request. A
                      local wake-up request is detected when the logic level on pin WAKE changes, and the
                      new level remains stable for at least twake. The Wake flag can be set in Standby mode,
                      Go-to-Sleep mode or Sleep mode. Setting the Wake flag clears the UVNOM flag and

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                         TJA1043
                                                                                                                           High-speed CAN transceiver
                           timers. Once set, the Wake flag status is immediately available on pins ERR_N and RXD
                           (provided VIO and VBAT are present). This flag is also set at power-on and cleared when
                           the UVNOM flag is set or the transceiver enters Normal mode.
                   7.2.5 Remote wake-up (via the CAN bus)
                           The TJA1043 wakes up from Standby or Sleep mode when a dedicated wake-up pattern
                           (specified in ISO 11898-2: 2016) is detected on the bus. This filtering helps avoid spurious
                           wake-up events. A spurious wake-up sequence could be triggered by, for example, a
                           dominant clamped bus or by dominant phases due to noise or spikes on the bus.
                           The wake-up pattern consists of:
                             • a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom) followed by
                             • a recessive phase of at least twake(busrec) followed by
                             • a dominant phase of at least twake(busdom)
                           Dominant or recessive bits between the above mentioned phases that are shorter than
                           twake(busdom) and twake(busrec) respectively are ignored.
                           The complete dominant-recessive-dominant pattern must be received within tto(wake)bus to
                           be recognized as a valid wake-up pattern (see Figure 5). Otherwise, the internal wake-up
                           logic is reset. The complete wake-up pattern will then need to be retransmitted to trigger a
                           wake-up event. Pin RXD remains HIGH until the wake-up event has been triggered.
                           A wake-up event is not flagged on RXD if any of the following events occurs while a valid
                           wake-up pattern is being received:
                             • The TJA1043 switches to Normal mode
                             • The complete wake-up pattern was not received within tto(wake)bus
                             • A VCC or VIO undervoltage is detected (UVNOM flag set; see Section 7.2.1)

                           the Wake flag is set by a local wake-up request via the WAKE pin. The Wake-up source
                           flag can be polled via the ERR_N pin in Normal mode (see Table 5). This flag is also set at
                           power-on and cleared when the transceiver leaves Normal mode.

                7.2.7 Bus failure flag
                       The Bus failure flag is set if the transceiver detects a bus line short-circuit condition to
                       VBAT, VCC or GND during four consecutive dominant-recessive cycles on pin TXD, while
                       trying to drive the bus lines dominant. The Bus failure flag can be polled via the ERR_N
                       pin in Normal mode (see Table 5). This flag is cleared at power-on or when the transceiver
                       re-enters Normal mode.
                7.2.8 Local failure flag
                       In Normal and Listen-only modes, the transceiver can distinguish four different local
                       failure events, any of which will cause the Local failure flag to be set. The four local failure
                       events are: TXD dominant clamping, TXD-to-RXD short circuit, bus dominant clamping
                       and an overtemperature event. The nature and detection of these local failures is
                       described in Section 7.3. The Local failure flag can be polled via the ERR_N pin in
                       Listen-only mode (see Table 5). This flag is cleared at power-on, when entering Normal
                       mode or when RXD is dominant while TXD is recessive, provided that all local failures
                       have been resolved.
                   7.3 Local failures
                       The TJA1043 can detect four different local failure conditions. Any of these failures will set
                       the Local failure flag, and in most cases the transmitter of the transceiver will be disabled.
                7.3.1 TXD dominant time-out function
                       A permanent LOW level on pin TXD (due to a hardware or software application failure)
                       would drive the CAN bus into a permanent dominant state, blocking all network
                       communications. The TXD dominant time-out function prevents such a network lock-up by
                       disabling the transmitter if pin TXD remains LOW for longer than the TXD dominant
                       time-out time tto(dom)TXD. The tto(dom)TXD timer defines the minimum possible bit rate of
                       40 kbit/s. The transmitter remains disabled until the Local failure flag has been cleared.
                7.3.2 TXD-to-RXD short-circuit detection
                       A short-circuit between pins RXD and TXD would lock the bus in a permanent dominant
                       state once it had been driven dominant, because the low-side driver of RXD is typically
                       stronger than the high-side driver of the controller connected to TXD. TXD-to-RXD
                       short-circuit detection prevents such a network lock-up by disabling the transmitter. The
                       transmitter remains disabled until the Local failure flag has been cleared.
                7.3.3 Bus dominant time-out function
                       A CAN bus short circuit (to VBAT, VCC or GND) or a failure in one of the other network
                       nodes could result in a differential voltage on the bus high enough to represent a bus
                       dominant state. Because a node will not start transmission if the bus is dominant, the
                       normal bus failure detection will not detect this failure, but the bus dominant clamping
                       detection will. The Local failure flag is set if the dominant state on the bus persists for
                       longer than tto(dom)bus. By checking this flag, the controller can determine if a clamped bus
                       is blocking network communications. There is no need to disable the transmitter. Note that
                       the Local failure flag does not retain a bus dominant clamping failure, and is released as
                       soon as the bus returns to recessive state.

                7.3.4 Overtemperature detection
                       If the junction temperature becomes excessive, the transmitter will shut down in time to
                       protect the output drivers from overheating without compromising the maximum operating
                       temperature. The transmitter will remain disabled until the Local failure flag has been
                       cleared.
                   7.4 SPLIT pin
                       Using the SPLIT pin on the TJA1043 in conjunction with a split termination network (see
                       Figure 6 and Figure 9) can help to stabilize the recessive voltage level on the bus. This
                       will reduce EME in networks with DC leakage to ground (e.g. from deactivated nodes with
                       poor bus leakage performance). In Normal and Listen-only modes, pin SPLIT delivers a
                       DC output voltage of 0.5VCC. In Standby, Go-to-Sleep and Sleep modes, pin SPLIT is
                       floating.

                   7.5 VIO supply pin
                       Pin VIO should be connected to the microcontroller supply voltage (see Figure 9). This will
                       cause the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD, STB_N, EN and ERR_N to be adjusted to the
                       I/O levels of the microcontroller, facilitating direct interfacing without the need for glue
                       logic.
                   7.6 WAKE pin
                       A local wake-up event is triggered by a LOW-to-HIGH or HIGH-to-LOW transition on the
                       WAKE pin, allowing for maximum flexibility when designing a local wake-up circuit.To
                       minimize current consumption, the internal bias voltage will follow the logic state on the
                       pin after a delay of twake. A HIGH level on pin WAKE is followed by an internal pull-up to
                       VBAT. A LOW level on pin WAKE is followed by an internal pull-down towards GND. In
                       applications that don’t make use of the local wake-up facility, it is recommended that the
                       WAKE pin be connected to VBAT or GND to ensure optimal EMI performance.

                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 15) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 10 and 11

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 15.
