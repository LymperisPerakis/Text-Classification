             Note:   The bit time of a recessive bit after five dominant bits is measured on the RXD pin. Due
                     to asymmetry of the loop delay, and the CAN transceiver not being a push pull driver,
                     the recessive bits tend to shorten.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
