General Description                                             Benefits and Features
The MAX13050/MAX13052/MAX13053/MAX13054 are                     ●● Fully Compatible with the ISO11898 Standard
pin-for-pin compatible, industry-standard, high-speed, control  ●● ±8kV ESD IEC 61000-4-2 Contact Discharge per
area network (CAN) transceivers with extended ±80V fault            IBEE Test Facility
protection. These products are ideal industrial network
applications where overvoltage protection is required.          ●● ±80V Fault Protection
These CAN transceivers provide a link between the CAN           ●● +3.3V Logic Compatible (MAX13054)
protocol controller and the physical wires of the bus lines     ●● High-Speed Operation of Up to 1Mbps
in a CAN. These devices can be used for DeviceNet®
                                                                ●● Slope-Control Mode (MAX13052)

                                                                ●● Short-Circuit Protection
function that prevents erroneous CAN controllers from
clamping the bus to a dominant level if the TXD input is        ●● Transmit (TXD) Data Dominant Timeout
held low for greater than 1ms. The MAX13050/MAX13052            ●● Current Limiting

slope-control mode that can be used to program the slew         Applications
rate of the transmitter for data rates of up to 500kbps.
                                                                ●● DeviceNet Nodes
The MAX13053 features a silent mode that disables the
                                                                ●● Medium- and Heavy-Duty Truck Systems
transmitter. The MAX13053 also has a reference output
                                                                ●● Industrial
that can be used to bias the input of older CAN controllers
that have a differential comparator. The MAX13054 has a
separate dedicated logic input (VCC2) allowing interfacing
with a +3.3V microcontroller.
