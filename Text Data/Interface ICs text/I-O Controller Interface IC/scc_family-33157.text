          Setting the standards for SCCs
          Over the last 20 years ZiLOG has set the standard for
          SCCs. Built from the industry acclaimed Serial
          Communication Controller core, ZiLOG offers a wide
          selection of (SCCs) based on your application require-
          ments.
          Reducing the need for external logic
          ZiLOG’s SCCs offer low power consumption, higher per-
          formance, and superior noise immunity. The many
          on-chip features offered in our SCCs help dramatically to   • Ability to accommodate a crystal oscillator,
          reduce the need for external logic found with much of the     baud rate generator, and digital phase-locked
          competition. Go with an SCC you can trust, and make           loop on each channel

          Simplifying software
          The enhanced dual and mono SCCs Z80230, Z85230, and
          Z85233, include many features that make programming
          easy. These parts also reduce CPU overhead, allowing the
          programmer to select packet handling response and
          improve cycle access recovery time. Features include:
          • Dual full-duplex channels (Z80230/Z85230)
          • Single full-duplex channel (Z85233 only)
