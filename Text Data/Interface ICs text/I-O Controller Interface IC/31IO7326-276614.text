DEBOUNCED 8×8 KEY-SCAN CONTROLLER
                                                                                                                  January 2012
GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                   FEATURES
The IS31IO7326 is a 64 key, key-scan controller. It                         2.4V to 5.5V operation
offloads the burden of keyboard scanning from the host                      400kHz I2C serial interface
processor. The IS31IO7326 supports keypad matrix of                         Available for multi-key press detect
up to 8×8. Key press and release events are encoded
                                                                            Low 0.3μA (typ.) standby current
into a byte format and loaded into a key event register
for retrieval by the host processor.                                        Operate in -40°C to +125°C
                                                                            Pb-free 4mm × 4mm QFN-24 package
The IS31IO7326 integrates a debounce function which
rejects false or transient key switch activities. The
                   _______
interrupt output (INT) is used to signify if there are any            APPLICATIONS
keypad activities.
                                                                            Keypad of QWERTY type phones
To minimize power, the IS31IO7326 automatically
                                                                            PDAs, games, and other handheld applications
enters a low power standby mode when there is no
keypad, I/O, or host activity.
The IS31IO7326 is available in a Pb-free 4mm × 4mm
QFN-24 package.

1. If the key PP1-OD3 pressed only, and other keys keep released state, the INT asserts, the data in Key Status
     Register would be “0101 1001”;
                                                                                             _______
2. If the key PP4-OD6 released only, and other keys keep released state, the INT asserts, the data in Key Status
     Register would be “0011 0100”;
                                                                                                  _______
3. If the key PP2-OD4 and PP3-OD7 are pressing, then PP2-OD4 released, the INT asserts, the first data in Key
     Status Register would be “1010 0010”, the second data would be “0111 1011”. Then judge the MSB (bit DN) in
                                                                 _______
     the second data is “0”. Data has read over, and INT goes to high.
                                                             _______
We must read over the data in Key Status Register when the I N T asserts. When judge the MSB (bit DN) in the data is “0”, stop reading the
Key Status Register. If there are some keys connected to the same OD port pressing at the same time, IS31IO7326 only can detect the first
pressed key and others will ignore.
