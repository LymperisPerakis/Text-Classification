General Description
              Zilog’s Z16C30 USC Universal Serial Controller is a dual-channel multi-protocol data
              communications peripheral designed for use with any conventional multiplexed or non-
              multiplexed bus. The USC functions as a serial-to-parallel, parallel-to-serial converter/
              controller and may be software configured to satisfy a wide variety of serial communica-
              tions applications. The device contains a variety of new, sophisticated internal functions
              including two baud rate generators per channel, one digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) per
              channel, character counters for both receive and transmit in each channel and 32-byte data
              FIFO’s for each receiver and transmitter (Figure 1 on page 3).
              Zilog now offers a high speed version of the USC with improved bus bandwidth. CPU bus
              accesses have been shortened from 160 ns per access to 110 ns per access. The USC has a
              transmit and receive clock range of up to 10 MHz (20 MHz when using the DPLL, BRG,
              or CTR) and data transfer rates as high as 10 Mbits/sec full duplex.
              The USC handles asynchronous formats, synchronous byte-oriented formats such as
              BISYNC, and synchronous bit-oriented formats such as HDLC. This device supports vir-
              tually any serial data transfer application.
              The device can generate and check CRC in any synchronous mode and can be pro-
              grammed to check data integrity in various modes. The USC also has facilities for modem
              controls in both channels. In applications where these controls are not needed, the modem
              controls may be used for general-purpose I/O (GPIO). The same is true for most of the
              other pins in each channel.
              Interrupts are supported with a daisy-chain hierarchy, with the two channels having com-
              pletely separate interrupt structures.
              High-speed data transfers through DMA are supported by a Request/Acknowledge signal
              pair for each receiver and transmitter. The device supports automatic status transfer
              through DMA and also allows device initialization under DMA control.
     Note:       When written to, all reserved bits must be programmed to 0.
              To aid in efficiently programming the USC, support tools are available. The Technical
              Manual describes in detail all features presented in this Product Specification and gives
              programming sequence hints. The Programmer’s Assistant is a MS-DOS disk-based pro-
              gramming initialization tool to be used in conjunction with the Technical Manual. There
              are also available assorted application notes and development boards to assist in the hard-
              ware/software development.
              All Signals with an overline, are active Low. For example: B/W, in which WORD is active
              Low, and B/W, in which BYTE is active Low.
              Power connections follow these conventional descriptions:

                The Z16C30 contains 13 pins per channel for channel I/O, 16 pins for address and data, 12
                pins for CPU handshake, and 14 pins for power and ground.
                Three separate bus interface types are available for the device. The Bus Configuration
                Register (BCR) and external connections to the AD bus control selection of the bus type.
                A 16-bit bus is selected by setting BCR bit 2 to a 1. The 8-bit bus is selected by setting
                BCR bit 2 to 0 and tying AD15–AD8 to VSS.

                                                                                                              7
              The 8-bit bus with separate address is selected by setting BCR bit 2 to 0 and, during the
              BCR write, forcing AD15 to a 1 and forcing AD14–AD8 to 0.
              The multiplexed bus is selected for the USC if there is an Address Strobe prior to or during
              the transaction which writes the BCR. If no Address Strobe is present prior to or during
              the transaction which writes the BCR, a nonmultiplexed bus is selected (see Figure 29 on
              page 49).
       Pin Functions
              RESET Reset (input, active Low)—This signal resets the device to a known state. The
              first write to the USC after a reset accesses the BCR to select additional bus options for the
              device.
              AS Address Strobe (input, active Low)—This signal is used in the multiplexed bus
              modes to latch the address on the AD lines. The AS signal is not used in the nonmulti-
              plexed bus modes and should be tied to VDD.
              DS Data Strobe (input, active Low)—This signal strobes data out of the device during a
              read and may strobe an interrupt vector out of the device during an interrupt acknowledge
              cycle. DS also strobes data into the device on the state of R/W.
              RD Read Strobe (input, active Low)—This signal strobes data out of the device during a
              read and may strobe an interrupt vector out of the device during an interrupt acknowledge
              cycle.
              WR Write Strobe (input, active Low)—This signal strobes data into the device during a
              write.
              R/W Read/Write (input)—This signal determines the direction of data transfer for a read
              or write cycle in conjunction with DS.
              CS Chip Select (input, active Low)—This signal selects the device for access and must
              be asserted for read and write cycles, but is ignored during interrupt acknowledge and fly-
              by DMA transfers. In the case of a multiplexed bus interface, CS is latched by the rising
              edge of AS.
              A/B Channel A/Channel B Select (input)—This signal selects between the two channels
              in the device. High selects channel A and Low selects channel B. This signal is sampled
              and the result is latched during the BCR (Bus Configuration Register) write. It programs
              the sense of the WAIT/RDY signal appropriate for different bus interfaces.
              D/C Data/Control Select (input)—This signal, when High, provides for direct access to
              the RDR and TDR. In the case of a multiplexed bus interface, D/C High overrides the
              address provided to the device.
              SITACK Status Interrupt Acknowledge (input, active Low)—This signal is a status sig-
              nal that indicates that an interrupt acknowledge cycle is in progress. The device is capable
              of returning an interrupt vector that may be encoded with the type of interrupt pending
              during this acknowledge cycle. This signal is compatible with 680X0 family microproces-
              sors.

                                                                                 Product Specification
                                                                                                              8
              PITACK Pulsed Interrupt Acknowledge (input, active Low)—This signal is a strobe
              signal that indicates that an interrupt acknowledge cycle is in progress. The device is capa-
              ble of returning an interrupt vector that may be encoded with the type of interrupt pending
              during this acknowledge cycle. PITACK may be programmed to accept a single pulse or
              double pulse acknowledge type. This programming is done in the BCR. With the double
              pulse type selected, the first PITACK is recognized but no action takes place. The interrupt
              vector is returned on the second pulse if the no vector option is not selected. The double
              pulse type is compatible with 8X86 family microprocessors.
              WAIT/RDY Wait/Data Ready (output, active Low)—This signal serves to indicate when
              the data is available during a read cycle, when the device is ready to receive data during a
              write cycle, and when a valid vector is available during an interrupt acknowledge cycle. It
              may be programmed to function either as a Wait signal or a Ready signal using the state of
              the A/B pin during the BCR write. When A/B is High during the BCR write, this signal
              functions as a wait output and thus supports the READY function of 8X86 family micro-
              processors. When A/B is Low during the BCR write, this signal functions as a ready out-
              put and thus supports the DTACK function of 680X0 family microprocessors.
              AD15–AD0 Address/Data Bus (bidirectional, active High, tri-state)—The AD signals
              carry addresses to, and data to and from, the device. When the 16-bit nonmultiplexed bus
              is selected, AD15–AD0 carry data to and from the device. Addresses are provided using a
              pointer within the device that is loaded with the desired register address. When selecting
              the 8-bit nonmultiplexed bus (without separate address) only AD7–AD0 are used to trans-
              fer data. The pointer is used for addressing, with AD15–AD8 unused. When selecting the
              8-bit nonmultiplexed bus (with separate address), AD7–AD0 are used to transfer data with
              AD15–AD8 used as address bus. When the 16-bit multiplexed bus is selected, addresses
              are latched from AD7–AD0 and data transfers are sixteen bits wide. When selecting the 8-
              bit multiplexed bus (without separate address) only AD7–AD0 are used to transfer
              addresses and data, with AD15–AD8 unused. When the 8-bit multiplexed bus with sepa-
              rate address is selected, only AD7–AD0 are used to transfer data, while AD15–AD8 are
              used as an address bus.
              INTA, INTB Interrupt Request (outputs, active Low)—These signals indicate that the
              channel has an interrupt condition pending and is requesting service. These outputs are
              NOT open-drain.
              IEIA, IEIB Interrupt Enable In (inputs, active High)—The IEI signal for each channel is
              used with the accompanying IEO signal to form an interrupt daisy chain. An active IEI
              indicates that no device having higher priority is requesting or servicing an interrupt.
              IEOA, IEOB Interrupt Enable Out (outputs, active High)—The IEO signal for each
              channel is used with the accompanying IEI signal to form an interrupt daisy chain. IEO is
              Low if IEI is Low, an interrupt is under service in the channel, or an interrupt is pending
              during an interrupt acknowledge cycle.
              TxACKA, TxACKB Transmit Acknowledge (inputs or outputs, active Low)—The pri-
              mary function of these signals is to perform fly-by DMA transfers to the transmit FIFOs.
              They may also be used as bit inputs or outputs.

              RxACKA, RxACKB Receive Acknowledge (inputs or outputs, active Low)—The pri-
              mary function of these signals is to perform fly-by DMA transfers from the receive FIFOs.
              They may also be used as bit inputs or outputs.
              TxDA, TxDB Transmit Data (outputs, active High, tri-state)—These signals carry the
              serial transmit data for each channel.
              RxDA, RxDB Receive Data (inputs, active High)—These signals carry the serial receive
              data for each channel.
              TxCA, TxCB Transmit Clock (inputs or outputs, active Low)—These signals are used
              as clock inputs for any of the functional blocks within the device. They may also be used
              as outputs for various transmitter signals or internal clock signals.
              RxCA, RxCB Receive Clock (inputs or outputs, active Low)—These signals are used
              as clock inputs for any of the functional blocks within the device. They may also be used
              as outputs for various receiver signals or internal clock signals.
              TxREQA, TxREQB Transmit Request (inputs or outputs, active Low)—The primary
              function of these signals is to request DMA transfers to the transmit FIFOs. They may also
              be used as simple inputs or outputs.
              RxREQA, RxREQB Receive Request (inputs or outputs, active Low)—The primary
              function of these signals is to request DMA transfers from the receive FIFOs. They may
              also be used as simple inputs or outputs.
              CTSA, CTSB Clear To Send (inputs or outputs, active Low)—These signals are used
              as enables for the respective transmitters. They may also be programmed to generate inter-
              rupts on either transition or used as simple inputs or outputs.
              DCDA, DCDB Data Carrier Detect (inputs or outputs, active Low)—These signals are
              used as enables for the respective receivers. They may also be programmed to generate
              interrupts on either transition or used as simple inputs or outputs.

Notes
   1. Direct address is any of A/B, D/C, or AD15–AD8 used as an address bus.
   2. The parameter applies only when AS is not present.
   3. Strobe (STB) is any of DS, RD, WR, PITACK, RxACK or TxACK.
   4. Parameter applies only if read empties the receive FIFO.
   5. Parameter applies only if write fills the transmit FIFO.
   6. For extended temperature part TdDSI(Wf) max = 220 ns.
   7. For extended temperature part TdDSF(TRQ) max = 75 ns.
         USC Timing
                    The USC interface timing is similar to that found on a static RAM, except that it is much
                    more flexible. Up to eight separate timing strobe signals may be present on the interface:
                    DS, RD, WR, PITACK, RxACKA, RxACKB, TxACKA, and TxACKB. Only one of
                    these timing strobes may be active at any time. Should the external logic activate more
                    than one of these strobes at the same time the USC will enter a pre-reset state that is only
                    exited by a hardware reset. Do not allow overlap of timing strobes. The timing diagrams
                    beginning on the next page illustrate the different bus transactions possible with the neces-
                    sary setup hold and delay times.

        Architecture
                 The USC internal structure includes two completely independent full-duplex serial chan-
                 nels, each with two baud rate generators, a digital phase-locked loop for clock recovery,
                 transmit and receive character counters and a full-duplex DMA interface. The two serial
                 channels share a common bus interface. The bus interface is designed to provide easy
                 interface to most microprocessors, whether they employ a multiplexed or nonmultiplexed,
                 8-bit or16-bit bus structure. Each channel is controlled by a set of thirty 16-bit registers,
                 nearly all of which are readable and writable. There is one additional 16-bit register in the
                 bus interface used to configure the nature of the bus interface. The BCR functions are
                 shown as follows:

Data Path
                   Both the transmitter and the receiver in the channel are actually microcoded serial proces-
                   sors. As the data shifts through the transmit or receive shift register, the microcode
                   watches for specific bit patterns, counts bits, and at the appropriate time transfers data to
                   or from the FIFOs. The microcode also checks status and generates status interrupts as
                   appropriate.

Functional Description
              The functional capabilities of the USC are described from two different points of view: as
              a data communications device, it transmits and receives data in a wide variety of data
              communications protocols; as a microprocessor peripheral, the USC offers such features
              as read/write registers, a flexible bus interface, DMA interface support, and vectored inter-
              rupts.
       Data Communications Capabilities
              The USC provides two independent full-duplex channels programmable for use in any
              common data communication protocol. The receiver and transmitter modes are com-
              pletely independent, as are the two channels. Each receiver and transmitter is supported by
              a 32-byte deep FIFO and a 16-bit message length counter. All modes allow optional even,
              odd, mark or space parity. Synchronous modes allow the choice of two 16-bit or one 32-bit
              CRC polynomial. Selection of from one to eight bits-per-character is available in both
              receiver and transmitter, independently. Error and status conditions are carried with the
              data in the receive and transmit FIFOs to greatly reduce the CPU overhead required to
              send or receive a message. Specific, appropriately timed interrupts are available to signal
              such conditions as overrun, parity error, framing error, end-of-frame, idle line received,
              sync acquired, transmit underrun, CRC sent, closing sync/flag sent, abort sent, idle line
              sent, and preamble sent. In addition, several useful internal signals such as receive FIFO
              load, received sync, transmit FIFO read and transmission complete may be sent to pins for
              use by external circuitry.
              Asynchronous Mode—The receiver and transmitter can handle data at a rate of 1/16, 1/
              32, or 1/64 the clock rate. The receiver rejects start bits less than one-half a bit time and
              will not erroneously assemble characters following a framing error. The transmitter is
              capable of sending one, two, or anywhere in the range of 1/16 to two stop bits per charac-
              ter in 1/16 bit increments.
              External Sync Mode—The receiver is synchronized to the receive data stream by an
              externally-supplied signal on a pin for custom protocol applications.
              Isochronous Mode—Both transmitter and receiver may operate on start-stop (async) data
              using a 1x clock. The transmitter can send one or two stop bits.
              Asynchronous With Code Violations—This is similar to Isochronous mode except that
              the start bit is replaced by a three bit-time code violation pattern as in MIL-STD 1553B.
              The transmitter can send zero, one or two stop bits.
              Monosync Mode—In this mode, a single character is used for synchronization. The sync
              character can be either eight bits long with an arbitrary data character length, or pro-
              grammed to match the data character length. The receiver is capable of automatically
              stripping sync characters from the received data stream. The transmitter may be pro-

                                                                                                    Z16C30
                                                                                  Product Specification
                                                                                                               42
              grammed to automatically send CRC on either an underrun or at the end of a programmed
              message length.
              Bisync Mode—This mode is identical to monosync mode except that character synchroni-
              zation requires two successive characters for synchronization. The two characters need not
              be identical.
              HDLC Mode—In this mode, the receiver recognizes flags, performs optional address
              matching, accommodates extended address fields, 8- or 16-bit control fields and logical
              control fields, performs zero deletion and CRC checking. The receiver is capable of
              receiving shared-zero flags, recognizes the abort sequence and can receive arbitrary length
              messages. The transmitter automatically sends opening and closing flags, performs zero
              insertion and can be programmed to send an abort, an extended abort, a flag or CRC, and a
              flag on transmit underrun. The transmitter can also automatically send the closing flag
              with optional CRC at the end of a programmed message length. Shared-zero flags are
              selected in the transmitter and a separate character length may be programmed for the last
              character in the frame.
              Bisync Transparent Mode—In this mode, the synchronization pattern is DLE–SYN, pro-
              grammable selected from either ASCII or EBCDIC encoding. The receiver recognizes
              control character sequences and automatically handles CRC calculation without CPU
              intervention. The transmitter can be programmed to send either SYN, DLE–SYN, CRC–
              SYN, or CRC–DLE–SYN upon underrun and can automatically send the closing DLE–
              SYN with optional CRC at the end of a programmed message length.
              NBIP Mode—This mode is identical to async except that the receiver checks for the status
              of an additional address/data bit between the parity bit and the stop bit. The value of this
              bit is FIFO’ed along with the data. This bit is automatically inserted in the transmitter with
              the value that is FIFO’ed with the transmit data.
              802.3 Mode—This mode implements the data format of IEEE 802.3 with 16-bit address
              compare. In this mode, DCD and CTS are used to implement the carrier sense and colli-
              sion detect interactions with the receiver and transmitter.
              Slaved Monosync Mode—This mode is available only in the transmitter and allows the
              transmitter (operating as though it were in monosync mode) to send data that is byte-syn-
              chronous to the data being received by the receiver.
              HDLC Loop Mode—This mode is also available only in the transmitter and allows the
              USC to be used in an HDLC loop configuration. In this mode, the receiver is programmed
              to operate in HDLC mode so that the transmitter echoes received messages. Upon receipt
              of a particular bit pattern (actually a sequence of seven consecutive ones) the transmitter
              breaks the loop and inserts its own frame(s).
       Data Encoding
              The USC may be programmed to encode and decode the serial data in any of eight differ-
              ent ways as displayed in Figure 28 on page 44. The transmitter encoding method is
              selected independently of the receiver decoding method.

              Biphase-Mark—In Biphase-Mark, a 1 is represented by a transition at the beginning of the
              bit cell and another transition at the center of the bit cell. A 0 is represented by a transition
              at the beginning of the bit cell only.
              Biphase-Space—In Biphase-Space, a 1 is represented by a transition at the beginning of
              the bit cell only. A 0 is represented by a transition at the beginning of the bit cell and
              another transition at the center of the bit cell.
              Biphase-Level—In Biphase-Level, a 1 is represented by a High during the first half of the
              bit cell and a Low during the second half of the bit cell. A 0 is represented by a Low dur-
              ing the first half of the bit cell and a High during the second half of the bit cell.

                Differential Biphase-Level—In Differential Biphase-Level, a 1 is represented by a transi-
                tion at the center of the bit cell, with the opposite polarity from the transition at the center
                of the preceding bit cell. A 0 is represented by a transition at the center of the bit cell with
                the same polarity as the transition at the center of the preceding bit cell. In both cases there
                may be transitions at the beginning of the bit cell to set up the level required to make the
                correct center transition.
       Character Counters
                Each channel in the USC contains a 16-bit character counter for both receiver and trans-
                mitter. The receive character counter may be preset either under software control or auto-
                matically at the beginning of a receive message. The counter decrements with each receive
                character and at the end of the receive message the current value in the counter is automat-

                                                                                                      Z16C30
                                                                                    Product Specification
                                                                                                                 45
              ically loaded into a four-deep FIFO. This allows DMA transfer of data to proceed without
              CPU intervention at the end of a received message, as the values in the FIFO allow the
              CPU to determine message boundaries in memory. Similarly, the transmit character
              counter is loaded either under software control or automatically at the beginning of a
              transmit message. The counter is decremented with each write to the transmit FIFO. When
              the counter has decremented to 0, and that byte is sent, the transmitter automatically termi-
              nates the message in the appropriate fashion (usually CRC and the closing flag or sync
              character) without requiring CPU intervention.
       Baud Rate Generators
              Each channel in the USC contains two baud rate generators. Each generator consists of a
              16-bit time constant register and a 16-bit down counter. In operation, the counter decre-
              ments with each baud rate generator clock, with the time constant automatically reloaded
              when the count reaches zero. The output of the baud rate generator toggles when the
              counter reaches a count of one-half of the time constant and again when the counter
              reaches zero.A new time constant may be written at any time but the new value will not
              take effect until the next load of the counter. The outputs of both baud rate generators are
              sent to the clock multiplexer for use internally or externally. The baud rate generator out-
              put frequency is related to the baud rate generator input clock frequency by the following
              equation:
              Output frequency = Input frequency/(time constant + 1)
              This allows an output frequency in the range of 1 to 1/65536 of the input frequency, inclu-
              sive.
       Digital Phase-Locked Loop
              Each channel in the USC contains a Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) to recover clock
              information from a data stream with NRZI or Biphase encoding. The DPLL is driven by a
              clock that is nominally 8, 16 or 32 times the receive data rate. The DPLL uses this clock,
              along the data stream, to construct a clock for the data. This clock may then be routed to
              the receiver, transmitter, or both, or to a pin for use externally. In all modes, the DPLL
              counts the input clock to create nominal bit times. As the clock is counted, the DPLL
              watches the incoming data stream for transitions. Whenever a transition is detected, the
              DPLL makes a count adjustment (during the next counting cycle), to produce an output
              clock which tracks the incoming bit cells. The DPLL provides properly phased transmit
              and receive clocks to the clock multiplexer.
       Counters
              Each channel contains two 5-bit counters, which are programmed to divide an input clock
              by 4, 8, 16, or 32. The inputs of these two counters are sent to the clock multiplexer. The
              counters are used as prescalers for the baud rate generators, or to provide a stable transmit
              clock from a common source when the DPLL is providing the receive clock.

       Clock Multiplexer
              The clock multiplexer in each channel selects the clock source for the various blocks in the
              channel and selects an internal clock signal to potentially be sent to either the RxC or TxC
              pin.
       Test Modes
              The USC can be programmed for local loopback or auto echo operation. In local loopback,
              the output of the transmitter is internally routed to the input of the receiver. This allows
              testing of the USC data paths without any external logic. Auto echo connects the RxD pin
              directly to the TxD pin. This is useful for testing serial links external to the USC.
I/O Interface Capabilities
              The USC offers the choice of polling, interrupt (vectored or nonvectored) and block trans-
              fer modes to transfer data, status and control information to and from the CPU.
       Polling
               All interrupts are disabled. The registers in the USC are automatically updated to reflect
              current status. The CPU polls the Daisy Chain Control Register (DCCR) to determine sta-
              tus changes and then reads the appropriate status register to find and respond to the change
              in status. USC status bits are grouped according to function to simplify this software
              action.
       Interrupt
              When a USC responds to an interrupt acknowledge from the CPU, an interrupt vector may
              be placed on the data bus. This vector is held in the Interrupt Vector Register (IVR). To
              speed interrupt response time, the USC modifies three bits in this vector to indicate which
              type of interrupt is being requested.
              Each of the six sources of interrupts in each channel of the USC (Receive Status, Receive
              Data, Transmit Status, Transmit Data, I/O Status, and Device Status) has three bits associ-
              ated with the interrupt source: Interrupt Pending (IP), Interrupt-Under-Service (IUS), and
              Interrupt Enable (IE). If the IE bit for a given source is set, that source can request inter-
              rupts. Note that individual sources within the six groups also have interrupt enable bits
              which are set for the particular source. In addition, there is a Master Interrupt Enable
              (MIE) bit in each channel which globally enables or disables interrupts within the channel.
              The other two bits are related to the interrupt priority chain. A channel in the USC may
              request an interrupt only when no higher priority interrupt source is requesting one, e.g.,
              when IEI is High for the channel. In this case the channel activates the INT signal. The
              CPU then responds with an interrupt acknowledge cycle, and the interrupting channel

                                                                                   Product Specification
                                                                                                                47
              In the USC, the IP bit signals that an interrupt request is being serviced. If an IUS is set, all
              interrupt sources of lower priority within the channel and external to the channel are pre-
              vented from requesting interrupts. The internal interrupt sources are inhibited by the state
              of the internal daisy chain, while lower priority devices are inhibited by the IEO output of
              the channel being pulled Low and propagated to subsequent peripherals. An IUS bit is set
              during an interrupt acknowledge cycle if there are no higher priority devices requesting
              interrupts.
              There are six sources of interrupt in each channel: Receive Status, Receive Data, Transmit
              Status, Transmit Data, I/O Status, and Device Status, prioritized in that order within the
              channel. There are six sources of Receive Status interrupt, each individually enabled:
              exited hunt, idle line, break/abort, code violation/end-of-transmission/end-of-frame, parity
              error, and overrun error. The Receive Data interrupt is generated whenever the receive
              FIFO fills with data beyond the level programmed in the Receive Interrupt Control Regis-
              ter (RICR).
              There are six sources of Transmit Status interrupt, each individually enabled: preamble
              sent, idle line sent, abort sent, end-of-frame/end-of-transmission sent, CRC sent, and
              underrun error. The Transmit Data interrupt is generated whenever the transmit FIFO
              empties below the level programmed in the Transmit Interrupt Control Register (TICR).
              The I/O Status interrupt serves to report transitions on any of six pins. Interrupts are gener-
              ated on either or both edges with separate selection and enables for each pin. The pins pro-
              grammed to generate I/O Status interrupts are RxC, TxC, RxREQ, TxREQ, DCD, and
              CTS. These interrupts are independent of the programmed function of the pins. The
              Device Status interrupt has four separately enabled sources: receive character count FIFO
              overflow, DPLL sync acquired, BRG1 zero count, and BRGO zero count.
       Block Transfer Mode
              The USC accommodates block transfers through DMA through the RxREQ, TxREQ,
              RxACK, and TxACK pins. The RxREQ signal is activated when the fill level of the
              receive FIFO exceeds the value programmed in the RICR. The DMA may respond with
              either a normal bus transaction or by activating the RxACK pin to read the data directly
              (fly-by transfer). The TxREQ signal is activated when the empty level of the transmit
              FIFO falls below the value programmed in the TICR. The DMA may respond either with a
              normal bus transaction or by activating the TxACK pin to write the data directly (fly-by
              transfer). The RxACK and TxACK pin functions for this mode are controlled by the Hard-
              ware Configuration Register (HCR). Then using the RxACK and TxACK pins to transfer
              data, no chip select is necessary; these are dedicated strobes for the appropriate FIFO.
Programming
              The registers in each USC channel are programmed by the system to configure the chan-
              nels. Before this can occur, however, the system must program the bus interface by writing
              to the Bus Configuration Register (BCR). The BCR has no specific address and is only

                                                                                                   Z16C30
                                                                                  Product Specification
                                                                                                              48
              accessible immediately after a hardware reset of the device. The first write to the USC,
              after a hardware reset, programs the BCR. From that time on, the normal channel registers
              may be accessed. No specific address need be presented to the USC for the BCR write
              because the first write after a hardware reset is automatically programmed for the BCR.
              In the multiplexed bus case, all registers are directly addressable through the address
              latched by AS at the beginning of a bus transaction. The address is decoded from either
              AD6–AD0 or AD7–AD1. This is controlled by the Shift Right/Shift Left bit in the BCR.
              The address maps for these two cases are listed in Table 8. The D/C pin is still used to
              directly access the receive and transmit data registers (RDR and TDR) in the multiplexed
              bus; if D/C is High the address latched by AS is ignored and an access of RDR or TDR is
              performed.
              In the nonmultiplexed bus case, the registers in each channel are accessed indirectly using
              the address pointer in the Channel Command/Address Register (CCAR) in each channel.
              The address of the desired register is first written to the CCAR and then the selected regis-
              ter is accessed; the pointer in the CCAR is automatically cleared after this access. The
              RDR and TDR are accessed directly using the D/C pin, without disturbing the contents of
              the pointer in the CCAR.

     Notes:   1. The Channel Reset bit in the CCAR places the channel in the reset state. To exit this
                  reset state either a word of all zeros must be written to the CCAR (16-bit bus), or a byte
                  of all zeros must be written to the lower byte of the CCAR (8-bit bus).
              2. After reset, the transmit and receive clocks are not connected. The first thing that
                  should be done in any initialization sequence is a write to the Clock Mode Control
                  Register (CMCR) to select a clock source for the receiver and transmitter.
              The register addressing is listed in Table 9 on page 50 while the bit assignments for the
              registers are displayed in Figure 29.
