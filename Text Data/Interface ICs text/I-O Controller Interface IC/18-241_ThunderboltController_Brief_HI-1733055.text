Thunderbolt™ 3: The USB-C That Does It All
Thunderbolt™ 3 delivers a single cable, multi-purpose I/O solution at speeds up to 40 Gbps, creating one
compact port that does it all – delivering today’s fastest,1 most versatile connection to any dock, display,
or data device. With Thunderbolt 3, one computer port connects to Thunderbolt devices, every display, and
billions of USB devices. A single cable now provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of
any other solution, while also supplying power. It’s unrivaled for new uses, such as single-cable docks with
charging, docking displays, super-fast storage, external graphics, and 10 GbE networking. Simply put,
Thunderbolt 3 delivers the best USB-C.
Thunderbolt Overview
Fundamentally, Thunderbolt is a tunneling architecture designed to combine underlying protocols onto
a single interface so that the total speed and performance of the link can be shared between the usages
of these protocols allowing Thunderbolt 3 to deliver data, display, and power all over a single cable.
Thunderbolt 3 provides more protocols, more speed, more pixels, and more power.


2 TECHNOLOGY BRIEF
The Thunderbolt controller provides several important features.            There are three components in the Intel® 6000 Series Thunderbolt™ 3
It includes a physical interface (PHY) layer that can dynamically          controller family. These block diagrams showcase their use in
switch operating modes to drive either:                                    Thunderbolt 3 peripherals.
• Native USB 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1
                                                                           Intel® JHL6540 Thunderbolt™3 Controller
• Native DisplayPort* 1.1 and 1.2a2
• Thunderbolt at 20 and 40 Gbps
In the Thunderbolt mode, a Thunderbolt 3 port has the ability                                                  Port                DP

to support one or two (4 lane) DisplayPort interface(s), and up to                                                                        4 x HBR2 Lanes
4 lanes of PCI Express* Gen 3. If the Thunderbolt device has two
Thunderbolt ports, the dynamic mode configuration described above                                                  Intel® JHL6540
                                                                                                           Thunderbolt™ 3 Controller
will be configured on the downstream or second port of the device
when another cable and device are plugged into it. Each mode will
                                                                                                               Port
still be supported on this downstream connector, and data and display                                            B
                                                                                                                                  PCIe
                                                                                  Can also provide DP x4                                  4 x PCIe Gen 3
traffic will be provided as needed to that downstream port. If each               HBR2 or USB 3.1 Gen 2
consecutive device is a Thunderbolt device, up to six devices in
a chain can be supported.
