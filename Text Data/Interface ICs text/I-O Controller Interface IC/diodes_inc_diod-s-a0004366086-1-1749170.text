1        INTRODUCTION
         PI7C9X113SL is a PCIe-to-PCI/PCI-X bridge. PI7C9X113SL is compliant with the PCI Express Base
         Specification, Revision 1.1, the PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification, Revision 1.1, the PCI Local
         Bus Specification, Revision 3.0 and PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X Bridge Specification, Revision 1.0. PI7C9X113SL
         supports transparent mode operation and forward bridging. PI7C9X113SL has an x1 PCI Express upstream port
         and a 32-bit PCI downstream port. The 32-bit PCI downstream port is 66MHz capable (see Figure 1-1).
         PI7C9X113SL configuration registers are backward compatible with existing PCI bridge software and firmware.
         No modification of PCI bridge software and firmware is needed for the original operation.

         AD [31:0]         125, 126, 124, 121,        B   Address / Data: Multiplexed address and data bus. Address phase is aligned with
                           122, 120, 119, 117,            first clock of FRAME_L assertion. Data phase is aligned with IRDY_L or TRDY_L
                           113, 111, 110, 109,            assertion. Data is transferred on rising edges of CLKOUT[0] when both IRDY_L and

                           90, 88, 86, 85, 83, 80,        asserted), PI7C9X113SL drives AD to a valid logic level when arbiter is parking to
                           79, 78, 75, 74, 71, 70,        PI7C9X113SL on PCI bus.

         CBE_L[3:0]        116, 99, 89, 76            B   Command / Byte Enables (Active LOW): Multiplexed command at address phase
                                                          and byte enable at data phase. During address phase, the initiator drives commands on
                                                          CBE [3:0] signals to start the transaction. If the command is a write transaction, the
                                                          initiator will drive the byte enables during data phase. Otherwise, the target will drive
                                                          the byte enables during data phase. During bus idle, PI7C9X113SL drives CBE [3:0]
                                                          signals to a valid logic level when arbiter is parking to PI7C9X113SL on PCI bus.
         PAR               94                         B   Parity Bit: Parity bit is an even parity (i.e. even number of 1’s), which generates
                                                          based on the values of AD [31:0], CBE [3:0]. If PI7C9X113SL is an initiator with a
                                                          write transaction, PI7C9X113SL will tri-state PAR. If PI7C9X113SL is a target and
                                                          a write transaction, PI7C9X113SL will drive PAR one clock after the address or data
                                                          phase. If PI7C9X113SL is a target and a read transaction, PI7C9X113SL will drive
                                                          PAR one clock after the address phase and tri-state PAR during data phases. PAR is
                                                          tri-stated one cycle after the AD lines are tri-stated. During bus idle, PI7C9X113SL
                                                          drives PAR to a valid logic level when arbiter is parking to PI7C9X113SL on PCI
                                                          bus.
         FRAME_L           63                         B   FRAME (Active LOW): Driven by the initiator of a transaction to indicate the
                                                          beginning and duration an access. The de-assertion of FRAME_L indicates the final
                                                          data phase signaled by the initiator in burst transfers. Before being tri-stated, it is
                                                          driven to a de-asserted state for one cycle.
         IRDY_L            97                         B   IRDY (Active LOW): Driven by the initiator of a transaction to indicate its ability to

                                                          not de-asserted until the end of the data phase. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-
                                                          asserted state for one cycle.

         NAME             PIN ASSIGNMENT TYPE DESCRIPTION
         TRDY_L           100              B  TRDY (Active LOW): Driven by the target of a transaction to indicate its ability to
                                              complete current data phase on the primary side. Once asserted in a data phase, it is
                                              not de-asserted until the end of the data phase. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-

         DEVSEL_L         98               B  Device Select (Active LOW): Asserted by the target indicating that the device is
                                              accepting the transaction. As a master, PI7C9X113SL waits for the assertion of this

                                              abort. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-asserted state for one cycle.
         STOP_L           96               B  STOP (Active LOW): Asserted by the target indicating that the target is requesting
                                              the initiator to stop the current transaction. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-
                                              asserted state for one cycle.
         LOCK_L           93               B  LOCK (Active LOW): Asserted by the initiator for multiple transactions to
                                              complete. PI7C9X113SL does not support any upstream LOCK transaction.
         PERR_L           92               B  Parity Error (Active LOW): Asserted when a data parity error is detected for data
                                              received on the PCI bus interface. Before being tri-stated, it is driven to a de-asserted
                                              state for one cycle.
         SERR_L           61              IOD System Error (Active LOW): Can be driven LOW by any device to indicate a
                                              system error condition. If SERR control is enabled, PI7C9X113SL will drive this pin
                                              on:
                                                   Address parity error

                                              This signal is an open drain buffer that requires an external pull-up resistor for proper
                                              operation.
         REQ_L [3:0]      33, 34, 32, 31    I Request (Active LOW): REQ_L’s are asserted by bus master devices to request for
                                              transactions on the PCI bus. The master devices de-assert REQ_Ls for at least 2 PCI
                                              clock cycles before asserting them again. If external arbiter is selected, REQ_L [0]
                                              will be the bus grant input to PI7C9X113SL. Also, REQ_L [3:1] will become the

         GNT_L [3:0]      41, 39, 40, 37   O  Grant (Active LOW): PI7C9X113SL asserts GNT_Ls to release PCI bus control to
                                              bus master devices. During idle and all GNT_Ls are de-asserted and arbiter is parking
                                              to PI7C9X113SL, PI7C9X113SL will drive AD, CBE, and PAR to valid logic levels.
                                              If external arbiter is selected, GNT_L [0] will be the bus request from PI7C9X113SL
                                              to external arbiter. Also, GNT_L [3:1] will become the GPO [2:0].

3        MODE SELECTION AND PIN STRAPPING
3.1      FUNCTIONAL MODE SELECTION
         PI7C9X113SL uses TM1 and TM0 pins to select different modes of operations. These input signals are required
         to be stable during normal operation. One of the four combinations of normal operation can be selected by setting
         the logic values for the three mode select pins. For example, if the logic values are low for both two (TM1 and
         TM0) pins, the normal operation will have EEPROM (I2C) support with internal arbiter. The designated operation
         with respect to the values of the TM1 and TM0 pins are defined on Table 3-1:
       Table 3-1 Mode Selection
          TM1 Strapped     TM0 Strapped             Functional Mode
                0                0          EEPROM (I2C) support
                0                1          SM Bus support
3.2      PIN STRAPPING
         If TM1 is strapped to low, PI7C9X113SL uses REQ_L[3:2] as the strapping pins at the PCIe PERST_L
         de-assertion to enable Clock Power Management feature.

4        TRANSPARENT AND FORWARD BRIDGING
4.1      TRANSPARENT MODE
       In transparent bridge mode, base class code of PI7C9X113SL is set to be 06h (bridge device). The sub-class code is
       set to be 04h (PCI-to-PCI bridge). Programming interface is set to either 00h or 01h. If this interface is set to 00h,
       subtractive decoding is not supported. If it is set to 01h, legacy support is enabled and subtractive decoding is
       supported.
       When Subtractive Decoding PCI-to-PCI bridge is enabled by setting the legacy bit (bit 0 of offset 98h), all cycles
       (Memory/IO) are forwarded to downstream PCI devices. However, the Type-1 configuration cycle still should be
       checked for the bus number in order to be forwarded to PCI bus. The PCI-X/PCIe capability is not included in the
       Capability List and all PCI-X/PCIe capability registers and Extended Configuration registers are treated as reserved
       registers. As a result, all Write accesses are completed normally but data is discarded, and all Read accesses are
       returned with data value of 0.
       When PCI bus Subtractive Decoding Enable bit (bit 1 of 98h) is set, the device performs subtractive decode at PCI
       bus when the cycle is outside the range (negative decoding is used).
       PI7C9X113SL has type-1 configuration header. These configuration registers are the same as traditional transparent
       PCI-to-PCI Bridge. In fact, it is backward compatible to the software that supporting traditional transparent
       PCI-to-PCI bridges. Configuration registers can be accessed from several different ways. For PCI Express access,
       PCI Express configuration transaction is in forward bridge mode. For I2C access, I2C bus protocol is used with
       EEPROM selected (TM0=0). For SM bus access, SM bus protocol is used with SM bus selected (TM0=1).
4.2      FORWARD BRDIGE
       PI7C9X113SL supports forward mode of bridging. In forward bridging mode, its PCI Express interface is
       connected to a root complex and its PCI bus interface is connected to PCI devices.
       PCI based systems and peripherals are ubiquitous in the I/O interconnect technology market today. It will be a
       tremendous effort to convert existing PCI based products to be used in PCI Express systems. PI7C9X113SL
       provides a solution to bridge existing PCI based products to the latest PCI Express technology.

5        PCI EXPRESS FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
5.1      TLP STRUCTURE
       PCI Express TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) Structure is comprised of format, type, traffic class, attributes, TLP
       digest, TLP poison, and length of data payload.
       There are four TLP formats defined in PI7C9X113SL based on the states of FMT [1] and FMT [0] as shown on
       Table 5-1 .
       Table 5-1 TLP Format
               FMT [1]              FMT [0]         TLP Format
                  0                    0            3 double word, without data
                  0                    1            4 double word, without data
                  1                    0            3 double word, with data
                  1                    1            4 double word, with data
       Data payload of PI7C9X113SL can range from 4 (1DW) to 512 (128DW) bytes. PI7C9X113SL supports three TLP
       routing mechanisms. They are comprised of Address, ID, and Implicit routings. Address routing is being used for
       Memory and IO requests. ID based (bus, device, function numbers) routing is being used for configuration requests.
       Implicit routing is being used for message routing. There are two message groups (baseline and advanced
       switching). The baseline message group contains INTx interrupt signaling, power management, error signaling,
       locked transaction support, slot power limit support, vendor defined messages, hot-plug signaling. The other is
       advanced switching support message group. The advanced switching support message contains data packet and
       signal packet messages. Advanced switching is beyond the scope of PI7C9X113SL implementation.
       The r [2:0] values of the "type" field will determine the destination of the message to be routed. All baseline
       messages must use the default traffic class zero (TC0).
5.2      VIRTUAL ISOCHRONOUS OPERATION
       This section provides a summary of Virtual Isochronous Operation supported by PI7C9X113SL. Virtual
       Isochronous support is disabled by default. Virtual Isochronous feature can be turned on with setting bit [26] of
       offset 40h to one. Control bits are designated for selecting which traffic class (TC1-7) to be used for upstream (PCI
       -to-PCI Express). PI7C9X113SL accepts only TC0 packets of configuration, IO, and message packets for
       downstream (PCI Express-to-PCI). If configuration, IO and message packets have traffic class other than TC0,
       PI7C9X113SL will treat them as malformed packets. PI7C9X113SL maps all downstream memory packets from
       PCI Express to PCI transactions regardless the virtual Isochronous operation is enabled or not.

6.2      PCI EXPRESS EXTENDED CAPABILITY REGISTER MAP
       PI7C9X113SL also supports PCI Express Extended Capabilities with from 257-byte to 4096-byte space. The offset
       range is from 100h to FFFh. The offset 100h is defined for Advance Error Reporting (ID=0001h). The offset 150h
       is defined for Virtual Channel (ID=0002h).
       When Subtractive Decoding PCI-to-PCI bridge is enabled, the PCI-X/PCIe capability is not included in the
       Capability List and all PCI-X/PCIe capability registers and Extended Configuration registers are treated as reserved
       registers.

7         GPIO PINS AND SM BUS ADDRESS
       GPIO[3:0] are defined for SMBUS device ID if TM0=1.
       GPIO[3:0] can be further defined to serve other functions in the further generations.
       With 128QFP package, additional three GPI and three GPO pins can be used when external arbiter is selected, and
       REQ_L[3:1] and GNT_L[3:1] will be mapped to GPI[2:0] and GPO[2:0] respectively.
       The address-strapping table of SMBUS with GPIO [3:0] pins is defined in the following table:

8        CLOCK SCHEME
       PCI Express Interface:
       PI7C9X113SL requires 100MHz differential clock inputs through the pins of REFCLKP and REFCLKN.
       PCI Interface:
       PI7C9X113SL generates four clock outputs, from either external clock input (1MHz to 66MHz) at CLKIN or
       internal clock generator:
       PI7C9X113SL can use configuration control to enable or disable the secondary clock output: CLKOUT[3:0].
       PI7C9X113SL used either internally feedbacked clock from CLKOUT[0] or external clock input applied at
       CLKOUT[0], for internal secondary interface logic.
       For using internal clock source, the internal clock generator needs to be enabled with CLKIN driven high or low.
       CLKIN and M66EN signals become the selection for PCI Frequency at 50MHz/25MHz or 66MHz/33MHz.
       Table 8-1 Frequency of PCI CLKOUT with Internal Clock Source:
         CLKIN              M66EN        PCI Clock
         0                  0            33MHz
         0                  1            66MHz
         1                  0            25MHz
         1                  1            50MHz
       The PI7C9X113SL PCI Clock Outputs, CLKOUT [3:0], can be enabled or disabled through the configuration
       register.
       PI7C9X113SL supports three different implementations of PCI clock.
             Internal clock generator, and internal clock buffering.
                      o Internal feedback
                      o External feedback
             External clock source, and internal clock buffering.

       In this configuration, user simply connects the external clock source to CLKIN pin. And user needs to make sure
       the clock is preset (toggling) before the fundamental reset de-asserted (e.g. PERST_L). In this mode, the frequency
       is the same as the input clock source.

9        INTERRUPTS
       PI7C9X113SL supports interrupt message packets on PCIe side. PI7C9X113SL supports PCI interrupt (INTA, B, C,
       D) pins or MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) on PCI side. PCI interrupts and MSI are mutually exclusive. In order
       words, if MSI is enabled, PCI interrupts will be disabled. PI7C9X113SL support 64-bit addressing MSI.
       PI7C9X113SL maps the PCI interrupts pins or MSI if enable on PCI side to interrupt message packets on PCIe side.
       There are eight interrupt message packets. They are Assert_INTA, Assert_INTB, Assert_INTC, Assert_INTD,
       Deassert_INTA, Deassert_INTB, Deassert_INTC, and Deassert_INTD. PI7C9X113SL tracks the PCI interrupt
       (INTA, INTB, INTC, and INTD) pins and maps them to the eight interrupt messages. See
       Table 9-1 for interrupt mapping information.

10       EEPROM (I2C) INTERFACE AND SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BUS
10.1 EEPROM (I2C) INTERFACE
       PI7C9X113SL supports EEPROM interface through I2C bus. In EEPROM interface, pin 4 is the EEPROM clock
       (SCL) and pin 6 is the EEPROM data (SDL). TM1 and TM0 are strapped accordingly to select EEPROM interface
       or System Management Bus. EEPROM (I2C) interface is enabled with TM1=0 and TM0=0. When EEPROM
       interface is selected, SCL is an output. SCL is the I2C bus clock to the I2C device. In addition, SDL is a
       bi-directional signal for sending and receiving data.
10.2 SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BUS
       PI7C9X113SL supports SM bus protocol if TM1=0 and TM0=1. In addition, SMBCLK (pin 4) and SMBDAT (pin
       6) are utilized as the clock and data pins respectively for the SM bus.
       When SM bus interface is selected, SMBCLK pin is an input for the clock of SM bus and SMBDAT pin is an open
       drain buffer that requires external pull-up resistor for proper operation.

11       RESET SCHEME
       PI7C9X113SL requires the fundamental reset (PERST_L) input for internal logic. Also, PI7C9X113SL has a
       power-on-reset (POR) circuit to detect VDDCAUX power supply for auxiliary logic control.
             Cold Reset:
       A cold reset is a fundamental or power-on reset that occurs right after the power is applied to PI7C9X113SL (during
       initial power up). See section 7.1.1 of PCI Express to PCI Bridge Specification, Revision 1.0 for details.
             Warm Reset:
       A warm reset is a reset that triggered by the hardware without removing and re-applying the power sources to
       PI7C9X113SL.
             Hot Reset:
       A hot reset is a reset that used an in-band mechanism for propagating reset across a PCIe link to PI7C9X113SL.
       PI7C9X113SL will enter to training control reset when it receives two consecutive TS1 or TS2 order-sets with reset
       bit set.
             DL_DOWN Reset:
       If the PCIe link goes down, the Transaction and Data Link Layer will enter DL_DOWN status. PI7C9X113SL
       discards all transactions and returns all logic and registers to initial state except the sticky registers.
       Upon receiving reset (cold, warm, hot, or DL_DOWN) on PCIe interface, PI7C9X113SL will generate PCI reset
       (RESET_L) to the downstream devices on the PCI bus in forward bridge mode. The PCI reset de-assertion follows
       the de-assertion of the reset received from PCIe interface. The reset bit of Bridge Control Register may be set
       depending on the application. PI7C9X113SL will tolerant to receive and process SKIP order-sets at an average
       interval between 1180 to 1538 Symbol Times. PI7C9X113SL does not keep PCI reset active when VD33 power is
       off even though VAUX (3.3v) is supported. It is recommended to add a weak pull-down resistor on its application
       board to ensure PCI reset is low when VD33 power is off (see section 7.3.2 of PCI Bus Power management
       Specification Revision 1.1).
       PI7C9X113SL transmits one Electrical Idle order-set and enters to Electrical Idle.

12       IEEE 1149.1 COMPATIBLE JTAG CONTROLLER
       An IEEE 1149.1 compatible Test Access Port (TAP) controller and associated TAP pins are provided to support
       boundary scan in PI7C9X113SL for board-level continuity test and diagnostics. The supported TAP pins are TCK,
       TDI, TDO and TMS. All digital input, output, input/output pins are tested except TAP pins.
       The IEEE 1149.1 Test Logic consists of a TAP controller, an instruction register, and a group of test data registers
       including Bypass and Boundary Scan registers. The TAP controller is a synchronous 16-state machine driven by the
       Test Clock (TCK) and the Test Mode Select (TMS) pins. An independent power on reset circuit is provided to
       ensure the machine is in TEST_LOGIC_RESET state at power-up. The JTAG signal lines are not active when the
       PCI resource is operating PCI bus cycles.
12.1 INSTRUCTION REGISTER
       PI7C9X113SL implements a 5-bit Instruction register to control the operation of the JTAG logic. The defined
       instruction codes are shown in Table 14-1. Those bit combinations that are not listed are equivalent to the BYPASS
       (11111) instruction:

12.2 BYPASS REGISTER
       The required bypass register (one-bit shift register) provides the shortest path between TDI and TDO when a bypass
       instruction is in effect. This allows rapid movement of test data to and from other components on the board. This
       path can be selected when no test operation is being performed on the PI7C9X113SL.

12.4 BOUNDARY SCAN REGISTER
       The boundary scan register has a set of serial shift-register cells. A chain of boundary scan cells is formed by
       connected the internal signal of the PI7C9X113SL package pins. The VDD, VSS, and JTAG pins are not in the
       boundary scan chain. The input to the shift register is TDI and the output from the shift register is TDO. There are 4
       different types of boundary scan cells, based on the function of each signal pin.
       The boundary scan register cells are dedicated logic and do not have any system function. Data may be loaded into
       the boundary scan register master cells from the device input pins and output pin-drivers in parallel by the
       mandatory SAMPLE and EXTEST instructions. Parallel loading takes place on the rising edge of TCK.

13       POWER MANAGEMENT
       PI7C9X113SL supports D0, D3-hot, D3-cold Power States. D1 and D2 states are not supported. The PCI Express
       Physical Link Layer of the PI7C9X113SL device supports the PCI Express Link Power Management with L0, L0s,
       L1, L2/L3 ready and L3 Power States. For the PCI Port of PI7C9X113SL, it supports the standard PCI Power
       Management States with B0, B1, B2 and B3.
       During D3-hot state, the main power supplies of VDDP, VDDC, and VD33 can be turned off to save power while
       keeping the VDDAUX, VDDCAUX, and VAUX with the auxiliary power supplies to maintain all necessary
       information to be restored to the full power D0 state. PI7C9X113SL has been designed to have sticky registers that
       are powered by auxiliary power supplies. PME_L pin allows PCI devices to request power management state
       changes. Along with the operating system and application software, PCI devices can achieve optimum power
       saving by using PME_L. PI7C9X113SL converts PME_L signal information to power management messages to
       the upstream switches or root complex.
       PI7C9X113SL also supports ASPM (Active State Power Management) to facilitate the link power saving.
       PI7C9X113SL supports WAKE_L signal but does not support beacon generation during power management.

14        POWER SEQUENCING
       The PI7C9X113SL requires two voltages: 3.3V I/O voltage and 1.1V core voltage. The 1.0V VDDCAUX is
       consider the same as core voltage, and can be combined as one. When designing the power supplies for
       PI7C9X113SL, the user can either apply ALL voltages at the same time, or turn on the higher voltage (3.3V) first,
       followed by the lower voltages (1.1V) within suggested limits. If all power rails are not applied at the same time, the
       PI7C9X113SL will not be damaged as long as 3.3V is applied either before or at the same time as 1.1V.
       During power cycle, if there is a delay in applying 1.1V core voltage after the 3.3V is applied, the internal logic
       might be placed in an unknown state if the power off period is not long enough to cause PI7C9X113SL totally
       discharged. This condition in turn may produce undetermined I/O states on some pins. If the core logic is totally
       discharged before applying 3.3V, then all bi-directional I/O pins will stay at their default states.
       The typical time for PI7C9X113SL to discharge completely is less than 3 seconds, but in extreme cases this period
       can be as long as 50 seconds. Certain precautions should be made if the delay between 3.3V and 1.1V is larger than
       50ms. Figure 14-1 below shows the I/O timing sequence with undetermined I/O state, and Figure 14-2 shows the
       recommended power sequence timing.

14.1 INITIAL POWER-UP (G3 TO L0)
       As long as PERST# is active, all PCI Express functions are held in reset. The main supplies ramp up to their
       specified levels (3.3 V and 12 V). Sometime during this stabilization time, the REFCLK starts and stabilizes. After
       there has been time (TPVPERL) for the power and clock to become stable, PERST# is deasserted high and the PCI
       Express functions can start up.

       Note:
       1. Any supplied power is stable when it meets the requirements specified for that power supply.
       2. A supplied reference clock is stable when it meets the requirements specified for the reference clock. The PEREST# signal is asserted and
            de-asserted asynchronously with respect to the supplied reference clock.
       3. The PEREST# signal must be asserted within TFAIL of any supplied power going out specification.
       4. Measured from WAKE# assertion/de-assertion to valid input level at the system PM controller. Since WAKE# is an open-drain signal, the
            rise time is dependent on the total capacitance on the platform and the system board pull-up resistor. It is the responsibility of the system
            designer to meet the rise time specification.

       In order to support auxiliary power management fully, it is recommended to have VD33/VDDC and
       VAUX/VDDCAUX separated. However, if auxiliary power management is not required, VD33 and VDDC can be
       connected to VAUX and VDDCAUX respectively.
       The typical power consumption of PI7C9X113SL is less than 350 mW.
       PI7C9X113SL is capable of sustaining 1500V human body model for the ESD protection without any damages.
