Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.
•     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
      knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
      Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
      mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be

OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. Microchip disclaims all liability arising from this information and its use. Use of Micro-
chip devices in life support and/or safety applications is entirely at the buyer’s risk, and the buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
