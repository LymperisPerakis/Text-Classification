                 SC18IS602B
                 I2C-bus to SPI bridge
                 Rev. 7 — 21 October 2019                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The SC18IS602B is designed to serve as an interface between a standard I2C-bus of a
              microcontroller and an SPI bus. This allows the microcontroller to communicate directly
              with SPI devices through its I2C-bus. The SC18IS602B operates as an I2C-bus
              slave-transmitter or slave-receiver and an SPI master. The SC18IS602B controls all the
              SPI bus-specific sequences, protocol, and timing. The SC18IS602B has its own internal
              oscillator, and it supports four SPI chip select outputs that may be configured as GPIO
              when not used.
2. Features and benefits

7. Functional description
                       The SC18IS602B acts as a bridge between an I2C-bus and an SPI interface. It allows an
                       I2C-bus master device to communicate with any SPI-enabled device.
                   7.1 I2C-bus interface
                       The I2C-bus uses two wires (SDA and SCL) to transfer information between devices
                       connected to the bus, and it has the following features:
                         • Bidirectional data transfer between masters and slaves
                         • Multi-master bus (no central master)
                         • Arbitration between simultaneously transmitting masters without corruption of serial
                            data on the bus
                         • Serial clock synchronization allows devices with different bit rates to communicate via
                            one serial bus
                         • Serial clock synchronization can be used as a handshake mechanism to suspend and
                            resume serial transfer
                         • The I2C-bus may be used for test and diagnostic purposes
                       A typical I2C-bus configuration is shown in Figure 3. (Refer to NXP Semiconductors

                       The SC18IS602B device provides a byte-oriented I2C-bus interface that supports data
                       transfers up to 400 kHz. When the I2C-bus master is reading data from SC18IS602B, the
                       device will be a slave-transmitter. The SC18IS602B will be a slave-receiver when the
                       I2C-bus master is sending data. At no time does the SC18IS602B act as an I2C-bus
                       master, however, it does have the ability to hold the SCL line LOW between bytes to
                       complete its internal processes.

                                                                                                                   002aac446
                        Fig 4.   Slave address
                      The first seven bits of the first byte sent after a START condition defines the slave address
                      of the device being accessed on the bus. The eighth bit determines the direction of the
                      message. A ‘0’ in the least significant position of the first byte means that the master will
                      write information to a selected slave. A ‘1’ in this position means that the master will read
                      information from the slave. When an address is sent, each device in a system compares
                      the first seven bits after the START condition with its address. If they match, the device
                      considers itself addressed by the master as a slave-receiver or slave-transmitter,
                      depending on the R/W bit.
                      A slave address of the SC18IS602B is comprised of a fixed and a programmable part.
                      The programmable part of the slave address enables the maximum possible number of
                      such devices to be connected to the I2C-bus. Since the SC18IS602B has three
                      programmable address bits (defined by the A2, A1, and A0 pins), it is possible to have
                      eight of these devices on the same bus.
                      The state of the A2, A1, and A0 pins are latched at reset. Changes made after reset will
                      not alter the address.
                      When SC18IS602B is busy after the address byte is transmitted, it will not acknowledge
                      its address.
                7.1.2 Write to data buffer
                      All communications to or from the SC18IS602B occur through the data buffer. The data
                      buffer is 200 bytes deep. A message begins with the SC18IS602B address, followed by
                      the Function ID. Depending upon the Function ID, zero to 200 data bytes can follow.
                      The SC18IS602B will place the data received into a buffer and continue loading the buffer
                      until a STOP condition is received. After the STOP condition is detected, further
                      communications will not be acknowledged until the function designated by the Function ID
                      has been completed.

                      Data in the buffer will be sent to the SPI port if the Function ID is 01h to 0Fh. The Function
                      ID contains the Slave Select (SS) to be used for the transmission on the SPI port. There
                      are four Slave Selects that can be used, with each SS being selected by one of the bits in

                      can be enabled for an SPI message. If more than one SSn pin is enabled at one time, the
                      user should be aware of possible contention on the data outputs of the SPI slave devices.

                      The data on the SPI port will contain the same information as the I2C-bus data, but without
                      the slave address and Function ID. For example, if the message shown in Figure 6 is
                      transmitted on the I2C-bus, the SPI bus will send the message shown in Figure 7.

                        Fig 7.       SPI message
                      The SC18IS602B counts the number of data bytes sent to the I2C-bus port and will
                      automatically send this same number of bytes to the SPI bus. As the data is transmitted
                      from the MOSI pin, it is also read from the MISO pin and saved in the data buffer.
                      Therefore, the old data in the buffer is overwritten. The data in the buffer can then be read
                      back.
                      If the data from the SPI bus needs to be returned to the I2C-bus master, the process must
                      be completed by reading the data buffer. Section 8 gives an example of an SPI read.
                7.1.4 Read from buffer
                      A read from the data buffer requires no Function ID. The slave address with the R/W bit
                      set to a ‘1’ will cause the SC18IS602B to send the buffer contents to the I2C-bus master.
                      The buffer contents are not modified during the read process.

                7.1.5 Configure SPI Interface - Function ID F0h
                      The SPI hardware operating mode, data direction, and frequency can be changed by
                      sending a ‘Configure SPI Interface’ command to the I2C-bus.

                      After the SC18IS602B address is transmitted on the bus, the Configure SPI Interface
                      Function ID (F0h) is sent followed by a byte which will define the SPI communications.
                      The Clock Phase bit (CPHA) allows the user to set the edges for sampling and changing
                      data. The Clock Polarity bit (CPOL) allows the user to set the clock polarity. Figure 19 and
                      Figure 20 show the different settings of Clock Phase bit CPHA.

                7.1.6 Clear Interrupt - Function ID F1h
                      An interrupt is generated by the SC18IS602B after any SPI transmission has been
                      completed. This interrupt can be cleared (INT pin HIGH) by sending a ‘Clear Interrupt’
                      command. It is not necessary to clear the interrupt; when polling the device, this function
                      may be ignored.

                      A low-power mode may be entered by sending the ‘Idle Mode’ command.
                                                          S       SLAVE ADDRESS                   W     A         F2h    A   P

                        Fig 12. GPIO Write
                      The data byte following the F4h command will determine the state of SS3, SS2, SS1, and
                      SS0, if they are configured as GPIO. The Port Enable function will define if these pins are
                      used as SPI Slave Selects or if they are GPIO.

                7.1.9 GPIO Read - Function ID F5h
                      The state of the pins defined as GPIO may be read into the SC18IS602B data buffer using
                      the GPIO Read function.
                                             S      SLAVE ADDRESS                  W     A             F5h        A DATA       A    P
                                                                                                                           002aac455
                        Fig 13. GPIO Read
                      Note that this function does not return the value of the GPIO. To receive the GPIO
                      contents, a one-byte Read Buffer command would be required. The value of the Read
                      Buffer command will return the following byte.
                      Table 8.    GPIO Read (F5h) bit allocation
                            7           6                      5                      4                      3       2                1                       0
                           X           X                      X                      X                     SS3      SS2             SS1                    SS0
                      Data for pins not defined as GPIO are undefined.
                      A GPIO Read is always performed to update the GPIO data in the buffer. The buffer is
                      undefined after the GPIO data is read back from the buffer. Therefore, reading data from
                      the GPIO always requires a two-message sequence (GPIO Read, followed by Read
                      Buffer).
               7.1.10 GPIO Enable - Function ID F6h
                      At reset, the Slave Select pins (SS0, SS1, SS2 and SS3) are configured to be used as
                      slave select outputs. If these pins are not required for the SPI functions, they can be used
                      as GPIO after they are enabled as GPIO. Any combination of pins may be configured to
                      function as GPIO or Slave Selects.
                      After the GPIO Enable function is sent, the ports defined as GPIO will be configured as
                      quasi-bidirectional.
                                             S      SLAVE ADDRESS                  W     A             F6h        A DATA       A    P
                                                                                                                           002aac456
                        Fig 14. GPIO Enable
                      The data byte following the F6h command byte will determine which pins can be used as
                      GPIO. A logic 1 will enable the pin as a GPIO, while a logic 0 will disable GPIO control.

                       The pins defined as GPIO may be configured by software to one of four types on a
                       pin-by-pin basis. These are: quasi-bidirectional, push-pull, open-drain, and input-only.
                       Two bits select the output type for each port pin.

                       The SSn pins defined as GPIO, for example SS0.0 and SS0.1, may be configured by
                       software to one of four types. These are: quasi-bidirectional, push-pull, open-drain, and
                       input-only. Two configuration bits in GPIO Configuration register for each pin select the
                       type for each pin. A pin has Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression
                       circuit.
              7.1.11.1 Quasi-bidirectional output configuration
                       Quasi-bidirectional outputs can be used both as an input and output without the need to
                       reconfigure the pin. This is possible because when the pin outputs a logic HIGH, it is
                       weakly driven, allowing an external device to pull the pin LOW. When the pin is driven
                       LOW, it is driven strongly and able to sink a large current. There are three pull-up
                       transistors in the quasi-bidirectional output that serve different purposes.
                       One of these pull-ups, called the ‘very weak’ pull-up, is turned on whenever the port latch
                       for the pin contains a logic 1. This very weak pull-up sources a very small current that will
                       pull the pin HIGH if it is left floating.
                       A second pull-up, called the ‘weak’ pull-up, is turned on when the port latch for the pin
                       contains a logic 1 and the pin itself is also at a logic 1 level. This pull-up provides the
                       primary source current for a quasi-bidirectional pin that is outputting a 1. If this pin is

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                SC18IS602B
                                                                                                                                         I2C-bus to SPI bridge
                       pulled LOW by an external device, the weak pull-up turns off, and only the very weak
                       pull-up remains on. In order to pull the pin LOW under these conditions, the external
                       device has to sink enough current to overpower the weak pull-up and pull the pin below its
                       input threshold voltage.
                       The third pull-up is referred to as the ‘strong’ pull-up. This pull-up is used to speed up
                       LOW-to-HIGH transitions on a quasi-bidirectional pin when the port latch changes from a
                       logic 0 to a logic 1. When this occurs, the strong pull-up turns on for two CPU clocks
                       quickly pulling the pin HIGH.
                       The quasi-bidirectional pin configuration is shown in Figure 15.
                       Although the SC18IS602B is a 3 V device, most of the pins are 5 V tolerant. If 5 V is
                       applied to a pin configured in quasi-bidirectional mode, there will be a current flowing from
                       the pin to VDD causing extra power consumption. Therefore, applying 5 V to pins
                       configured in quasi-bidirectional mode is discouraged.
                       A quasi-bidirectional pin has a Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression
                       circuit.

              7.1.11.2 Open-drain output configuration
                       The open-drain output configuration turns off all pull-ups and only drives the pull-down
                       transistor of the pin when the port latch contains a logic 0. To be used as a logic output, a
                       pin configured in this manner must have an external pull-up, typically a resistor tied to
                       VDD. The pull-down for this mode is the same as for the quasi-bidirectional mode.
                       The open-drain pin configuration is shown in Figure 16.
                       An open-drain pin has a Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression circuit.

                       The input-only pin configuration is shown in Figure 17. It is a Schmitt-triggered input that
                       also has a glitch suppression circuit.

                       The push-pull output configuration has the same pull-down structure as both the
                       open-drain and the quasi-bidirectional output modes but provides a continuous strong
                       pull-up when the port latch contains a logic 1. The push-pull mode may be used when
                       more source current is needed from a pin output.
                       The push-pull pin configuration is shown in Figure 18.
                       A push-pull pin has a Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression circuit.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                   SC18IS602B
                                                                                                                           I2C-bus to SPI bridge
                   7.2 SPI interface
                       The SPI interface can support Mode 0 through Mode 3 of the SPI specification and can
                       operate up to 1.8 Mbit/s. The SPI interface uses at least four pins: SPICLK, MOSI, MISO,
                       and Slave Select (SSn).
                       SSn are the slave select pins. In a typical configuration, an SPI master selects one SPI
                       device as the current slave.
                       There are actually four SSn pins (SS0, SS1, SS2 and SS3) to allow the SC18IS602B to
                       communicate with multiple SPI devices.
                       The SC18IS602B generates the SPICLK (SPI clock) signal in order to send and receive
                       data. The SCLK, MOSI, and MISO are typically tied together between two or more SPI
                       devices. Data flows from the SC18IS602B (master) to slave on the MOSI pin (Pin 6) and
                       the data flows from slave to SC18IS602B (master) on the MISO pin (Pin 5).
8. I2C-bus to SPI communications example
                       The following example describes a typical sequence of events required to read the
                       contents of an SPI-based EEPROM. This example assumes that the SC18IS602B is
                       configured to respond to address 50h. A START condition is shown as ‘ST’, while a STOP
                       condition is ‘SP’. The data is presented in hexadecimal format.
                        1. The first message is used to configure the SPI port for mode and frequency.
                                  ST,50,F0,02,SP                   SPI frequency 115 kHz using Mode 0
                        2. An SPI EEPROM first requires that a Write Enable command be sent before data can
                           be written.
                                  ST,50,04,06,SP                   EEPROM write enable using SS2, assuming the Write Enable is
                                                                   06h
                        3. Clear the interrupt. This is not required if using a polling method rather than interrupts.
                                  ST,50,F1,SP                      Clear interrupt
                        4. Write the 8 data bytes. The first byte (Function ID) tells the SC18IS602B which Slave
                           Select output to use. This example uses SS2 (shown as 04h). The first byte sent to
                           the EEPROM is normally 02h for the EEPROM write command. The next one or two
                           bytes represent the subaddress in the EEPROM. In this example, a two-byte
                           subaddress is used. Bytes 00 and 30 would cause the EEPROM to write to
                           subaddress 0030h. The next eight bytes are the eight data bytes that will be written to
                           subaddresses 0030h through 0037h.
                                  ST,50,04,02,00,30,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,SP                                     Write 8 bytes using SS2
                        5. When an interrupt occurs, do a Clear Interrupt or wait until the SC18IS602B responds
                           to its I2C-bus address.
                                  ST,50,F1,SP                      Clear interrupt

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                      SC18IS602B
                                                                                                                                              I2C-bus to SPI bridge
                                6. Read the 8 bytes from the EEPROM. Note that we are writing a command, even
                                     though we are going to perform a read from the SPI port. The Function ID is again
                                     04h, indicating that we are going to use SS2. The EEPROM requires that you send a
                                     03h for a read, followed by the subaddress you would like to read. We are going to
                                     read back the same data previously written, so this means that the subaddress should
                                     be 0030h. We would like to read back 8 bytes so we can send eight bytes of FFh to
                                     tell the SC18IS602B to send eight more bytes on MOSI. While it is sending these
                                     eight data bytes, it is also reading the MISO pin and saving the data in the buffer.
                                            ST,50,04,03,00,30,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,SP                                              Read 8 bytes using SS2
                                7. The interrupt can be cleared, if needed.
                                            ST,50,F1,SP                         Clear interrupt
                                8. Read back the data buffer. Note that we will actually need to read back 11 data bytes
                                     since the first three bytes sent on the SPI port were the read code (03h) and the two
                                     subaddress bytes.
                                            ST,50,00,00,00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,SP                                                 Read the data buffer
                                     You can see that on the                    I2C-bus         the first four bytes do not contain the data from the
                                     SPI bus. The first byte is the SC18IS602B address, followed by three dummy data
                                     bytes. These dummy data bytes correspond to the three bytes sent to the EEPROM
                                     before it actually places data on the bus (command 03h, subaddress 0030h).

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 22) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 15 and 16
