L9637                                                                        Functional description
3     Functional description
      The L9637 is a monolithic bus driver designed to provide bidirectional serial communication
      in automotive diagnostic applications according to the specification "Diagnostic Systems
      ISO9141".
      The device provides a bidirectional link, called K, to the VBat related diagnosis bus. It also
      includes a separate comparator L which is also able to be linked to the VBat bus. The input
      TX and output RX of K are related to VCC with her integrated pull up resistances. Also the L
      comparator output LO has a pull up resistance connected to VCC.
      The maximum external pull up resistance at K related to VS should not be higher than RKO 
      5 kto achieve clear output ON conditions.
      All VBat bus defined inputs LI and K have supply voltage dependent thresholds together with
      sufficient hysteresis to suppress line spikes. These pins are protected against overvoltages,
      shorts to GND and VS and can also be driven beyond VS and GND.
      These features are also given for TX, RX and LI only taking into account the behavior of the
      internal pull up resistances. The thermal shut down function switches OFF the K output if
      the chip temperature increases above the thermal shut down threshold. To reactivate K
      again the temperature must decrease below the K switch ON temp. To achieve no fault for
      VS undervoltage conditions the outputs will be switched OFF and stay at high impedance.
      The device is also protected against reverse battery condition. During lack of VS or GND all
      pins shows high impedance characteristic. To realize a lack of the VS related bus line LI and
      K the outputs LO and RX shows defined ON status.
      Suppressing all 4 classes of "Schaffner" signals all pins can be load with short energy
      pulses of max. ±0.2 mJ. All these features together with a high possible baud rate
      >50Kbaud, controlled output slopes for low EMI, a wide power supply voltage range and a
      very small quiescent current during OFF (TX LI K=High) condition ISoff typ  120 µA, and a
      real standby function with zero power consumption ISSB typ  1 µA during system de
      powering VCC  0.5 V make this device high efficient for automotive bus system.
      After wake up of the system from OFF or SB condition the first output signal will have an
      additional delay time tdtyp  5 µs see also Figure 5.
      The typical output voltage behavior for the K, LO, RX outputs as a function of the output
      current is shown in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows a waveform of the output signal when the low
      level changes from RON * IOUT to IOUT * 2 * RON + UBE state. This variation occurs due to too
      low output current or after a negative transient forced to the output or to the supply voltage
      line.
