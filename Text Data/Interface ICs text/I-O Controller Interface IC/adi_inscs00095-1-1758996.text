The IA82510 is a "plug-and-play" drop-in replacement for the original IC. Innovasic produces
replacement ICs using its MILES™, or Managed IC Lifetime Extension System, cloning
technology. This technology produces replacement ICs far more complex than "emulation" while
ensuring they are compatible with the original IC. MILES™ captures the design of a clone so it
can be produced even as silicon technology advances. MILES™ also verifies the clone against
the original IC so that even the "undocumented features" are duplicated. This data sheet
documents all necessary engineering information about the IA82510 including functional and I/O
descriptions, electrical characteristics, and applicable timing.

2.      Description
The IA82510 is an asynchronous serial controller that provides a CPU interface to one transmit
and one receive channel. It is Form, Fit, and Function compatible with the Intel 82510.
Configuration registers are used to control the serial channel, interrupts, and modes of operation.
The CPU controls this device via address and data lines with read/write control. The CPU also
uses this interface to read and write data to receive and transmit data through the serial channel.
FIFOs and various serial modes can be used to help off-load the CPU from transmitting and
receiving data. An interrupt line provides an indication to the CPU that the device requires
servicing. The device can be configured for 8250A/16450 compatibility. See Figure 2,
Functional Block Diagram.

3.      Functional Overview
3.1     Transmitter
The Transmit function consists of a 4 11 bit FIFO, and a Transmit Engine. The 4 11 FIFO is
configurable as any depth between one and four words inclusive. The transmit engine is
responsible for reading the data out of the FIFO and placing it in the proper order on the TXD pin.
The transmit engine is highly configurable to be compatible with numerous formats, including
16450 and 8250 modes of communication. Transmit Communication parameters that can be
programmed include:
        Parity modes
        Stop Bits
        Character Length
        FIFO Depth
        Clocking Options
        RTS and CTS modes
For more details, see Section 3.4, Register Description.
3.2     Receiver
The Receiver function consists of a 4 11 configurable FIFO and a Receive Engine. The receive
engine is responsible for sampling the data on the RXD input pin, formatting the data, and placing
the data in the FIFO. The receive engine is highly configurable with parameters that include:
        Parity modes
        Stop Bits
        Character Length
        FIFO Depth
        Clocking Options
        Address Matching Options

7.2     Detail
Errata No. 1
Problem: Scrambled data during boot code shuts down UART, however device works for
application code.
Description: The RX FIFO is locked, configuration of all registers is done, then the RX FIFO is
unlocked just before entering loopback mode in both boot and application code before normal
operations begin. Boot code additionally does a blind block read of all registers before normal
operations including two reads from the unwritten RX Data FIFO. RX unlock command is
inadvertently incrementing the write pointer. For boot code, the two reads of RX data cause the
read/write pointers to be permanently out of sync. For application code, the pointers end up
synched to the same location, only because the code waits for four characters before reading. This
ends up causing an RX overrun, but to our favor because the pointers are now synched.
Workaround: Execute a “Flush RX FIFO” command (via RCM register) after configuration and
block read is complete.
Errata No. 2
Problem: Device does not operate at 8 MHz in divide-by-one mode.
Description: System testing revealed this operational deficiency.
Workaround: Switch to divide-by-two mode using 2X clock input.

Errata No. 3
Problem: Setting CLCF to x30, which effectively generates the TX clock from the incoming
SCLK signal, kills all transmits.
Description: Configuration of PMD inadvertently set so RI function is selected instead of SCLK
function. Original Intel device allows SCLK through anyway, IA82510 suppresses it.
Workaround: Set correct configuration for PMD allows TX clock generation.
Errata No. 4
Problem: Receiving streamed data has many framing errors and corrupt data when connected to
some modems.
Description: Shortened stop bit followed immediately by next start bit does not correctly detect
that start bit.
Workaround: Configure external modem to transmit two stop bits.
Errata No. 5
Problem: Transmission of streamed data does not return interrupt.
Description: Stray read of GIR sets TX FIFO interrupt hold logic, but this logic does not reset
when GER[1] is de-asserted.
Workaround: Reset logic with write to TX data or avoid stray reads of GIR.
Errata No. 6
Problem: Receiving streamed data has many framing errors at fast baud rates (divisor=6) through
bad modem lines.
Description: DPLL is not robust for RXD signal with more than 1/16 bit time of variation.
Workaround: None.

Errata No. 7
Problem: Difficulty starting oscillator with crystal.
Description: No internal feedback resistor between X1 and X2.
Workaround: Install external 1-10Mohm resistor.
Errata No. 8
Problem: Intermittent and temperature sensitive crystal oscillator operation when cycling power.
Description: Strapping state elements apparently transparent latches instead of flip flops. If flip
flop powers up to wrong state, crystal oscillator is disabled while reset is active. OK after first
reset following power-up.
Workaround: None.
Errata No. 9
Problem: Auto-acknowledge of interrupts via writing of LSR does not work.
Description: Writing LSR directly sets/resets bits 4 through 0. Also writing 0 to LSR(0) – RX
FIFO – clears the RX FIFO level as seen by FLR. Writing zero to any other LSR bits clears the
corresponding LSR/RST flag, but also corrupts the FIFO location the write pointer is set to, then
increments both the write and read pointers.
Workaround: Use other means to service interrupts, such as read of RST or RXD.
Errata No. 10
Problem: ICM Status Clear command does not clear LSR/RST overrun error.
Description: ICM Status Clear command should clear everything in RST/LSR, MSR, and TMST
except RST/LSR(0). Overrun error was missed.
Workaround: Use other means to service interrupts.

Errata No. 11
Problem: In semi-automatic/uLAN mode, the RX FIFO is only opened when an address
character matches the ACR1 or ACR0 registers (like full auto mode).
Description: In semi-auto mode, the RX FIFO should open on any address character.
Workaround: None.
Errata No. 12
Problem: Device fails to reset interrupt signal in auto acknowledge mode when character is read
from RX FIFO.
Description: RD strobe is outside the CS enable, which is outside of the Intel datasheet, but
apparently still works in the Intel device. Such a bus cycle allows the read data out, but fails to
generate the necessary internal strobe to change pointers. The same problem is found on write
accesses.
Workaround: Force bus interface to bracket RD strobe inside the CS enable.
Errata No. 13
Problem: RX FIFO locks up unexpectedly just after configuration and before starting reception.
Description: An RCM command is executed with data of xB8. This is an “enable RX”, “flush
RX machine”, “flush RX FIFO”, and “lock RX FIFO” command done in a single instruction. The
“flush RX machine” should unlock the RX FIFO, creating a conflict with the simultaneous “lock
RX FIFO” command. The original Intel device apparently ignores or gives the “lock RX FIFO”
command lower priority in this case. The IA82510 has this priority reversed. Apparently, the
application software in this case expected the “lock RX FIFO” command to fail.
Workaround: Do not execute a “flush RX FIFO” and “lock RX FIFO” command simultaneously.
Break up into separate RCM commands.

Errata No. 14
Problem: Unreliable transmits in AUTO TX mode.
Description: Many systems use the RTS output to activate the line transceiver. When the
Transmit Mode field in the TMD register is set to semi-auto or automatic mode, RTS is controlled
by the TX state machine. On the first character, RTS asserts at the same time as the start bit on
the TXD output, whereas the original Intel device asserts RTS a full bit time before assertion of
the start bit on TXD. At full temperature range, the width of the start bit can be altered to the
point of confusing the downstream receiver.
Workaround: Change firmware to Manual TX mode to control RTS vs. start of character.
