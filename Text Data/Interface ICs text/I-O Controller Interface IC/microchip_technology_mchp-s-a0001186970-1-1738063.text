1.0       INTRODUCTION
The SCH5627P is a 3.3V PC 2001 compliant Super I/O controller with an LPC interface. All legacy drivers used for
Super I/O components are supported making this interface transparent to the supporting software. The LPC bus also
supports power management, such as wake-up and sleep modes.
The SCH5627P provides temperature monitoring with auto fan control. The temperature monitor is capable of monitor-
ing up to three external diodes, one internal ambient temperature sensor or retrieving temperatures from external pro-
cessors that implement the PECI Interface. This device offers programmable automatic fan control support based on
one or more of these measured temperatures. There are four pulse width modulation (PWM) outputs with high fre-
quency support as well as four fan tachometer inputs. In addition, there is support for a bi-directional PROCHOT# pin
that may be used to generate an interrupt, adjust the programmed temperature limits in the auto fan control logic, or
force the PWM outputs on full. The RRCC feature provides a linear relationship of temperature to fan speed.
The Glue Logic includes various power management logic; including generation of RSMRST# and Power OK signal
generation. There are also two LEDs to indicate power status. The part also provides a low battery warning circuit.
The SCH5627P provides 60 General Purpose I/O control pins, which offer flexibility to the system designer.
The SCH5627P incorporates the following Super I/O components: a parallel port that is compatible with IBM PC/AT
architecture, as well as the IEEE 1284 EPP and ECP; two serial ports that are 16C550A UART compatible; a key-
board/mouse controller that uses an 8042 micro controller; and a floppy disk controller.
The SCH5627P is ACPI 1.0b/2.0 compatible and supports multiple low power-down modes. It incorporates sophisti-
cated power control circuitry (PCC), which includes keyboard and mouse wake-up events.
The SCH5627P incorporates a high-performance embedded microcontroller. The SCH5627P communicates with the
system host using the Intel® Low Pin Count bus.
The SCH5627P is directly powered by two separate suspend supply planes (VBAT and VTR) and senses a third runtime
power plane (VCC) to provide “instant on” and system power management functions. The SCH5627P also contains an
integrated VTR Reset Generator and a system power management interface that supports low-power states and can
drive state changes as a result of hardware wake events as defined by the SCH5627P wake interface.

2.2      Changes from SCH5617
The following table lists pinout changes from the SCH5617. Because GPIO names have changed for all GPIOs, GPIO
name changes have not been listed in the DIFFERENCE column. In addition, there is no distinction between Host and
8051 GPIOs; all GPIO pins can be accessed by either the EC directly or by the Host indirectly through the EMI.

3.1        Signal Descriptions
In the following table, each row with multiple entries represents a pin with multiple configuration options. The first entry
in the row is the default configuration after VTR power on. Except as noted, pins that default to GPIOs default to inputs.
All pins that default to open drain outputs are tri-stated on VTR power on.

  Note 3-1     Names in parentheses are software functions.
  Note 3-2     Output Buffers are 5V tolerant in open drain mode only.
  Note 3-3     When PWRGD_PS is 0 the buffers are tri-stated.
  Note 3-4     If a pin is used as a push pull output, it is not 5V tolerant and should not be pulled up to 5V.
  Note 3-5     External pullups must be placed on the KBDRST# and A20M pins. These pins are GPIOs that are
               inputs after an initial power-up (VTR POR). If the KBDRST# and A20M functions are to be used, the
               system must ensure that these pins are high.
  Note 3-6     HVTR must be connected to the suspend power well (VTR).
  Note 3-7     Refer to Parallel Port description for use of this pin in ECP and EPP mode.

  Note 3-8        NO GATE indicates that the pin is not protected, or affected by VCC = 0 operation. GATE indicates
                  that the pin is protected as an input, or set to a HI-Z state as an output. The GATE function applies
                  when VCC is below the trip point in the reset generator, when the pin PWRGD_PS is low (de-
                  asserted) or when the pin SLP_S3# is low (asserted).
  Note 3-9        The GATE function also applies to this pin when pin LRESET# is low (asserted).
  Note 3-10       Buffer is active when GPIO selected.
  Note 3-11       Footprints for a Pull-Up and a Pull-Down resistor should be placed near pin 104 to strap the Test_EN
                  function. A pull-up to VTR will enable the test interface on VTR POR; a 0 will disable the interface.
  Note 3-12       These function are on HVTR power supply.
  Note 3-13       When this pin is configured as a GPIO, the alternate function input is forced high.
  Note 3-14       The PWRBTN# function is always enabled, even when the pin is configured as a GPIO output. It is
                  not affected by the GPIO configuration parameters, including polarity.
  Note 3-15       The INTRUDER# function is always enabled, even when the pin is configured as a GPIO output. It
                  is not affected by the GPIO configuration parameters, including polarity.
  Note 3-16       The PECI_Ready Signal should ONLY be connected to signals that are on the VTT rail. Connect to
                  VTT, PCI Reset or PCI Clockrun.
  Note 3-17       When this pin is configured for PROCHOT_OUT# or GPIO, the pad type must be set to Open Drain.
  Note 3-18       Both the pin mux control and the pad type control (Push-Pull for PECI and Open Drain for LVSMB)
                  must be configured to switch this pin between PECI and LVSMBUS. When this pin is configured for
                  PECI and push-pull, the pad drive strength is weak, as defined for PECI; when this pin is configured
                  for Low Voltage SMBus and open-drain, the drive strength is as defined by the buffer type.
  Note 3-19       This Pin is 5V tolerant.
  Note 3-20       This Pin is forced low and glitch-protected until VTR is stable and internal power supplies have
                  stabilized.
  Note 3-21       This Pin is held in tri-state and glitch-protected until VTR is stable and internal power supplies have
                  stabilized.
  Note 3-22       Footprints for a Pull-Up and a Pull-Down resistor should be placed near pin 101 to strap the SYSOPT
                  function. A 0 will set the configuration base address to 002Eh; a pull-up to VCC will set the
                  configuration base address to 004Eh.
  Note 3-23       The JTAG signal becomes active when the TRST# pin is high.
  Note 3-24       When used as PWRBTN_OUT#, this pin requires an external pull-up to the power supply on the
                  board.
  Note 3-25       The board must have the proper pull-up on the VSB_CTL pin to allow VSB power to turn on. In this
                  case, when going into XLS5 the device will be sinking current through the resistor, so there will be a
                  DC current through the resistor in XLS5.

4.2        Register Table Conventions
4.2.1        REGISTER TYPE
A register type of “R” means that all bits within the register are read-only. All stores to these registers are ignored.
A register type of “W” means that all bits within the register are write-only. Any read from one of these registers returns 0.
A register type of “R/W” means that at least one bit in the register is read/write.
A register type of “R/WC” means that all bits in the register are either read-only or read/write-clear. A read/write-clear
bit is cleared to 0 when written with a ‘1b’. A write of a ‘0b’ to the bit has no effect. Unless otherwise noted, the bit is not
cleared on a write of ‘1b’ if hardware is simultaneously setting the bit to ‘1b’.
A register type of “R/WS” means that all bits in the register are either read-only or read/write-set. A read/write-clear bit
is set to 1 when written with a ‘1b’. A write of a ‘0b’ to the bit has no effect.
4.2.2        REGISTER FIELDS
A field labeled “Reserved” always returns 0. Writes to a reserved field are ignored.
A field labeled “MCHP Reserved” is reserved for Microchip use. Reads should be ignored and any write should be 0.
Writes of a ‘1b’ to a field labeled “MCHP Reserved” may have unpredictable results.

                                                                                             SCH5627P
5.0       POWER, CLOCKS AND RESET
5.1       Power
The SCH5627P is a 3.3V IO part. The expected external supply voltage is 3.3 Volts (nominal).
Exceptions to the 3.3V IOs are PROCHOT# pin, the two Low Voltage SMBus pins (LVSMBCLK1/LVSMBDAT1), and the
PECI pins (PECI and PECI_Ready). See Section 3.0, "Signal Descriptions".
5.1.1         EXTERNAL SUPPLY VOLTAGES
The SCH5627P is connected to three external voltage supplies: trickle supply VTR (3.3V nominal), battery supply VBAT
(3V nominal), and main supply VCC (3.3V nominal). See Section 21.0, "Electrical Specifications," on page 202 for
detailed requirements on these supply voltages.
VTR is the primary power source. It powers most of the SCH5627P’s circuitry when on. When VTR is off, the SCH5627P
switches (internally) to the secondary supply VBAT (3V nominal) to power certain logic and registers, including VBAT
RAM; the rest is powered down along with VTR. VCC is used only to sense when the system’s main power is on. Certain
legacy modules and pins are activated only when VCC is on. They are inactive otherwise.
The switch from VTR to VBAT takes place as follows:
• On rising VTR, switch from VBAT to VTR when VTR > 2.5V (nominal) or VTR > VBAT.
• On falling VTR, switch from VTR to VBAT when VTR < 2.45V (nominal) and VTR < VBAT.
Backdrive protection prevents VBAT from driving the VCC or VTR rails.
When VTR and VCC are fully powered, the potential difference between the two supplies must not exceed 500mV.
The analog circuitry used in the Hardware Monitor in the SCH5627Prequires its own copy of the VTR voltage. This sup-
ply is connected to the HVTR pin.
In addition to the three voltage supplies, the SCH5627P can also be connected to the CPU voltage, through the
PECI_VREF pin. This voltage is used to provide a reference for the PECI circuitry as well as the Low Voltage SMBus.
All four of these voltages, as well as an additional external voltage connected to the V_IN pin, can be monitored by the
Hardware Monitor.
5.1.2         INTERNAL SUPPLY VOLTAGES.
A 1.2V regulator generates the SCH5627P core power well. The input to the 1.2V Regulator is VTR. The 1.2V Reg-
ulator is not used when VTR is inactive.
The stability of the 1.2V Regulator amplifier depends on an external capacitor, VR_CAP. The capacitor requirement is
defined in Table 3-1, “Signal Descriptions,” on page 11. The choice of capacitor can be either ceramic or low ESR
tantalum. Ceramics are the recommended choice due to their superior AC performance (below 100mΩ ESR), but X5R
dielectrics should be used to prevent greater than 20% capacitance variation over temperature and voltage. Low ESR
tantalum capacitors will work but care should be taken because the ESR can vary 2x at low temperatures.
5.1.3         VTR
All EC logic, including the 64.52MHz ring oscillator, is powered by VTR and not affected by the presence or absence of
VCC. Super I/O devices are de-activated when VCC is off. The following Host-side devices remain activated and oper-
ating on VTR even when VCC is off:
•  Runtime register block (includes all PME, SMI, GPIO, and other miscellaneous registers)
•  PME interface block
•  “Wake on Specific Key” logic
•  LED control logic
•  Low battery detection logic
•  Glue Logic
•  GPIO Pins
5.1.4         VBAT
There are two acceptable types of SCH5627P power supply configuration that fundamentally differ based on the need
for a backup battery connection to VBAT.

SCH5627P
5.1.4.1        TYPE 1
Type 1 configurations do not use a VBAT backup battery connection. Power supply requirements for Type 1 configu-
rations are as follows: VBAT is tied to VTR and VTR is connected to the suspend supply.
In this configuration internal components that utilize the VBAT power plane are switched internally to VTR using a Power
Multiplexer when VTR power is applied.
In this configuration, the state of VBAT-backed resources like the VBAT Powered RAM and the VBAT-backed status bits
are not preserved when VTR power is removed.
5.1.4.2        TYPE 2
Type 2 configurations use an un-switched VBAT backup battery connection. Power supply requirements for Type 2
configurations are as follows: VBAT is connected to an un-switched backup battery and VTR is connected to the sus-
pend supply.
In this configuration internal components that utilize the VBAT power plane are switched internally to VTR using a Power
Multiplexer when VTR power is applied.
APPLICATION NOTE: Microchip recommends removing all power to the device (VCC and VTR) before removing
                           and replacing the battery. In addition, upon removing the battery, ground the battery pin
                           through a resistor before replacing the battery.
5.2        Clocks
5.2.1        32.768KHZ CLOCK INPUT
The 32.768KHz CLK32 clock is a single-ended input. The system core logic will typically provide an accurate 32.768KHz
clock whenever RSMRST# is de-asserted. When the 32KHz clock input is not available, the internal 32KHz clock is
derived from an internal ring oscillator.
The CLK32 input is ensured glitch-free on VTR rise.
The 32K Clock domain is used for the EC Watchdog Timer and it provides a time base for blinking for the LED logic
described in Section 18.8, "LED Pins," on page 178.
5.2.2        14.318MHZ CLOCK INPUT
A PLL generates 96MHz clock from the 14.318 MHz input clock. This clock and its scaled-down versions are used in
the UART, parallel port, floppy disk controller and keyboard interface modules.
5.2.3        PCI CLOCK
The 33MHz clock is used in the LPC interface. The presence or absence of the PCI Clock can be monitored. The status
is readable by the EC in an internal status bit.
5.3        Reset
5.3.1        VBAT_POR
VBAT_POR is a pulse that is asserted at the rising edge of VTR if the coin cell is replaced while VTR is off, or if the
VBAT voltage falls below 1.25 V nominal while VTR rises above its operational threshold. No action is taken if the coin
cell is replaced, or the VBAT voltage falls below 1.25 V nominal while VTR is present
VBAT_POR is used to reset internal battery-powered registers. A Low_Bat status bit is also available for both PME and
SMI event generation.
5.3.2        NSYS_RST
nSYS_RST is the main system reset. It is asserted as soon as VTR power is applied.
nSYS_RST is also asserted as soon as the VTR power supply drops below its preset threshold.
5.3.3        VCC RESET
The VCC RESET signal is generated when the VCC voltage is below a threshold. VCC Reset is part of nSIO_RESET
and is also used in reset some individual registers as noted.

There are two indications of the state of the main power supply: the PWRGD_PS input pin and the internal VCC reset
generator, which monitors the voltage level of VCC. PWRGD_PS is not used as part of VCC RESET or nSIO_RESET,
but is used to gate SIO logical devices that are powered by an emulated VCC power supply. See Table 3-1, “Signal
Descriptions,” on page 11. for a list of all pins whose activity is gated by VCC RESET or PWRGD_PS.
5.3.4        PCI RESET#
The PCI RESET signal is generated whenever the LRESET# pin is low: PCI RESET# is part of nSIO_RESET.
5.3.5        NSIO_RESET
nSIO_RESET is a signal that is asserted when any one of nSYS_RST, VCC RESET or PCIRESET# is asserted.
In all blocks listed in Table 5-1, "Logical Devices Reset on nSIO_RESET", all registers within the block are reset on
nSIO_RESET except as noted in the block description.

through a series of read/write registers in the SCH5627P. Register access is accomplished through programmed I/O or
DMA LPC transfer cycles. All I/O transfer cycles are 8 bits wide. DMA transfer cycles can be 16-bits or 8-bits wide.
The Logical Devices located in the SCH5627P are identified in Table 4-1, “Host Logical Devices on SCH5627P,” on
page 26. The base addresses of logical devices with registers located in LPC I/O space can be moved via the configu-
ration registers located in the LPC Interface Configuration Register Space.
All configuration registers for the SCH5627P are accessed indirectly through the LPC I/O Configuration Register Port
(IOCR-Port.) The default I/O address is 2Eh and 2Fh, but the IOCR-Port can be relocated by either the host or the EC.
Detailed description of the SCH5627P Configuration Space is in Section 7.0, "Logical Device Configuration," on
page 38.

6.2.1       POWER DOMAIN
This block is powered by VTR. Although the block is not powered by VCC, the block is also controlled by PWRGD_PS.
When PWRGD_PS is de-asserted, the LPC bus pins are placed in the same state they assume when VTR is off.
LAD[3:0] and SERIRQ are tri-stated, LDRQ# is pulled high and LFRAME#, and LRESET# are gated high; see Table 6-
2, “LPC Bus Pin Behavior on Reset,” on page 32.The LPC block is also placed in a minimal power state.
See Section 5.9, "Registers," on page 43 for details on power domains.

SCH5627P
6.3        LPC Logical Device
Host accesses to Configuration Registers for each Logical Device on the SCH5627P are managed by a Configuration
block described in Section 7.0, "Logical Device Configuration," on page 38. Configuration registers are accessed
through the LPC IO Configuration Register Port.
6.3.1         LPC BUS INTERFACE
The SCH5627P communicates with the host over a Low Pin Count (LPC) interface. The LPC interface uses 3.3V sig-
naling. For detailed specifications, see the Intel Low Pin Count Specification and the PCI Local Bus Specification, Sec-
tion 4.2.2. The LPC Bus Interface is listed in Table 3-1, “Signal Descriptions,” on page 11
The following cycle types are supported by the LPC Bus protocol.
•  8-bit I/O Read
•  8-bit I/O Write
•  8-bit DMA Read (for Logical Devices which support 8-bit DMA)
•  8-bit DMA Write (for Logical Devices which support 8-bit DMA)
•  16-bit DMA Read (for Logical Devices which support 16-bit DMA)
•  16-bit DMA Write (for Logical Devices which support 16-bit DMA)
LPC transactions that access registers located on the SCH5627P will require a minimum of two wait SYNCs on the LPC
bus. The number of SYNCs may be larger if the internal bus is in use by the embedded controller, of if the data refer-
enced by the host is not present in a SCH5627P register. The SCH5627P always uses Long Wait SYNCs, rather than
Short Wait SYNCs, when responding to an LPC bus request.
Table 6-2, "LPC Bus Pin Behavior on Reset", shows the behavior of LPC outputs and input/outputs under reset condi-
tions in accordance with the Intel Low Pin Count Specification and the PCI Local Bus.

6.3.2         LPC I/O CYCLES
LPC 8-bit I/O Read cycles and 8-bit I/O Write cycles are mapped directly to registers in the SCH5627P.
6.3.3         LPC FIRMWARE HUB AND MEMORY CYCLES
The SCH5627P does not support LPC Firmware Hub cycles and LPC Memory cycles on the LPC Bus.
6.3.4         DMA READ AND WRITE CYCLES
DMA read cycles involve the transfer of data from the host (main memory) to the SCH5627P. DMA write cycles involve
the transfer of data from the SCH5627P to the host (main memory). Data will be coming from or going to a FIFO and
will have minimal Sync times. Data transfers to/from the SCH5627P are 1 or 2 bytes.
The mechanism to configure DMA Channels on the SCH5627P is described in Section 7.5, "DMA," on page 42 in the
Configuration chapter.
See the “Low Pin Count (LPC) Interface Specification” Reference, Section 6.4, for the field definitions and the sequence
of the DMA Read and Write cycles.
6.3.4.1        DMA Protocol
DMA on the LPC bus is handled through the use of the LDRQ# lines from the SCH5627P and special encodings on
LAD[3:0] from the host.
The DMA mechanism for the LPC bus is described in the “Low Pin Count (LPC) Interface Specification,” Revision 1.0.

                                                                                              SCH5627P
6.3.4.2         LDRQ# and SYNC Protocol
DMA transfers are requested through an LDRQ# assertion and ended through a SYNC field.
• Anytime a peripheral has a DMA or bus master channel that needs service, it encodes the channel number on the
   LDRQ# signal. There is no restriction of having to wait until the CHANNEL field is observed before encoding the
   next request. The only restrictions on LDRQ encoding are:
• The LDRQ# signal must be inactive for at least 1 clock before starting the next encoding.
• An LDRQ# encoding to request a transfer for a particular channel should not be attempted if one is still pending for
   that channel.
For single mode DMA transfers:
1.   The SCH5627P will use a sync encoding of 0000 to indicate that the data is valid. No data is permitted after the
     first byte (for channels 0-3) or word (for channels 5-7) since it is a single transfer.
2.   After the SCH5627P has observed the CHANNEL field for a particular DMA channel, it can start encoding the
     next request for that same channel, Requests for other channels can start at any time.
For demand mode DMA transfers:
1.   The SCH5627P will use a SYNC encoding of 1001 to indicate additional transfers required. This is functionally
     equivalent to (and replaces) sending another LDRQ encoding for that channel.
2.   The 0000 encoding is used to indicate that the data is valid but it is the last data transfer associated with that
     demand mode transfer. For example, on the 8th byte in a transfer (which clears a FIFO), the SCH5627P uses the
     0000 encoding for SYNC. On the 1st through the 7th bytes, it uses 1001 for SYNC.
3.   Once the SCH5627P has used LDRQ# to encode a request for a particular DMA channel to be active, it may not
     encode another active request for that channel until it has sent the 0000 encoding for SYNC to indicate no more
     data transfers are needed for that particular demand mode transfer for that channel.
   Note:      In 8-bit demand mode, even though the SYNC encoding used is 1001, the next cycle that comes down to
              the SCH5627P may not be a DMA cycle, it may be an I/O cycle.
See the “Low Pin Count (LPC) Interface Specification” Reference, Section 6.4.3 for a description of DMA request deas-
sertion.
For back-to-back transfers from a DMA channel, the following rule applies: The SCH5627P must not assert another
message for 8 LCLKs after a de-assertion is indicated through the SYNC field. This applies to transfers on the same
DMA channel.
6.3.4.3         Flushing The FIFO
Floppy Disk Controller: Flush at the end of a sector.
Parallel Port: Flush if no data for 2µs.
6.3.4.4         DMA Arbitration
The SCH5627P does not have to arbitrate internally, even though it supports more than one DMA channel. When more
than one device requests service, it sends one request out, then the other.
Arbitration for DMA channels is performed through the 8237 within the host. Once the host has won arbitration on behalf
of a DMA channel. It asserts LFRAME# on the LPC bus and begins the DMA transfer.
DMA Transfer Types
The DMA protocol is used for all transfer types, including single transfer mode, demand mode and verify mode. For
demand mode, the serialized requests will be back-to-back. For verify mode transfers, the SCH5627P should drive data
during the appropriate clocks; however, the host may ignore the values. A verify transfer is similar to a DMA write, where
the peripheral is transferring data to main memory. The indication from the host is the same as a DMA write, so the
peripheral will be driving data onto the LPC interface. However, the host will not transfer this data into main memory.
The LPC interface also supports increment mode.
The LPC interface does not support DMA channels being used on cascade mode (for emulating ISA masters). The LPC
interface does not support clock or decrement mode.
Channels 0-3 are 8 bit channels. Channels 5-7 are 16 bit channels.

SCH5627P
6.3.5       WAIT SYNC’S ON LPC
LPC cycles, with targets physically located in the SCH5627P, are completed with no more than two LPC Long WAIT
SYNC’s, provided the internal bus clock is configured to run at the default clock rate of 64.52MHz.
6.3.6       ERROR SYNC’S ON LPC
The SCH5627P does not issue ERROR SYNC cycles.
6.4       LPC Bus Configuration
The mapping from LPC Bus cycles to internal read/write cycles is managed by the LPC Logical Device. The mapping
is defined by a series of configuration registers which are defined in Section 7.0, "Logical Device Configuration," on
page 38, in Section 6.4, "LPC Bus Configuration," on page 34.
6.5       Serial Interrupts
The SCH5627P supports the serial interrupt scheme, which is adopted by several companies, to transmit interrupt infor-
mation to the system. The serial interrupt scheme adheres to the Serial IRQ Specification for PCI Systems Version 6.0.

6.5.1.1        IRQSER Cycle Control
There are two modes of operation for the IRQSER Start Frame.
Quiet (Active) Mode
Any device may initiate a Start Frame by driving the IRQSER low for one clock, while the IRQSER is Idle. After driving
low for one clock, the IRQSER must immediately be tri-stated without at any time driving high. A Start Frame may not
be initiated while the IRQSER is active. The IRQSER is Idle between Stop and Start Frames. The IRQSER is active
between Start and Stop Frames. This mode of operation allows the IRQSER to be Idle when there are no IRQ/Data
transitions which should be most of the time.
Once a Start Frame has been initiated, the host controller will take over driving the IRQSER low in the next clock and
will continue driving the IRQSER low for a programmable period of three to seven clocks. This makes a total low pulse
width of four to eight clocks. Finally, the host controller will drive the IRQSER back high for one clock then tri-state.
Any IRQSER Device (i.e., The SCH5627P) which detects any transition on an IRQ/Data line for which it is responsible
must initiate a Start Frame in order to update the host controller unless the IRQSER is already in an IRQSER Cycle and
the IRQ/Data transition can be delivered in that IRQSER Cycle.
Continuous (Idle) Mode
Only the Host controller can initiate a Start Frame to update IRQ/Data line information. All other IRQSER agents become
passive and may not initiate a Start Frame. IRQSER will be driven low for four to eight clocks by host controller. This
mode has two functions. It can be used to stop or idle the IRQSER or the host controller can operate IRQSER in a con-
tinuous mode by initiating a Start Frame at the end of every Stop Frame.

SCH5627P
An IRQSER mode transition can only occur during the Stop Frame. Upon reset, IRQSER bus is defaulted to continuous
mode, therefore only the host controller can initiate the first Start Frame. Slaves must continuously sample the Stop
Frames pulse width to determine the next IRQSER Cycle’s mode.
IRQSER Data Frame
Once a Start Frame has been initiated, the SCH5627P will watch for the rising edge of the Start Pulse and start counting
IRQ/Data Frames from there. Each IRQ/Data Frame is three clocks: Sample phase, Recovery phase, and Turn-around
phase. During the sample phase, the SCH5627P must drive the IRQSER (SIRQ pin) low, if and only if, its last detected
IRQ/Data value was low. If its detected IRQ/Data value is high, IRQSER must be left tri-stated. During the recovery
phase, the SCH5627P must drive the SERIRQ high, if and only if, it had driven the IRQSER low during the previous
sample phase. During the turn-around phase, the SCH5627P must tri-state the SERIRQ. The SCH5627P drives the
IRQSER line low at the appropriate sample point if its associated IRQ/Data line is low, regardless of which device initi-
ated the start frame.
The Sample phase for each IRQ/Data follows the low to high transition of the Start Frame pulse by a number of clocks
equal to the IRQ/Data Frame times three, minus one e.g. The IRQ5 Sample clock is the sixth IRQ/Data Frame, then the
sample phase is {(6 x 3) - 1 = 17} the seventeenth clock after the rising edge of the Start Pulse.

The SIRQ data frame will now support IRQ2 from a logical device; previously IRQSER Period 3 was reserved for use
by the System Management Interrupt (nSMI). When using Period 3 for IRQ2, the user should mask off the SCH5627P’s
SMI via the ESMI Mask Register. Likewise, when using Period 3 for nSMI, the user should not configure any logical
devices as using IRQ2.
IRQSER Period 14 is used to transfer IRQ13. Each Logical devices will have IRQ13 as a choice for their primary inter-
rupt.
Stop Cycle Control
Once all IRQ/Data Frames have completed, the host controller will terminate IRQSER activity by initiating a Stop Frame.
Only the host controller can initiate the Stop Frame. A Stop Frame is indicated when the IRQSER is low for two or three
clocks. If the Stop Frame’s low time is two clocks, then the next IRQSER cycle’s sampled mode is the Quiet mode; and
any IRQSER device may initiate a Start Frame in the second clock or more after the rising edge of the Stop Frame’s
pulse. If the Stop Frame’s low time is three clocks, then the next IRQSER cycle’s sampled mode is the continuous mode,
and only the host controller may initiate a Start Frame in the second clock or more after the rising edge of the Stop
Frame’s pulse.

Latency
Latency for IRQ/Data updates over the IRQSER bus in bridge-less systems with the minimum IRQ/Data Frames of 17
will range up to 96 clocks (3.84μS with a 25 MHz PCI Bus or 2.88μs with a 33 MHz PCI Bus). If one or more PCI to PCI
Bridge is added to a system, the latency for IRQ/Data updates from the secondary or tertiary buses will be a few clocks
longer for synchronous buses, and approximately double for asynchronous buses.
EOI/ISR Read Latency
Any serialized IRQ scheme has a potential implementation issue related to IRQ latency. IRQ latency could cause an
EOI or ISR Read to precede an IRQ transition that it should have followed. This could cause a system fault. The host
interrupt controller is responsible for ensuring that these latency issues are mitigated. The recommended solution is to
delay EOIs and ISR Reads to the interrupt controller by the same amount as the IRQSER Cycle latency in order to
ensure that these events do not occur out of order.
AC/DC Specification Issue
All IRQSER agents must drive/sample IRQSER synchronously related to the rising edge of the PCI bus clock. The
IRQSER (SIRQ) pin uses the electrical specification of the PCI bus. Electrical parameters will follow the PCI Specifica-
tion Section 4, sustained tri-state.
Reset and Initialization
The IRQSER bus uses LRESET as its reset signal and follows the PCI bus reset mechanism. The IRQSER pin is tri-
stated by all agents while LRESET is active. With reset, IRQSER slaves and bridges are put into the (continuous) Idle
mode. The host controller is responsible for starting the initial IRQSER cycle to collect system’s IRQ/Data default values.
The system then follows with the Continuous/Quiet mode protocol (Stop Frame pulse width) for subsequent IRQSER
cycles. It is the host controller’s responsibility to provide the default values to the 8259’s and other system logic before
the first IRQSER cycle is performed. For IRQSER system suspend, insertion, or removal application, the host controller
should be programmed into Continuous (IDLE) mode first. This is to make sure the IRQSER bus is in Idle state before
the system configuration changes.

SCH5627P
7.0        LOGICAL DEVICE CONFIGURATION
7.1        Description
The Configuration of the SCH5627P is very flexible and is based on the configuration architecture implemented in typical
Plug-and-Play components.
The SCH5627P is designed for motherboard designs in which the resources required by their components are known.
With its flexible resource allocation architecture, the SCH5627P allows the BIOS to assign resources at POST.
7.2        Logical Devices
Logical devices described in this section are peripherals that are located on the SCH5627P and are accessible to the
Host over the LPC bus.
Each logical device on the SCH5627P can have a set of Runtime Register and a set of Configuration Registers. The
distinction between Runtime and Configuration registers is that the Host can access Runtime Registers by a direct I/O
address, while it can only access Configuration Registers through a configuration port. The Logical Device Numbers for
the Logical Devices resident in the SCH5627P are listed in Table 4-1, “Host Logical Devices on SCH5627P,” on page 26.
7.3        Configuration Registers
7.3.1         HOST ACCESS PORT
The Host can access Configuration Registers through a port described in Section 7.3.2, on page 38. Host accesses
are limited to 8 bits. There are 48 8-bit Global Configuration Registers (at offsets 00h through 2Fh), plus up to 208 8-bit
registers associated with each Logical Device. The Logical Device is selected with the Logical Device Number Register
(Global Configuration Register 07h). The INDEX PORT is used to select a specific logical device register. These regis-
ters are then accessed through the DATA PORT. The Logical Device registers are accessible only when the device is
in the Configuration State.
Only two states are defined (Run and Configuration). In the Run State, the chip will always be ready to enter the Con-
figuration State.
The desired configuration registers are accessed in two steps:
a)    Write the index of the Logical Device Number Configuration Register (i.e., 07h) to the INDEX PORT and then
      write the number of the desired logical device to the DATA PORT
b)    Write the address of the desired configuration register within the logical device to the INDEX PORT and then write
      or read the configuration register through the DATA PORT.
   Note 1: If accessing the Global Configuration Registers, step (a) is not required.
          2: Any write to an undefined or reserved Configuration register is terminated normally on the LPC bus without
              any modification of state in the SCH5627P. Any read to an undefined or reserved Configuration register
              returns FFh.
7.3.2         PRIMARY CONFIGURATION ADDRESS DECODER
The logical devices are configured through three Configuration Access Ports (CONFIG, INDEX and DATA). The BIOS
uses these ports to initialize the logical devices at POST (Table 7-1).
The Base Address of the Configuration Access Ports is determined by the BAR that corresponds to Logical Device Ch,
the LPC Interface. The Configuration Access Port BAR is unique in that an LPC I/O access that matches this
BAR does not directly generate an internal read or write. Instead, the Device and Frame values in the BAR
indicates that the LPC I/O should be handled locally in the LPC Logical Device. The Configuration map will
issue an internal read or write, the results of which will be used to complete the LPC access.

7.3.2.1        Entering the Configuration State
The INDEX and DATA ports are effective only when the chip is in the Configuration State. The device enters the Con-
figuration State when the Config Entry Key is successfully written to the CONFIG PORT.
Config Entry Key = < 55h>
7.3.2.2        Exiting the Configuration State
The device exits the Configuration State when the following Config Exit Key is successfully written to the CONFIG PORT
address.
Config Exit Key = < AAh>
7.3.2.3        Read Accessing Configuration Port
The data read from the Configuration Port is undefined when not in the Configuration State. Writing the Config Entry
Key puts the chip in the Configuration State. Once in the Configuration State, reading the Configuration Port will return
the last value written to the Configuration Index. If no value was written the Configuration Port reads 00h.
7.3.3        CONFIGURATION SEQUENCE EXAMPLE
To program the configuration registers, the following sequence must be followed:
1. Enter Configuration State
2. Program the Configuration Registers
3. Exit Configuration State.

SCH5627P
7.3.4         CONFIGURATION REGISTER ADDRESS MAPPING
The INDEX PORT defines 256 bytes for configuration. The first 48 of these bytes are Global Configuration registers,
which reside in the first 48 bytes of the Configuration part of the address frame for Logical Device 3Fh. Values of INDEX
greater than 48 map into registers that are specific to the Logical Device specified in the Global Configuration Logical
Device Number Register 7h. These registers reside in upper 20 bytes of the Logical Device address frame. See Section
7.8.2, on page 46 for details.
7.4        Configuring Runtime Register Addresses
7.4.1         RUNTIME REGISTERS
Runtime Registers are registers that are accessible to the Host within the Host I/O address space. These Host I/O
accesses are all mapped into the SCH5627P internal address space onto devices located on the Host SPB. Runtime
registers all reside within the first 256 bytes of a 1KB Logical Device address frame. The Host accesses these registers
with 8-bit LPC I/O accesses. Each 8-bit I/O address is mapped into an 8-bit address in the internal address space, so
the first 256 bytes of the Logical Device frame can accommodate 256 LPC Runtime Registers per Logical Device. The
Host I/O addresses are determined by a block of Base Address Registers located in the LPC Logical Device. The
Embedded Controller can access all the Runtime Registers as well.
7.4.2         BASE ADDRESS REGISTERS
Each Logical Device has a Base Address Register (BAR). . On every LPC bus I/O access all Base Address Registers
are checked in parallel and if any matches the LPC I/O address the SCH5627P claims the bus cycle.
   Note:      Software should that insure that no two BARs map the same LPC I/O address.
Each BAR is 32 bits wide. The format of each BAR is summarized in Table 7-2, "Base Address Register Format".

MASK
These 7 bits are used to mask off address bits in the address match between an LPC I/O address and the Host Address
field of the BARs, as described in Section 7.4.3, "Mapping LPC I/O Addresses". A block of up to 128 8-bit registers can
be assigned to one base address.
FRAME
These 6 bits are used to specify a logical device frame number within a bus. This field is multiplied by 400h to provide
the frame address within the peripheral bus address. Frame values for frames corresponding to logical devices that are
not present on the SCH5627P are invalid.
DEVICE
This bit combined with FRAME constitute the Logical Device Number. DEVICE identifies the physical location of the
logical device. This bit should always be set to 0.

VALID
If this bit is 1, the BAR is valid and will participate in LPC matches. If it is 0 this BAR is ignored.
HOST_ADDRESS
These 16 bits are used to match LPC I/O addresses
7.4.3          MAPPING LPC I/O ADDRESSES
bit A Base Address Register will match an LPC I/O address, and thus the SCH5627P will claim the LPC bus cycle, if
the following relation holds:
                (LPC Address & ~BAR.MASK) == (BAR.LPC_Address & ~BAR.MASK) && (BAR.Valid == 1)
If one of the BARs match, the LPC cycle will be claimed by the SCH5627P. The Logical Device number for the matching
device is located in the Frame field of the BAR.When matching LPC I/O addresses, the SCH5627P ignores address bits
that correspond to ‘1b’ bits in the MASK field. For example, the Keyboard Controller (9042 Interface) Base Address Reg-
ister has 60h in the LPC Address field, the Frame field is 01h, and the MASK field is 04h. Because of the single ‘1b’ bit
in MASK, the BAR will match LPC I/O patterns in the form ‘00000000011000hb’, so both 60h and 64h will be matched
and claimed by the SCH5627P.
As another example, if a standard 16550 UART was located at LPC I/O address 238h, then the UART Receive buffer
would appear at address 238h and the Line Status register at 23Dh. If the BAR for the UART was set to 0238_8047h,
then the UART will be matched at I/O address 238h. UART1 is located in Logical Device 7h and the UART device
includes 8 registers.

Table 7-3, "Base Address Registers Default Values", lists the Base Address Registers for all logical devices on the
SCH5627P base chip. The columns to the right of the heavy line show the field definitions for the default values listed

   Note 7-1       All BAR registers except the BAR at 60h (LPC Logical Device 0Ch, the LPC Interface) are reset on
                  VTR POR, VCC RESET or LRESET. The BAR at 60h, LPC Logical Device 0Ch, is reset on VTR
                  POR only.
   Note 7-2       The FRAME and MASK fields for these Legacy devices are not used to determine which LPC I/O
                  addresses to claim. The address range match is maintained within the blocks themselves.
   Note 7-3       The Keyboard Controller contains registers are offset +0h, +4h (for the keyboard interface) and +32h
                  (for legacy GateA20/KBDRST). The default BAR for the keyboard controller, set for 60h, therefore
                  provides for the standard 60h/64h and 92h ports for keyboard control. Any address assigned to this
                  BAR must have bit[2] and bit[5] equal to 0.
7.5        DMA
7.5.1         DMA CONFIGURATION REGISTERS
The SCH5627P will claim an LPC DMA request if the requested channel is listed as valid in the Table 7-4, "DMA Con-
figuration Register Map". A channel is claimed if the DMA Configuration Register Format that corresponds to the chan-
nel is maps to a Logical Device. In order to execute the DMA operation, the SCH5627P translates the DMA access into
a bus read or write of the FIFO that corresponds to channel in question. The address of a DMA FIFO will always be one
of the first 16 32-aligned addresses within the DMA quadrant of a Logical Device frame.
The mapping in the DMA Configuration Register Map is used both for mapping LPC DMA I/O requests from the Host to
Logical Devices, as well as for mapping DMA requests from Logical Devices to the LPC Bus LDRQ# DMA request sig-
nal.
The Host can access the DMA Configuration registers with 8-bit accesses.

7.6         SERIRQ Interrupts
The SCH5627P can routes Logical Device interrupts onto SIRQ stream frames IRQ[0:15]. Routing is controlled by the
SIRQ Interrupt Configuration Registers. There is one SIRQ Interrupt Configuration Register for each accessible SIRQ
Frame (IRQ); all 16 registers are listed in Table 7-6, "SIRQ Interrupt Configuration Register Map". Each SIRQ Interrupt
Configuration Register controls a series of multiplexors which route to a single Logical Device interrupt as illustrated in
FIGURE 7-1: SIRQ Routing Internal Logical Devices on page 44. The format for each SIRQ Interrupt Configuration Reg-
ister is described in Table 7-7. Each Logical Device can have up to two LPC SERIRQ interrupts. When the SCH5627P
is polled by the host, each SIRQ frame routes the level of the Logical Device interrupt (selected by the corresponding
SIRQ Interrupt Configuration Register) to the SIRQ stream.
    Note:      Two Logical Devices cannot share a Serial IRQ.
The SIRQ Interrupt Configuration Register The Host can access the Interrupt Configuration registers with 8-bit
accesses.
    Note:      A SERIRQ interrupt is deactivated by setting an entry in the SIRQ Interrupt Configuration Register Map to
               FFh, which is the default reset value.

7.7       Configuration Register Reset Conditions
There are two reset conditions that will cause Configuration Registers on the SCH5627P to reset to default values. A
reset can be caused by a VTR Power On Reset condition (signaled by nSYS_RST) or by an nSIO_RESET condition.
The conditions that cause nSIO_RESET to be asserted are defined in Section 5.7.9, "nSIO_RESET," on page 38. In
addition, firmware running on the Embedded Controller can set all Configuration Registers to a default condition.

A separate set of control and configuration registers exist for each Logical Device and is selected with the Logical Device
# Register (07h). The Logical Devices are listed in Table 4-1, “Host Logical Devices on SCH5627P,” on page 26, and
the registers within each Logical Device are listed in Section 7.8.2, on page 46.
7.8.1         LOGICAL DEVICE ACTIVATION
Many Logical Devices have a register, called Activate, that is used to activate the Logical Device. When a Logical Device
is inactive, it is powered down. The format for the Activate Register is shown in Table 7-9, "Activate Register".
Activating a Logical Device does not cause the SCH5627P to claim LPC addresses associated with the device. Address
matching for all Logical Devices is enabled or disabled in the LPC Logical Device, as described in Section 7.4, "Config-
uring Runtime Register Addresses," on page 40.

When this bit is 1, the logical device is powered and functional. When this bit is 0, the logical device is powered down
and inactive.

   Note 7-6      R/W / R means that some parts of a register are read/write and some parts are read-only.
   Note 7-7      Resets are defined in Section 5.0, "Power, Clocks and Resets": nSYS_RST on page 37 and
                 nSIO_RESET on page 38.
   Note 7-8      The Activate register is reset on nSYS_RST if the Power bit in the Configuration Select Register is
                 0. It is reset on nSIO_RESET if the Power bit in the Configuration Select Register is 1.
7.9       Chip-Level (Global) Control/Configuration Registers
As with all Configuration Registers, the INDEX PORT is used to select a Global Configuration Register in the chip. The
DATA PORT is then used to access the selected register.

8.0       KEYBOARD CONTROLLER
8.1       General Description
The SCH5627P is a Super I/O and Universal Keyboard Controller that is designed for intelligent keyboard management
in desktop computer applications. The Universal Keyboard Controller uses an 8042 microcontroller CPU core. This sec-
tion concentrates on the SCH5627P enhancements to the 8042. For general information about the 8042, refer to the
“Hardware Description of the 8042” in the 8-Bit Embedded Controller Handbook.

SCH5627P
8.3        Interrupts
The Keyboard Interface can generate two Serial Interrupt Requests on the LPC bus. Each can be put on any of the
SERIRQ channels as configured by the SERIRQ configuration registers in the LPC host interface block. A Keyboard
interrupt is the Primary interrupt (chosen when the SELECT field in the LPC SERIRQ configuration register is 0) and a
mouse interrupt is the secondary interrupt (chosen when the SELECT field is 1).
The Keyboard interrupt and Mouse interrupt signals are also routed to GIRQ15, as the KBC_KIRQ and KBC_MIRQ bits,
so the EC may also respond to keyboard controller interrupts.
8.4        Keyboard Interface
The SCH5627P LPC interface is functionally compatible with the 8042 style host interface. It consists of the D0-7 data
signals; the read and write signals and the Status register, Input Data register, and Output Data register. Table 8-1 shows
how the interface decodes the control signals. In addition to the above signals, the host interface includes keyboard and
mouse IRQs.

   Note:       These registers consist of three separate 8-bit registers. Status, Data/Command Write and Data Read.
Keyboard Data Write
bit This is an 8 bit write only register. When written, the C/D status bit of the status register is cleared to zero and the
IBF bit is set.
Keyboard Data Read
This is an 8 bit read only register. If enabled by “ENABLE FLAGS”, when read, the KIRQ output is cleared and the OBF
flag in the status register is cleared. If not enabled, the KIRQ and/or AUXOBF1 must be cleared in software.
Keyboard Command Write
This is an 8 bit write only register. When written, the C/D status bit of the status register is set to one and the IBF bit is set.
Keyboard Status Read
This is an 8 bit read only register. Refer to the description of the Status Register for more information.
CPU-to-Host Communication
The SCH5627P CPU can write to the Output Data register via register DBB. A write to this register automatically sets
Bit 0 (OBF) in the Status register. See Table 8-2.
TABLE 8-2:            HOST INTERFACE FLAGS
 8042 INSTRUCTION                       FLAG
 OUT DBB                                Set OBF, and, if enabled, the KIRQ output signal goes high
Host-to-CPU Communication
The host system can send both commands and data to the Input Data register. The CPU differentiates between com-
mands and data by reading the value of Bit 3 of the Status register. When bit 3 is “1”, the CPU interprets the register
contents as a command. When bit 3 is “0”, the CPU interprets the register contents as data. During a host write opera-
tion, bit 3 is set to “1” if SA2 = 1 or reset to “0” if SA2 = 0.

                                                                                                 SCH5627P
KIRQ
If “EN FLAGS” has been executed and P24 is set to a one: the OBF flag is gated onto KIRQ. The KIRQ signal can be
connected to system interrupt to signify that the SCH5627P CPU has written to the output data register via “OUT
DBB,A”. If P24 is set to a zero, KIRQ is forced low. On power-up, after a valid RST pulse has been delivered to the
device, KIRQ is reset to 0. KIRQ will normally reflects the status of writes “DBB”. (KIRQ is normally selected as IRQ1
for keyboard support.)
If “EN FLAGS” has not been executed: KIRQ can be controlled by writing to P24. Writing a zero to P24 forces KIRQ low;
a high forces KIRQ high.
MIRQ
If “EN FLAGS” has been executed and P25 is set to a one:; IBF is inverted and gated onto MIRQ. The MIRQ signal can
be connected to system interrupt to signify that the SCH5627P CPU has read the DBB register. If “EN FLAGS” has not
been executed, MIRQ is controlled by P25, Writing a zero to P25 forces MIRQ low, a high forces MIRQ high. (MIRQ is
normally selected as IRQ12 for mouse support).
Gate A20
A general purpose P21 is used as a software controlled Gate A20 or user defined output.
8.5        External Keyboard and Mouse Interface
bit Industry-standard PC-AT-compatible keyboards employ a two-wire, bidirectional TTL interface for data transmission.
Several sources also supply PS/2 mouse products that employ the same type of interface. To facilitate system expan-
sion, the SCH5627P provides four signal pins that may be used to implement this interface directly for an external key-
board and mouse.
bit The SCH5627P has four high-drive, open-drain output, bidirectional port pins that can be used for external serial
interfaces, such as external keyboard and PS/2-type mouse interfaces. They are KCLK, KDAT, MCLK, and MDAT. P26
is inverted and output as KCLK. The KCLK pin is connected to TEST0. P27 is inverted and output as KDAT. The KDAT
pin is connected to P10. P23 is inverted and output as MCLK. The MCLK pin is connected to TEST1. P22 is inverted
and output as MDAT. The MDAT pin is connected to P11.
    Note:     External pull-ups may be required.
8.5.1         KEYBOARD/MOUSE SWAP BIT
There is a Kbd/mouse Swap bit in the Keyboard Select configuration register located at F1h in Logical Device 1. This
bit can be used to swap the keyboard and mouse clock and data pins into/out of the 8042. The default value of this bit
is ‘0’ on VCC RESET, VTR POR and PCI Reset. This bit is defined as follows:
1 = internally swap the KCLK pin and the MCLK pin, and the KDAT pin and the MDAT pin into/out of the 8042.
0 = do not swap the keyboard and mouse clock and data pins
8.5.2         KEYBOARD POWER MANAGEMENT
The keyboard provides support for two power-saving modes: soft power-down mode and hard power-down mode. In
soft power-down mode, the clock to the ALU is stopped but the timer/counter and interrupts are still active. In hard power
down mode the clock to the 8042 is stopped.
Soft Power-Down Mode
This mode is entered by executing a HALT instruction. The execution of program code is halted until either RESET is
driven active or a data byte is written to the DBBIN register by a master CPU. If this mode is exited using the interrupt,
and the IBF interrupt is enabled, then program execution resumes with a CALL to the interrupt routine, otherwise the
next instruction is executed. If it is exited using RESET then a normal reset sequence is initiated and program execution
starts from program memory location 0.
Hard Power-Down Mode
This mode is entered by executing a STOP instruction. The oscillator is stopped by disabling the oscillator driver cell.
When either RESET is driven active or a data byte is written to the DBBIN register by a master CPU, this mode will be
exited (as above). However, as the oscillator cell will require an initialization time, either RESET must be held active for
sufficient time to allow the oscillator to stabilize. Program execution will resume as above.
8.5.3         INTERRUPTS
The SCH5627P provides the two 8042 interrupts: IBF and the Timer/Counter Overflow.

8.5.4        MEMORY CONFIGURATIONS
The SCH5627P provides 2K of on-chip ROM and 256 bytes of on-chip RAM.
8.5.5        REGISTER DEFINITIONS
Host I/F Data Register
The Input Data register and Output Data register are each 8 bits wide. A write to this 8 bit register will load the Keyboard
Data Read Buffer, set the OBF flag and set the KIRQ output if enabled. A read of this register will read the data from the
Keyboard Data or Command Write Buffer and clear the IBF flag. Refer to the KIRQ and Status register descriptions for
more information.
Host I/F Status Register
The Status register is 8 bits wide.
Table 8-3 shows the contents of the Status register.
TABLE 8-3:          STATUS REGISTER

Status Register
This register is cleared on a reset. This register is read-only for the Host and read/write by the SCH5627P CPU.
UD     Writable by SCH5627P CPU. These bits are user-definable.
C/D    (Command Data)-This bit specifies whether the input data register contains data or a command (0 = data, 1 =
       command). During a host data/command write operation, this bit is set to “1” if SA2 = 1 or reset to “0” if SA2 = 0.
IBF    (Input Buffer Full)- This flag is set to 1 whenever the host system writes data into the input data register. Setting
       this flag activates the SCH5627P CPU’s nIBF (MIRQ) interrupt if enabled. When the SCH5627P CPU reads the
       input data register (DBB), this bit is automatically reset and the interrupt is cleared. There is no output pin asso-
       ciated with this internal signal.
OBF (Output Buffer Full) - This flag is set to whenever the SCH5627P CPU write to the output data register (DBB).
       When the host system reads the output data register, this bit is automatically reset.
8.5.6 EXTERNAL CLOCK SIGNAL
The SCH5627P Keyboard Controller clock source is a 12 MHz clock generated from the internal 96MHz PLL. The reset
pulse must last for at least 24 16 MHz clock periods. The pulse-width requirement applies to both internally (VCC
RESET) and externally generated reset signals. In power-down mode, the external clock signal is not loaded by the chip.
8.5.7        DEFAULT RESET CONDITIONS
The SCH5627P has one source of hardware reset for the keyboard controller: an external reset via the LRESET# pin.
Refer to Table 8-4 for the effect of each type of reset on the internal registers.

8.5.7.2         Port 92 Fast GATEA20 and Keyboard Reset
Port 92 Register
This port can only be read or written if Port 92 has been enabled via bit 2 of the KRST_GA20 Register (Logical Device
1, F0h) set to 1.
This register is used to support the alternate reset (nALT_RST) and alternate A20 (ALT_A20) functions.

 0             Alternate System Reset. This read/write bit provides an alternate system reset function. This function
               provides an alternate means to reset the system CPU to effect a mode switch from Protected Virtual
               Address Mode to the Real Address Mode. This provides a faster means of reset than is provided by
               the Keyboard controller. This bit is set to a 0 by a system reset. Writing a 1 to this bit will cause the
               nALT_RST signal to pulse active (low) for a minimum of 1 µs after a delay of 500 ns. Before another
               nALT_RST pulse can be generated, this bit must be written back to a 0.

Bit 0 of Port 92, which generates the nALT_RST signal, is used to reset the CPU under program control. This signal is
AND’ed together externally with the reset signal (KBDRST#) from the keyboard controller to provide a software means
of resetting the CPU. This provides a faster means of reset than is provided by the keyboard controller. Writing a 1 to
bit 0 in the Port 92 Register causes this signal to pulse low for a minimum of 7µs, after a delay of a minimum of 15µs.
Before another nALT_RST pulse can be generated, bit 0 must be set to 0 either by a system reset of a write to Port 92.
Upon reset, this signal is driven inactive high (bit 0 in the Port 92 Register is set to 0).
If Port 92 is enabled, i.e., bit 2 of KRST_GA20 is set to 1, then a pulse is generated by writing a 1 to bit 0 of the Port 92
Register and this pulse is AND’ed with the pulse generated from the 8042. This pulse is output on pin KRESET and its
polarity is controlled by the GPI/O polarity configuration.

Bit 1 of Port 92, the ALT_A20 signal, is used to force nA20M to the CPU low for support of real mode compatible soft-
ware. This signal is externally OR’ed with the A20GATE signal from the keyboard controller and CPURST to control the
nA20M input of the CPU. Writing a 0 to bit 1 of the Port 92 Register forces ALT_A20 low. ALT_A20 low drives nA20M
to the CPU low, if A20GATE from the keyboard controller is also low. Writing a 1 to bit 1 of the Port 92 Register forces
ALT_A20 high. ALT_A20 high drives nA20M to the CPU high, regardless of the state of A20GATE from the keyboard
controller. Upon reset, this signal is driven low.

The KLATCH and MLATCH bits are located in the KRST_GA20 register, in Logical Device 1 at F0h.
These bits are defined as follows:
Bit[4]: MLATCH – Mouse Interrupt latch control bit. 0=MINT is the 8042 MINT ANDed with Latched MINT (default),
        1=MINT is the latched 8042 MINT.
Bit[3]: KLATCH – Keyboard Interrupt latch control bit. 0=KINT is the 8042 KINT ANDed with Latched KINT (default),
        1=KINT is the latched 8042 KINT.
See Section 8.7, "Detailed Description of Configuration Registers," on page 61 for a description of this register.
8.5.8        KEYBOARD AND MOUSE PME GENERATION
The SCH5627P sets the associated PME Status bits when the following conditions occur:
• Active (falling) Edge on Keyboard Data Signal (KDAT)
• Active (falling) Edge on Mouse Data Signal (MDAT)
These events can cause a PME to be generated if the associated PME Wake Enable register bit and the global PME_EN
bit are set. Refer Section 16.0, "Runtime Registers," on page 149 for details on the PME Status and Enable registers.
Both the keyboard interrupt and mouse interrupt PMEs can be generated when the part is powered by VCC. The key-
board data and mouse data PMEs can be generated both when the part is powered by VCC, and VTR (VCC=0).
When using the keyboard and mouse data signals for wakeup, it may be necessary to isolate the keyboard signals
(KCLK, KDAT, MCLK, MDAT) from the 8042 prior to entering certain system sleep states. This is due to the fact that the
normal operation of the 8042 can prevent the system from entering a sleep state or trigger false PME events. The
SCH5627P has “isolation” bits for the keyboard and mouse signals, which allow the keyboard and mouse data signals
to go into the wakeup logic but block the clock and data signals from the 8042. These bits may be used anytime it is
necessary to isolate the 8042 keyboard and mouse signals from the 8042 before entering a system sleep state.
See the Microchip Application Note titled “Keyboard and Mouse Wakeup Functionality” for more information.
The bits used to isolate the keyboard and mouse signals from the 8042 are located in Logical Device 1, Register F0h
(KRST_GA20) and are defined below. These bits reset on VTR POR only.
Bit[6]M_ISO. Enables/disables isolation of mouse signals into 8042. Does not affect the MDAT signal to The mouse
wakeup (PME) logic.
1 = block mouse clock and data signals into 8042
0 = do not block mouse clock and data signals into 8042
 2009 - 2015 Microchip Technology Inc.                                                           DS00001996A-page 59


SCH5627P
Bit[5] K_ISO. Enables/disables isolation of keyboard signals into 8042. Does not affect the KDAT signal to the keyboard
wakeup (PME) logic.
1 = block keyboard clock and data signals into 8042
0 = do not block keyboard clock and data signals into 8042
When the keyboard and/or mouse isolation bits are used, it may be necessary to reset the 8042 upon exiting the sleep
state. If either of the isolation bits are set prior to entering a sleep state where VCC goes inactive (S3-S5), then the 8042
must be reset upon exiting the sleep mode. Write 40h to global configuration register 2Ch to reset the 8042. The 8042
must then be taken out of reset by writing 00h to register 2Ch since the bit that resets the 8042 is not self-clearing. Cau-
tion: Bit 6 of configuration register 2Ch is used to put the 8042 into reset - do not set any of the other bits in register 2Ch,
as this may produce undesired results.
It is not necessary to reset the 8042 if the isolation bits are used for a sleep state where VCC does not go inactive (S1,
S2).
When the external keyboard and external mouse are powered up, the KDAT and MDAT lines are driven low. This sets
the KBD bit (D3) and the MOUSE bit (D4) of the PME Wake Status Register since the KDAT and MDAT signals cannot
be isolated internal to the part. This causes an IO_PME# to be generated if the keyboard and/or mouse PME events
are enabled. Note that the keyboard and mouse isolation bits only prevent the internal 8042 in the part from setting these
status bits.
Case 1: Keyboard and/or Mouse Powered by VTR
The KBD and/or MOUSE status bits will be set upon a VTR POR if the keyboard and/or mouse are powered by VTR.
In this case, an IO_PME# will not be generated, since the keyboard and mouse PME enable bits are reset to zero on a
VTR POR. The BIOS software needs to clear these PME status bits after power-up.
Case 2: Keyboard and/or Mouse Powered by VCC
The KBD and/or MOUSE status bits will be set upon a VCC POR if the keyboard and/or mouse are powered by VCC.
In this case, an IO_PME# will be generated if the enable bits were set for wakeup, since the keyboard and mouse PME
enable bits are VTR powered. If the keyboard and mouse are powered by VCC, the enable bits for keyboard and mouse
events should be cleared prior to entering a sleep state where VCC is removed (i.e., S3) to prevent a false PME from
being generated. In this case, the keyboard and mouse should only be used as PME and/or wake events from the S0
and/or S1 states. The BIOS software needs to clear these PME status bits after power-up.
8.6        ‘Wake on Specific Key’ Option
bit The SCH5627P has logic to detect a single keyboard scan code for wakeup (PME generation). The scan code is
programmed onto the Keyboard Scan Code Register, a runtime register at offset 26h from the base address located in
the primary base I/O address in Logical Device A. This register is powered by VTR and reset on VTR POR.
bit The PME status bit for this event is located in the PME_STS1 register at bit 5 and the PME enable bit for this event
is located in the PME_EN1 register at bit 5. See Section 16.3.3, "PME_STS1 Register," on page 152 and Section 16.3.6,
"PME_EN1 Register," on page 155 for a definition of these registers.
bit Data transmissions from the keyboard consist of an 11-bit serial data stream. A logic 1 is sent at an active high level.
The following table shows the functions of the bits.

The process to find a match for the scan code stored in the Keyboard Scan Code register is as follows:
Begin sampling the data at the first falling edge of the keyboard clock following a period where the clock line has been
high for 115-145usec. The data at this first clock edge is the start bit. The first data bit follows the start bit (clock 2).
Sample the data on each falling edge of the clock. Store the eight bits following the stop bit to compare with the scan
code stored in the Keyboard Scan Code register. Sample the comparator within 100usec of the falling edge of clock 9
(for example, at clock 10).
Sample the parity bit and check that the 8 data bits plus the parity bit always have an odd number of 1’s (odd parity).
Repeat until a match is found. If the 8 data bits match the scan code stored in the Keyboard Scan Code register and the
parity is correct, then it is considered a match. When a match is found and if the stop bit is 1, set the event status bit (bit
5 of the PME_STS1 register) to ‘1’ within 100usec of the falling edge of clock 10.
The state machine will reset after 11 clocks and the process will restart. The process will continue until it is shut off by
setting the SPEKEY_EN bit (see description below).
The state machine will reset if there is a period where the clock remains high for more than one keyboard clock period
(115-145usec) in the middle of the transmission (i.e., before clock 11). This is to prevent the generation of a false PME.
The SPEKEY_EN bit at bit 1 of the SPEKEY Configuration register at F0h in Logical Device A is used to control the
“wake-on-specific feature. This bit is used to turn the logic for this feature on and off. The logic will draw no power when
disabled. The bit is defined as follows:
0 = “Wake on specific key” logic is on (default)
1 = “Wake on specific key” logic is off
   Note:      The generation of a PME for this event is controlled by the PME enable bit (located in the PME_EN1 reg-
              ister at bit 5) when the logic for feature is turned on.

SCH5627P
9.0       SERIAL PORT (UART)
9.1       General Description
The SCH5627P incorporates two full function UARTs. Each UART is compatible with the 16450, the 16450 ACE regis-
ters and the 16C550A. The UARTs perform serial-to-parallel conversion on received characters and parallel-to-serial
conversion on transmit characters. Two sets of baud rates are provided. When the 1.8432 MHz source clock is selected,
standard baud rates from 50 to 115.2K are available. When the source clock is 32.26 MHz, baud rates from 126K to
2,016K are available. The character options are programmable for 1 start; 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits; even, odd, sticky or no
parity; and prioritized interrupts. The UART contains a programmable baud rate generator that is capable of dividing the
input clock or crystal by a number from 1 to 65535. The UART is also capable of supporting the MIDI data rate. Refer
to the Configuration Registers for information on disabling, powerdown and changing the base address of the UART.
The interrupt from a UART is enabled by programming OUT2 of the UART to a logic “1”. OUT2 being a logic “0” disables
the UART's interrupt. The UART is accessible by both the Host and the EC.
9.1.1        FEATURES
•  Programmable word length, stop bits and parity
•  Programmable baud rate generator
•  Interrupt generator
•  Loop-back mode
•  Interface registers
•  16-byte Transmit FIFO
•  16-byte Receive FIFO
•  Multiple clock sources

9.2       Power, Clocks and Reset
9.2.1        POWER DOMAIN
This block is powered by the VTR Power Supply.
See Section 5.9, "Registers," on page 43 for details on power domains.
9.2.2        CLOCKS
Registers in this block are clocked at the Host Bus Clock rate which is derived by the master clock MCLK. Baud rates
are derived from 1.8432MHz clock input. The 1.8432MHz. is itself derived from either MCLK or sourced from the 96MHz
PLL. An alternate 32.26MHz clock, derived from MCLK, is also available as a clock input.
See Section 5.5, "Clock Sources," on page 32 for details on clocks.
   Note:     When the CLK_SRC bit in the Configuration Select Register is ‘1’, the baud clock is derived from the
             96MHz PLL.
9.2.3        RESET

and the Interrupt Identification Register (IIR) on page 71 for a description of interrupt generation. This interrupt is routed
to the SIRQ block (see SERIRQ Configuration Registers on page 43).
9.4       Registers
Table 9-3 is a register summary for one instance of the Serial Port (UART). The LPC I/O address for each Run-Time
Register is described below as an offset from its Base Address Register. Each Configuration register access through
the Host Access Port is via its LDN indicated in Table 4-1, “Host Logical Devices on SCH5627P,” on page 26 and its
Host Access Port index which is described as “Host Config Index” in the tables below.

Received Data Byte
This register holds the received incoming data byte. Bit 0 is the least significant bit, which is transmitted and received
first. Received data is double buffered; this uses an additional shift register to receive the serial data stream and convert
it to a parallel 8 bit word which is transferred to the Receive Buffer register. The shift register is not accessible.

Transmit Data Byte
This register contains the data byte to be transmitted. The transmit buffer is double buffered, utilizing an additional shift
register (not accessible) to convert the 8 bit data word to a serial format. This shift register is loaded from the Transmit
Buffer when the transmission of the previous byte is complete.

The lower four bits of this register control the enables of the five interrupt sources of the Serial Port interrupt. It is possible
to totally disable the interrupt system by resetting bits 0 through 3 of this register. Similarly, setting the appropriate bits
of this register to a high, selected interrupts can be enabled. Disabling the interrupt system inhibits the Interrupt Identi-
fication Register and disables any Serial Port interrupt out of the SCH5627P. All other system functions operate in their
normal manner, including the Line Status and MODEM Status Registers. The contents of the Interrupt Enable Register
are described below.
ERDAI
This bit enables the Received Data Available Interrupt (and timeout interrupts in the FIFO mode) when set to logic “1”.
ETHREI
This bit enables the Transmitter Holding Register Empty Interrupt when set to logic “1”.
ELSI
This bit enables the Received Line Status Interrupt when set to logic “1”. The error sources causing the interrupt are
Overrun, Parity, Framing and Break. The Line Status Register must be read to determine the source.
EMSI
This bit enables the MODEM Status Interrupt when set to logic “1”. This is caused when one of the Modem Status Reg-
ister bits changes state.

This is a write only register at the same location as the IIR.
   Note:      DMA is not supported.
EXRF
Enable XMIT and RECV FIFO. Setting this bit to a logic “1” enables both the XMIT and RCVR FIFOs. Clearing this bit
to a logic “0” disables both the XMIT and RCVR FIFOs and clears all bytes from both FIFOs. When changing from FIFO
Mode to non-FIFO (16450) mode, data is automatically cleared from the FIFOs. This bit must be a 1 when other bits in
this register are written to or they will not be properly programmed.
Clear RECV FIFO
Setting this bit to a logic “1” clears all bytes in the RCVR FIFO and resets its counter logic to “0”. The shift register is not
cleared. This bit is self-clearing.
Clear XMIT FIFO
Setting this bit to a logic “1” clears all bytes in the XMIT FIFO and resets its counter logic to “0”. The shift register is not
cleared. This bit is self-clearing.
RECV FIFO Trigger Level
These bits are used to set the trigger level for the RCVR FIFO interrupt.

By accessing this register, the host CPU can determine the highest priority interrupt and its source. Four levels of priority
interrupt exist. They are in descending order of priority:
1.    Receiver Line Status (highest priority)
2.    Received Data Ready
3.    Transmitter Holding Register Empty
4.    MODEM Status (lowest priority)

SCH5627P
Information indicating that a prioritized interrupt is pending and the source of that interrupt is stored in the Interrupt Iden-
tification Register (refer to Table 9-11). When the CPU accesses the IIR, the Serial Port freezes all interrupts and indi-
cates the highest priority pending interrupt to the CPU. During this CPU access, even if the Serial Port records new
interrupts, the current indication does not change until access is completed. The contents of the IIR are described below.
IPEND
This bit can be used in either a hardwired prioritized or polled environment to indicate whether an interrupt is pending.
When bit 0 is a logic “0”, an interrupt is pending and the contents of the IIR may be used as a pointer to the appropriate
internal service routine. When bit 0 is a logic “1”, no interrupt is pending.
IntID
These three bits of the IIR are used to identify the highest priority interrupt pending as indicated by Table 9-11. In non-
FIFO mode, Bit[3] is a logic “0”. In FIFO mode Bit[3] is set along with Bit[2] when a timeout interrupt is pending.

Enable Parity
Parity Enable bit. When bit 3 is a logic “1”, a parity bit is generated (transmit data) or checked (receive data)
between the last data word bit and the first stop bit of the serial data. (The parity bit is used to generate an even or odd
number of 1s when the data word bits and the parity bit are summed).

Parity Select
Even Parity Select bit. When bit 3 is a logic “1” and bit 4 is a logic “0”, an odd number of logic “1”'s is transmitted or
checked in the data word bits and the parity bit. When bit 3 is a logic “1” and bit 4 is a logic “1” an even number of bits
is transmitted and checked.
Stick Parity
Stick Parity bit. When parity is enabled it is used in conjunction with bit 4 to select Mark or Space Parity. When LCR bits
3, 4 and 5 are 1 the Parity bit is transmitted and checked as a 0 (Space Parity). If bits 3 and 5 are 1 and bit 4 is a 0, then
the Parity bit is transmitted and checked as 1 (Mark Parity). If bit 5 is 0 Stick Parity is disabled.
Bit 3 is a logic “1” and bit 5 is a logic “1”, the parity bit is transmitted and then detected by the receiver in the opposite
state indicated by bit 4.
Break Control
Set Break Control bit. When bit 6 is a logic “1”, the transmit data output (TXD) is forced to the Spacing or logic “0” state
and remains there (until reset by a low level bit 6) regardless of other transmitter activity. This feature enables the Serial
Port to alert a terminal in a communications system.
DLAB
Divisor Latch Access Bit (DLAB). It must be set high (logic “1”) to access the Divisor Latches of the Baud Rate Generator
during read or write operations. It must be set low (logic “0”) to access the Receiver Buffer Register, the Transmitter
Holding Register, or the Interrupt Enable Register.

This 8-bit register controls the interface with the MODEM or data set (or device emulating a MODEM). The contents of
the MODEM control register are described below.
DTR
This bit controls the Data Terminal Ready (nDTR) output. When bit 0 is set to a logic “1”, the nDTR output is forced to
a logic “0”. When bit 0 is a logic “0”, the nDTR output is forced to a logic “1”.
RTS
This bit controls the Request To Send (nRTS) output. Bit 1 affects the nRTS output in a manner identical to that
described above for bit 0.
OUT1
This bit controls the Output 1 (OUT1) bit. This bit does not have an output pin and can only be read or written by the CPU.

OUT2
Output 2 (OUT2). This bit is used to enable an UART interrupt. When OUT2 is a logic “0”, the serial port interrupt output
is forced to a high impedance state - disabled. When OUT2 is a logic “1”, the serial port interrupt outputs are enabled.
LOOPBACK
This bit provides the loopback feature for diagnostic testing of the Serial Port. When bit 4 is set to logic “1”, the following
occur:
1.    The TXD is set to the Marking State (logic “1”).
2.    The receiver Serial Input (RXD) is disconnected.
3.    The output of the Transmitter Shift Register is “looped back” into the Receiver Shift Register input.
4.    All MODEM Control inputs (nCTS, nDSR, nRI and nDCD) are disconnected.
5.    The four MODEM Control outputs (nDTR, nRTS, OUT1 and OUT2) are internally connected to the four MODEM
      Control inputs (nDSR, nCTS, RI, DCD).
6.    The Modem Control output pins are forced inactive high.
7.    Data that is transmitted is immediately received.
This feature allows the processor to verify the transmit and receive data paths of the Serial Port. In the diagnostic mode,
the receiver and the transmitter interrupts are fully operational. The MODEM Control Interrupts are also operational but
the interrupts' sources are now the lower four bits of the MODEM Control Register instead of the MODEM Control inputs.
The interrupts are still controlled by the Interrupt Enable Register.

Data Ready
Data Ready (DR). It is set to a logic “1” whenever a complete incoming character has been received and transferred
into the Receiver Buffer Register or the FIFO. Bit 0 is reset to a logic “0” by reading all of the data in the Receive Buffer
Register or the FIFO.
Overrun Error
Overrun Error (OE). Bit 1 indicates that data in the Receiver Buffer Register was not read before the next character was
transferred into the register, thereby destroying the previous character. In FIFO mode, an overrun error will occur only
when the FIFO is full and the next character has been completely received in the shift register, the character in the shift
register is overwritten but not transferred to the FIFO. The OE indicator is set to a logic “1” immediately upon detection
of an overrun condition, and reset whenever the Line Status Register is read.

SCH5627P
Parity Error
Parity Error (PE). Bit 2 indicates that the received data character does not have the correct even or odd parity, as
selected by the even parity select bit. The PE is set to a logic “1” upon detection of a parity error and is reset to a logic
“0” whenever the Line Status Register is read. In the FIFO mode this error is associated with the particular character in
the FIFO it applies to. This error is indicated when the associated character is at the top of the FIFO.
Frame Error
Framing Error (FE). Bit 3 indicates that the received character did not have a valid stop bit. Bit 3 is set to a logic “1”
whenever the stop bit following the last data bit or parity bit is detected as a zero bit (Spacing level). The FE is reset to
a logic “0” whenever the Line Status Register is read. In the FIFO mode this error is associated with the particular char-
acter in the FIFO it applies to. This error is indicated when the associated character is at the top of the FIFO. The Serial
Port will try to resynchronize after a framing error. To do this, it assumes that the framing error was due to the next start
bit, so it samples this 'start' bit twice and then takes in the 'data'.
Break Interrupt
Break Interrupt (BI). Bit 4 is set to a logic “1” whenever the received data input is held in the Spacing state (logic “0”) for
longer than a full word transmission time (that is, the total time of the start bit + data bits + parity bits + stop bits). The
BI is reset after the CPU reads the contents of the Line Status Register. In the FIFO mode this error is associated with
the particular character in the FIFO it applies to. This error is indicated when the associated character is at the top of
the FIFO. When break occurs only one zero character is loaded into the FIFO. Restarting after a break is received,
requires the serial data (RXD) to be logic “1” for at least 1/2 bit time.
Bits 1 through 4 are the error conditions that produce a Receiver Line Status Interrupt BIT 3
   Note 9-10       whenever any of the corresponding conditions are detected and the interrupt is enabled
Transmit Empty
Transmitter Holding Register Empty (THRE). Bit 5 indicates that the Serial Port is ready to accept a new character for
transmission. In addition, this bit causes the Serial Port to issue an interrupt when the Transmitter Holding Register inter-
rupt enable is set high. The THRE bit is set to a logic “1” when a character is transferred from the Transmitter Holding
Register into the Transmitter Shift Register. The bit is reset to logic “0” whenever the CPU loads the Transmitter Holding
Register. In the FIFO mode this bit is set when the XMIT FIFO is empty, it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to
the XMIT FIFO. Bit 5 is a read only bit.
Transmit Error
Transmitter Empty (TEMT). Bit 6 is set to a logic “1” whenever the Transmitter Holding Register (THR) and Transmitter
Shift Register (TSR) are both empty. It is reset to logic “0” whenever either the THR or TSR contains a data character.
Bit 6 is a read only bit. In the FIFO mode this bit is set whenever the THR and TSR are both empty,
FIFO Error
This bit is permanently set to logic “0” in the 450 mode. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set to a logic “1” when there is at
least one parity error, framing error or break indication in the FIFO. This bit is cleared when the LSR is read if there are
no subsequent errors in the FIFO.

This 8 bit register provides the current state of the control lines from the MODEM (or peripheral device). In addition to
this current state information, four bits of the MODEM Status Register (MSR) provide change information.
These bits are set to logic “1” whenever a control input from the MODEM changes state. They are reset to logic “0” when-
ever the MODEM Status Register is read.
CTS
Delta Clear To Send (DCTS). Bit 0 indicates that the nCTS input to the chip has changed state since the last time the
MSR was read.
DSR
Delta Data Set Ready (DDSR). Bit 1 indicates that the nDSR input has changed state since the last time the MSR was
read.
RI
Trailing Edge of Ring Indicator (TERI). Bit 2 indicates that the nRI input has changed from logic “0” to logic “1”.
DCD
Delta Data Carrier Detect (DDCD). Bit 3 indicates that the nDCD input to the chip has changed state.
   Note 9-11      Whenever bit 0, 1, 2, or 3 is set to a logic “1”, a MODEM Status Interrupt is generated.
CTS
This bit is the complement of the Clear To Send (nCTS) input. If bit 4 of the MCR is set to logic “1”, this bit is equivalent
to nRTS in the MCR.
DSR
This bit is the complement of the Data Set Ready (nDSR) input. If bit 4 of the MCR is set to logic “1”, this bit is equivalent
to DTR in the MCR.
RI#
This bit is the complement of the Ring Indicator (nRI) input. If bit 4 of the MCR is set to logic “1”, this bit is equivalent to
OUT1 in the MCR.
DCD
This bit is the complement of the Data Carrier Detect (nDCD) input. If bit 4 of the MCR is set to logic “1”, this bit is equiv-
alent to OUT2 in the MCR.

Baud_Rate_Divisor
The Serial Port contains a programmable Baud Rate Generator that is capable of dividing the internal clock source by
any divisor from 1 to 65535. The clock source is either a 1.8432MHz clock derived from the 64.52MHz ring oscillator or
a 32.26Mhz clock also derived from the ring oscillator. The output frequency of the Baud Rate Generator is 16x the Baud
rate. Two eight bit latches store the divisor in 16 bit binary format. These Divisor Latches must be loaded during initial-
ization in order to insure desired operation of the Baud Rate Generator. Upon loading either of the Divisor Latches, a
16 bit Baud counter is immediately loaded. This prevents long counts on initial load. If a 0 is loaded into the BRG reg-
isters, the output divides the clock by the number 3. If a 1 is loaded, the output is the inverse of the input oscillator. If a
two is loaded, the output is a divide by 2 signal with a 50% duty cycle. If a 3 or greater is loaded, the output is low for 2
bits and high for the remainder of the count.
Table 9-20 and Table 9-21 shows the baud rates possible.

When this bit is 1, the UART logical device is powered and functional. When this bit is 0, the UART logical device is
powered down and inactive.
    Note 9-12   If the Power bit in the Configuration Select register is 1, then the Activate register is reset on
                nSIO_RESET. If the Power bit is 0, then the Activate register is reset on nSYS_RST.

CLK_SRC
When this bit is 0, the UART clock is derived from the internal ring oscillator. When this bit is 1, the UART clock is derived
from an external clock source
POWER
When this bit is 1, the UART Runtime Registers (the registers at offsets 0h through 7h from the base of the UART Logical
Device) are controlled by VCC. They are set to their POR defaults on a nSIO_RESET.
When this bit is 0, the UART Runtime Registers are controlled by VTR. They are set to their POR defaults on an nSYS-
_RST.
POLARITY
When the Polarity bit is asserted (‘1’), the UART_TX and UART_RX pins functions are inverted. When the Polarity bit
is not asserted (default), the UART_TX and UART_RX pins functions are not inverted.

SCH5627P
10.0       PARALLEL PORT
The SCH5627P incorporates an IBM XT/AT compatible parallel port. This supports the optional PS/2 type bi-directional
parallel port (SPP), the Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) and the Extended Capabilities Port (ECP) parallel port modes.
Refer to the Configuration Registers for information on disabling, power- down, changing the base address of the par-
allel port, and selecting the mode of operation.
The parallel port also incorporates Microchip’s ChiProtect circuitry, which prevents possible damage to the parallel port
due to printer power-up.
The functionality of the Parallel Port is achieved through the use of eight addressable ports, with their associated reg-
isters and control gating. The control and data port are read/write by the CPU, the status port is read/write in the EPP
mode. The address map of the Parallel Port is shown below:

10.1       IBM XT/AT Compatible, Bi-Directional and EPP Modes
10.1.1        DATA PORT
ADDRESS OFFSET = 00H
The Data Port is located at an offset of ‘00H’ from the base address. The data register is cleared at initialization by
RESET. During a WRITE operation, the Data Register latches the contents of the internal data bus. The contents of this
register are buffered (non inverting) and output onto the PD0 - PD7 ports. During a READ operation in SPP mode, PD0
- PD7 ports are buffered (not latched) and output to the host CPU.
10.1.2        STATUS PORT
ADDRESS OFFSET = 01H
The Status Port is located at an offset of ‘01H’ from the base address. The contents of this register are latched for the
duration of a read cycle. The bits of the Status Port are defined as follows:
Bit 0 TMOUT - TIME OUT
This bit is valid in EPP mode only and indicates that a 10 msec time out has occurred on the EPP bus. A logic O means
that no time out error has occurred; a logic 1 means that a time out error has been detected. This bit is cleared by a
RESET. If the TIMEOUT_SELECT bit (bit 4 of the Parallel Port Mode Register 2, 0xF1 in Logical Device 3 Configuration
Registers) is ‘0’, writing a one to this bit clears the TMOUT status bit. Writing a zero to this bit has no effect. If the TIM-
EOUT_SELECT bit (bit 4 of the Parallel Port Mode Register 2, 0xF1 in Logical Device 3 Configuration Registers) is ‘1’,
the TMOUT bit is cleared on the trailing edge of a read of the EPP Status Register.
Bits 1, 2 - are not implemented as register bits, during a read of the Printer Status Register these bits are a low level.
Bit 3 nERR – ERROR#
The level on the ERROR# input is read by the CPU as bit 3 of the Printer Status Register. A logic 0 means an error has
been detected; a logic 1 means no error has been detected.
Bit 4 SLT - Printer Selected Status
The level on the SLCT input is read by the CPU as bit 4 of the Printer Status Register. A logic 1 means the printer is on
line; a logic 0 means it is not selected.
Bit 5 PE - Paper End
The level on the PE input is read by the CPU as bit 5 of the Printer Status Register. A logic 1 indicates a paper end; a
logic 0 indicates the presence of paper.
Bit 6 ACK# - Acknowledge
The level on the ACK# input is read by the CPU as bit 6 of the Printer Status Register. A logic 0 means that the printer
has received a character and can now accept another. A logic 1 means that it is still processing the last character or has
not received the data.
Bit 7 nBUSY - nBUSY
The complement of the level on the BUSY input is read by the CPU as bit 7 of the Printer Status Register. A logic 0 in
this bit means that the printer is busy and cannot accept a new character. A logic 1 means that it is ready to accept the
next character.

SCH5627P
10.1.3         CONTROL PORT
ADDRESS OFFSET = 02H
The Control Port is located at an offset of ‘02H’ from the base address. The Control Register is initialized by the RESET
input, bits 0 to 5 only being affected; bits 6 and 7 are hard wired low.
Bit 0 STROBE - Strobe
This bit is inverted and output onto the STROBE# output.
Bit 1 AUTOFD - Autofeed
This bit is inverted and output onto the nAutoFd output. A logic 1 causes the printer to generate a line feed after each
line is printed. A logic 0 means no autofeed.
Bit 2 INIT# - Initiate Output
This bit is output onto the INIT# output without inversion.
Bit 3 SLCTIN - Printer Select Input
This bit is inverted and output onto the SLCTIN# output. A logic 1 on this bit selects the printer; a logic 0 means the
printer is not selected.
Bit 4 IRQE - Interrupt Request Enable
The interrupt request enable bit when set to a high level may be used to enable interrupt requests from the Parallel Port
to the CPU. An interrupt request is generated on the IRQ port by a positive going ACK# input. When the IRQE bit is
programmed low the IRQ is disabled.
Bit 5 PCD - PARALLEL CONTROL DIRECTION
Parallel Control Direction is not valid in printer mode. In printer mode, the direction is always out regardless of the state
of this bit. In bi-directional, EPP or ECP mode, a logic 0 means that the printer port is in output mode (write); a logic 1
means that the printer port is in input mode (read).
Bits 6 and 7 during a read are a low level, and cannot be written.
10.1.4         EPP ADDRESS PORT
ADDRESS OFFSET = 03H
The EPP Address Port is located at an offset of ‘03H’ from the base address. The address register is cleared at initial-
ization by RESET. During a WRITE operation, the contents of the internal data bus DB0-DB7 are buffered (non inverting)
and output onto the PD0 - PD7 ports. An LPC I/O write cycle causes an EPP ADDRESS WRITE cycle to be performed,
during which the data is latched for the duration of the EPP write cycle. During a READ operation, PD0 - PD7 ports are
read. An LPC I/O read cycle causes an EPP ADDRESS READ cycle to be performed and the data output to the host
CPU, the deassertion of ADDRSTB latches the PData for the duration of the read cycle. This register is only available
in EPP mode.
10.1.5         EPP DATA PORT 0
ADDRESS OFFSET = 04H
The EPP Data Port 0 is located at an offset of ‘04H’ from the base address. The data register is cleared at initialization
by RESET. During a WRITE operation, the contents of the internal data bus DB0-DB7 are buffered (non inverting) and
output onto the PD0 - PD7 ports. An LPC I/O write cycle causes an EPP DATA WRITE cycle to be performed, during
which the data is latched for the duration of the EPP write cycle. During a READ operation, PD0 - PD7 ports are read.
An LPC I/O read cycle causes an EPP READ cycle to be performed and the data output to the host CPU, the deassertion

The EPP Data Port 3 is located at an offset of ‘07H’ from the base address. Refer to EPP DATA PORT 0 for a description
of operation. This register is only available in EPP mode.
10.1.9        EPP 1.9 OPERATION
bit When the EPP mode is selected in the configuration register, the standard and bi-directional modes are also avail-
able. If no EPP Read, Write or Address cycle is currently executing, then the PDx bus is in the standard or bi-directional
mode, and all output signals (STROBE, AUTOFD, INIT) are as set by the SPP Control Port and direction is controlled
by PCD of the Control port.
bit In EPP mode, the system timing is closely coupled to the EPP timing. For this reason, a watchdog timer is required
to prevent system lockup. The timer indicates if more than 10usec have elapsed from the start of the EPP cycle to nWAIT
being deasserted (after command). If a time-out occurs, the current EPP cycle is aborted and the time-out condition is
indicated in Status bit 0.
bit During an EPP cycle, if STROBE is active, it overrides the EPP write signal forcing the PDx bus to always be in a
write mode and the nWRITE signal to always be asserted.
10.1.10       SOFTWARE CONSTRAINTS
Before an EPP cycle is executed, the software must ensure that the control register bit PCD is a logic “0” (i.e., a 04H or
05H should be written to the Control port). If the user leaves PCD as a logic “1”, and attempts to perform an EPP write,
the chip is unable to perform the write (because PCD is a logic “1”) and will appear to perform an EPP read on the par-
allel bus, no error is indicated.
10.1.11       EPP 1.9 WRITE
The timing for a write operation (address or data) is shown in timing diagram EPP Write Data or Address cycle. The chip
inserts wait states into the LPC I/O write cycle until it has been determined that the write cycle can complete. The write
cycle can complete under the following circumstances:
• If the EPP bus is not ready (nWAIT is active low) when nDATASTB or nADDRSTB goes active then the write can
   complete when nWAIT goes inactive high.
• If the EPP bus is ready (nWAIT is inactive high) then the chip must wait for it to go active low before changing the
   state of nDATASTB, nWRITE or nADDRSTB. The write can complete once nWAIT is determined inactive.
Write Sequence of Operation
1.    The host initiates an I/O write cycle to the selected EPP register.
2.    If WAIT is not asserted, the chip must wait until WAIT is asserted.
3.    The chip places address or data on PData bus, clears PDIR, and asserts nWRITE.
4.    Chip asserts nDATASTB or nADDRSTRB indicating that PData bus contains valid information, and the WRITE
      signal is valid.
5.    Peripheral deasserts nWAIT, indicating that any setup requirements have been satisfied and the chip may begin
      the termination phase of the cycle.
6.
a)    The chip deasserts nDATASTB or nADDRSTRB, this marks the beginning of the termination phase. If it has not
      already done so, the peripheral should latch the information byte now.
b)    The chip latches the data from the internal data bus for the PData bus and drives the sync that indicates that no
      more wait states are required followed by the TAR to complete the write cycle.
7.    Peripheral asserts nWAIT, indicating to the host that any hold time requirements have been satisfied and
      acknowledging the termination of the cycle.
8.    Chip may modify nWRITE and nPDATA in preparation for the next cycle.

10.1.12       EPP 1.9 READ
The timing for a read operation (data) is shown in timing diagram EPP Read Data cycle. The chip inserts wait states into
the LPC I/O read cycle until it has been determined that the read cycle can complete. The read cycle can complete under
the following circumstances:
• If the EPP bus is not ready (nWAIT is active low) when nDATASTB goes active then the read can complete when
   nWAIT goes inactive high.
• If the EPP bus is ready (nWAIT is inactive high) then the chip must wait for it to go active low before changing the
   state of nWRITE or before nDATASTB goes active. The read can complete once nWAIT is determined inactive.
Read Sequence of Operation
1.    The host initiates an I/O read cycle to the selected EPP register.
2.    If WAIT is not asserted, the chip must wait until WAIT is asserted.
3.    The chip tri-states the PData bus and deasserts nWRITE.
4.    Chip asserts nDATASTB or nADDRSTRB indicating that PData bus is tri-stated, PDIR is set and the nWRITE
      signal is valid.
5. Peripheral drives PData bus valid.
6. Peripheral deasserts nWAIT, indicating that PData is valid and the chip may begin the termination phase of the
      cycle.
7. The chip latches the data from the PData bus for the internal data bus and deasserts nDATASTB or nAD-
      DRSTRB. This marks the beginning of the termination phase.
8. The chip drives the sync that indicates that no more wait states are required and drives valid data onto the
      LAD[3:0] signals, followed by the TAR to complete the read cycle.
9. Peripheral tri-states the PData bus and asserts nWAIT, indicating to the host that the PData bus is tri-stated.
10. Chip may modify nWRITE, PDIR and nPDATA in preparation for the next cycle.
10.1.13       EPP 1.7 OPERATION
When the EPP 1.7 mode is selected in the configuration register, the standard and bi-directional modes are also avail-
able. If no EPP Read, Write or Address cycle is currently executing, then the PDx bus is in the standard or bi-directional
mode, and all output signals (STROBE, AUTOFD, INIT) are as set by the SPP Control Port and direction is controlled

of the cycle. If a time-out occurs, the current EPP cycle is aborted and the time-out condition is indicated in Status bit 0.
10.1.14       SOFTWARE CONSTRAINTS
Before an EPP cycle is executed, the software must ensure that the control register bits D0, D1 and D3 are set to zero.
Also, bit D5 (PCD) is a logic “0” for an EPP write or a logic “1” for and EPP read.
10.1.15       EPP 1.7 WRITE
The timing for a write operation (address or data) is shown in timing diagram EPP 1.7 Write Data or Address cycle. The
chip inserts wait states into the I/O write cycle when nWAIT is active low during the EPP cycle. This can be used to
extend the cycle time. The write cycle can complete when nWAIT is inactive high.
Write Sequence of Operation
•  The host sets PDIR bit in the control register to a logic “0”. This asserts nWRITE.
•  The host initiates an I/O write cycle to the selected EPP register.
•  The chip places address or data on PData bus.
•  Chip asserts nDATASTB or nADDRSTRB indicating that PData bus contains valid information, and the WRITE
   signal is valid.
• If nWAIT is asserted, the chip inserts wait states into I/O write cycle until the peripheral deasserts nWAIT or a time-
   out occurs.
• The chip drives the final sync, deasserts nDATASTB or nADDRSTRB and latches the data from the internal data
   bus for the PData bus.
• Chip may modify nWRITE, PDIR and nPDATA in preparation of the next cycle.

10.2.2       ECP IMPLEMENTATION STANDARD
This specification describes the standard interface to the Extended Capabilities Port (ECP). All LPC devices supporting
ECP must meet the requirements contained in this section or the port will not be supported by Microsoft. For a descrip-
tion of the ECP Protocol, please refer to the IEEE 1284 Extended Capabilities Port Protocol and ISA Interface Standard,
Rev. 1.14, July 14, 1993. This document is available from Microsoft.
Description
The port is software and hardware compatible with existing parallel ports so that it may be used as a standard LPT port
if ECP is not required. The port is designed to be simple and requires a small number of gates to implement. It does not
do any “protocol” negotiation, rather it provides an automatic high burst-bandwidth channel that supports DMA for ECP
in both the forward and reverse directions.
Small FIFOs are employed in both forward and reverse directions to smooth data flow and improve the maximum band-
width requirement. The size of the FIFO is 16 bytes deep. The port supports an automatic handshake for the standard
parallel port to improve compatibility mode transfer speed.
The port also supports run length encoded (RLE) decompression (required) in hardware. Compression is accomplished
by counting identical bytes and transmitting an RLE byte that indicates how many times the next byte is to be repeated.
Decompression simply intercepts the RLE byte and repeats the following byte the specified number of times. Hardware
support for compression is optional.

 PeriphAck (Busy)         I            This signal deasserts to indicate that the peripheral can accept data. This signal
                                       handshakes with STROBE# in the forward direction. In the reverse direction this
                                       signal indicates whether the data lines contain ECP command information or
                                       data. The peripheral uses this signal to flow control in the forward direction. It
                                       is an “interlocked” handshake with STROBE#. PeriphAck also provides
                                       command information in the reverse direction.
 PError                   I            Used to acknowledge a change in the direction the transfer (asserted =
 (ACK#Reverse)                         forward). The peripheral drives this signal low to acknowledge
                                       nReverseRequest. It is an “interlocked” handshake with nReverseRequest. The
                                       host relies upon ACK#Reverse to determine when it is permitted to drive the
                                       data bus.
 Select                   I            Indicates printer on line.
 nAutoFd                  O            Requests a byte of data from the peripheral when asserted, handshaking with
 (HostAck)                             ACK# in the reverse direction. In the forward direction this signal indicates
                                       whether the data lines contain ECP address or data. The host drives this signal
                                       to flow control in the reverse direction. It is an “interlocked” handshake with
                                       ACK#. HostAck also provides command information in the forward phase.
 nFault                   I            Generates an error interrupt when asserted. This signal provides a mechanism
 (nPeriphRequest)                      for peer-to-peer communication. This signal is valid only in the forward direction.
                                       During ECP Mode the peripheral is permitted (but not required) to drive this pin
                                       low to request a reverse transfer. The request is merely a “hint” to the host; the
                                       host has ultimate control over the transfer direction. This signal would be
                                       typically used to generate an interrupt to the host CPU.
 INIT#                    O            Sets the transfer direction (asserted = reverse, deasserted = forward). This pin
                                       is driven low to place the channel in the reverse direction. The peripheral is only
                                       allowed to drive the bidirectional data bus while in ECP Mode and HostAck is
                                       low and nSelectIn is high.

10.2.3       REGISTER DEFINITIONS
The register definitions are based on the standard IBM addresses for LPT. All of the standard printer ports are supported.
The additional registers attach to an upper bit decode of the standard LPT port definition to avoid conflict with standard
ISA devices. The port is equivalent to a generic parallel port interface and may be operated in that mode. The port reg-
isters vary depending on the mode field in the ecr. Table 10-6 lists these dependencies. Operation of the devices in
modes other that those specified is undefined.

10.2.4       DATA AND ECPAFIFO PORT
ADDRESS OFFSET = 00H
Modes 000 and 001 (Data Port)
The Data Port is located at an offset of ‘00H’ from the base address. The data register is cleared at initialization by
RESET. During a WRITE operation, the Data Register latches the contents of the data bus. The contents of this register
are buffered (non inverting) and output onto the PD0 - PD7 ports. During a READ operation, PD0 - PD7 ports are read
and output to the host CPU.
Mode 011 (ECP FIFO - Address/RLE)
A data byte written to this address is placed in the FIFO and tagged as an ECP Address/RLE. The hardware at the ECP
port transmits this byte to the peripheral automatically. The operation of this register is only defined for the forward direc-
tion (direction is 0). Refer to TABLE 22-12: on page 218, located in Section 22.0, "Timing Diagrams," on page 208 of
this data sheet.

10.2.5        DEVICE STATUS REGISTER (DSR)
ADDRESS OFFSET = 01H
The Status Port is located at an offset of ‘01H’ from the base address. Bits0 - 2 are not implemented as register bits,
during a read of the Printer Status Register these bits are a low level. The bits of the Status Port are defined as follows:
Bit 3 nFault
The level on the nFault input is read by the CPU as bit 3 of the Device Status Register.
Bit 4 Select
The level on the Select input is read by the CPU as bit 4 of the Device Status Register.
Bit 5 PError
The level on the PError input is read by the CPU as bit 5 of the Device Status Register. Printer Status Register.
Bit 6 ACK#
The level on the ACK# input is read by the CPU as bit 6 of the Device Status Register.
Bit 7 nBusy
The complement of the level on the BUSY input is read by the CPU as bit 7 of the Device Status Register.
10.2.6        DEVICE CONTROL REGISTER (DCR)
ADDRESS OFFSET = 02H
The Control Register is located at an offset of ‘02H’ from the base address. The Control Register is only valid after acti-
vation and is initialized to zero by the RESET input, bits 0 to 5 only being affected; bits 6 and 7 are hard wired low.
Bit 0 STROBE - STROBE
This bit is inverted and output onto the STROBE# output.
Bit 1 AUTOFD - AUTOFEED
This bit is inverted and output onto the nAutoFd output. A logic 1 causes the printer to generate a line feed after each
line is printed. A logic 0 means no autofeed.
Bit 2 INIT# - INITIATE OUTPUT
This bit is output onto the INIT# output without inversion.
Bit 3 SELECTIN
This bit is inverted and output onto the SLCTIN# output. A logic 1 on this bit selects the printer; a logic 0 means the
printer is not selected.
Bit 4 ackIntEn - INTERRUPT REQUEST ENABLE
The interrupt request enable bit when set to a high level may be used to enable interrupt requests from the Parallel
Port to the CPU due to a low to high transition on the ACK# input. Refer to the description of the interrupt under Oper-
ation, Interrupts.
Bit 5 DIRECTION
If mode=000 or mode=010, this bit has no effect and the direction is always out regardless of the state of this bit. In all
other modes, Direction is valid and a logic 0 means that the printer port is in output mode (write); a logic 1 means that
the printer port is in input mode (read).
Bits 6 and 7 during a read are a low level, and cannot be written.
cFifo (Parallel Port Data FIFO)
ADDRESS OFFSET = 400h
Mode = 010
Bytes written or DMAed from the system to this FIFO are transmitted by a hardware handshake to the peripheral using
the standard parallel port protocol. Transfers to the FIFO are byte aligned. This mode is only defined for the forward
direction.

SCH5627P
Bytes written or DMAed from the system to this FIFO, when the direction bit is 0, are transmitted by a hardware hand-
shake to the peripheral using the ECP parallel port protocol. Transfers to the FIFO are byte aligned.
Data bytes from the peripheral are read under automatic hardware handshake from ECP into this FIFO when the direc-
tion bit is 1. Reads or DMAs from the FIFO will return bytes of ECP data to the system.
tFifo (Test FIFO Mode)
ADDRESS OFFSET = 400H
Mode = 110
Data bytes may be read, written or DMAed to or from the system to this FIFO in any direction. Data in the tFIFO will not
be transmitted to the to the parallel port lines using a hardware protocol handshake. However, data in the tFIFO may be
displayed on the parallel port data lines.
The tFIFO will not stall when overwritten or underrun. If an attempt is made to write data to a full tFIFO, the new data is
not accepted into the tFIFO. If an attempt is made to read data from an empty tFIFO, the last data byte is re-read again.
The full and empty bits must always keep track of the correct FIFO state. The tFIFO will transfer data at the maximum
ISA rate so that software may generate performance metrics.
The FIFO size and interrupt threshold can be determined by writing bytes to the FIFO and checking the full and servi-
ceIntr bits.
The writeIntrThreshold can be determined by starting with a full tFIFO, setting the direction bit to 0 and emptying it a
byte at a time until serviceIntr is set. This may generate a spurious interrupt, but will indicate that the threshold has been
reached.
The readIntrThreshold can be determined by setting the direction bit to 1 and filling the empty tFIFO a byte at a time
until serviceIntr is set. This may generate a spurious interrupt, but will indicate that the threshold has been reached.
Data bytes are always read from the head of tFIFO regardless of the value of the direction bit. For example if 44h, 33h,
22h is written to the FIFO, then reading the tFIFO will return 44h, 33h, 22h in the same order as was written.
cnfgA (Configuration Register A)
ADDRESS OFFSET = 400H
Mode = 111
This register is a read only register. When read, 10H is returned. This indicates to the system that this is an 8-bit imple-
mentation. (PWord = 1 byte)
cnfgB (Configuration Register B)
ADDRESS OFFSET = 401H
Mode = 111
Bit 7 compress
This bit is read only. During a read it is a low level. This means that this chip does not support hardware RLE compres-
sion. It does support hardware de-compression.
Bit 6 intrValue
Returns the value of the interrupt to determine possible conflicts.

Read/Write (Valid only in ECP Mode)
1:     Disables the interrupt generated on the asserting edge of nFault.
0:     Enables an interrupt pulse on the high to low edge of nFault. Note that an interrupt will be generated if nFault is
       asserted (interrupting) and this bit is written from a 1 to a 0. This prevents interrupts from being lost in the time
       between the read of the ecr and the write of the ecr.

1:     Enables DMA (DMA starts when serviceIntr is 0).
0:     Disables DMA unconditionally.
Bit 2 serviceIntr
Read/Write
1:      Disables DMA and all of the service interrupts.
0:      Enables one of the following 3 cases of interrupts. Once one of the 3 service interrupts has occurred serviceIntr
       bit shall be set to a 1 by hardware. It must be reset to 0 to re-enable the interrupts. Writing this bit to a 1 will not
       cause an interrupt.

During DMA (this bit is set to a 1 when terminal count is reached).
case dmaEn=0 direction=0:
This bit shall be set to 1 whenever there are writeIntrThreshold or more bytes free in the FIFO.
case dmaEn=0 direction=1:
This bit shall be set to 1 whenever there are readIntrThreshold or more valid bytes to be read from the FIFO.
Bit 1 full
Read only
1:     The FIFO cannot accept another byte or the FIFO is completely full.
0:     The FIFO has at least 1 free byte.

10.2.7        OPERATION
Mode Switching/Software Control
Software will execute P1284 negotiation and all operation prior to a data transfer phase under programmed I/O control
(mode 000 or 001). Hardware provides an automatic control line handshake, moving data between the FIFO and the
ECP port only in the data transfer phase (modes 011 or 010).
Setting the mode to 011 or 010 will cause the hardware to initiate data transfer.
If the port is in mode 000 or 001 it may switch to any other mode. If the port is not in mode 000 or 001 it can only be
switched into mode 000 or 001. The direction can only be changed in mode 001.

Once in an extended forward mode the software should wait for the FIFO to be empty before switching back to mode
000 or 001. In this case all control signals will be deasserted before the mode switch. In an ecp reverse mode the soft-
ware waits for all the data to be read from the FIFO before changing back to mode 000 or 001. Since the automatic
hardware ecp reverse handshake only cares about the state of the FIFO it may have acquired extra data which will be
discarded. It may in fact be in the middle of a transfer when the mode is changed back to 000 or 001. In this case the
port will deassert nAutoFd independent of the state of the transfer. The design shall not cause glitches on the handshake
signals if the software meets the constraints above.

Prior to ECP operation the Host must negotiate on the parallel port to determine if the peripheral supports the ECP
protocol. This is a somewhat complex negotiation carried out under program control in mode 000.
After negotiation, it is necessary to initialize some of the port bits. The following are required:
Set Direction = 0, enabling the drivers.
Set strobe     = 0, causing the STROBE# signal to default to the deasserted state.
Set autoFd     = 0, causing the nAutoFd signal to default to the deasserted state.
Set mode       = 011 (ECP Mode)
ECP address/RLE bytes or data bytes may be sent automatically by writing the ecpAFifo or ecpDFifo respectively.
Note all FIFO data transfers are byte wide and byte aligned. Address/RLE transfers are byte-wide and only allowed in
the forward direction.
The host may switch directions by first switching to mode = 001, negotiating for the forward or reverse channel, setting
direction to 1 or 0, then setting mode = 011. When direction is 1 the hardware shall handshake for each ECP read data
byte and attempt to fill the FIFO. Bytes may then be read from the ecpDFifo as long as it is not empty.
ECP transfers may also be accomplished (albeit slowly) by handshaking individual bytes under program control in mode
= 001, or 000.
10.2.8       TERMINATION FROM ECP MODE
Termination from ECP Mode is similar to the termination from Nibble/Byte Modes. The host is permitted to terminate
from ECP Mode only in specific well-defined states. The termination can only be executed while the bus is in the forward
direction. To terminate while the channel is in the reverse direction, it must first be transitioned into the forward direction.
10.2.9       COMMAND/DATA
ECP Mode supports two advanced features to improve the effectiveness of the protocol for some applications. The fea-
tures are implemented by allowing the transfer of normal 8 bit data or 8 bit commands.
When in the forward direction, normal data is transferred when HostAck is high and an 8 bit command is transferred
when HostAck is low.
The most significant bit of the command indicates whether it is a run-length count (for compression) or a channel
address.
When in the reverse direction, normal data is transferred when PeriphAck is high and an 8 bit command is transferred
when PeriphAck is low. The most significant bit of the command is always zero. Reverse channel addresses are seldom
used and may not be supported in hardware.

10.2.10       DATA COMPRESSION
The ECP port supports run length encoded (RLE) decompression in hardware and can transfer compressed data to a
peripheral. Run length encoded (RLE) compression in hardware is not supported. To transfer compressed data in ECP
mode, the compression count is written to the ecpAFifo and the data byte is written to the ecpDFifo.
Compression is accomplished by counting identical bytes and transmitting an RLE byte that indicates how many times
the next byte is to be repeated. Decompression simply intercepts the RLE byte and repeats the following byte the spec-
ified number of times. When a run-length count is received from a peripheral, the subsequent data byte is replicated the
specified number of times. A run-length count of zero specifies that only one byte of data is represented by the next data
byte, whereas a run-length count of 127 indicates that the next byte should be expanded to 128 bytes. To prevent data
expansion, however, run-length counts of zero should be avoided.
10.2.11       PIN DEFINITION
The drivers for STROBE#, nAutoFd, INIT# and nSelectIn are open-drain in mode 000 and are push-pull in all other
modes.
10.2.12       LPC CONNECTIONS
The interface can never stall causing the host to hang. The width of data transfers is strictly controlled on an I/O address
basis per this specification. All FIFO-DMA transfers are byte wide, byte aligned and end on a byte boundary. (The PWord
value can be obtained by reading Configuration Register A, cnfgA, described in the next section). Single byte wide
transfers are always possible with standard or PS/2 mode using program control of the control signals.
10.2.13       INTERRUPTS
The interrupts are enabled by serviceIntr in the ecr register.
serviceIntr = 1 Disables the DMA and all of the service interrupts.
serviceIntr = 0 Enables the selected interrupt condition. If the interrupting condition is valid, then the interrupts gen-
                  erated immediately when this bit is changed from a 1 to a 0. This can occur during Programmed I/O if
                  the number of bytes removed or added from/to the FIFO does not cross the threshold.
An interrupt is generated when:
1.    For DMA transfers: When serviceIntr is 0, dmaEn is 1 and the DMA TC cycle is received.
2.    For Programmed I/O:
3.    When serviceIntr is 0, dmaEn is 0, direction is 0 and there are writeIntrThreshold or more free bytes in the FIFO.
      Also, an interrupt is generated when serviceIntr is cleared to 0 whenever there are writeIntrThreshold or more
      free bytes in the FIFO.
4.    When serviceIntr is 0, dmaEn is 0, direction is 1 and there are readIntrThreshold or more bytes in the FIFO. Also,
      an interrupt is generated when serviceIntr is cleared to 0 whenever there are readIntrThreshold or more bytes in
      the FIFO.
5.    When nErrIntrEn is 0 and nFault transitions from high to low or when nErrIntrEn is set from 1 to 0 and nFault is
      asserted.
6.    When ackIntEn is 1 and the ACK# signal transitions from a low to a high.
10.2.14       FIFO OPERATION
The FIFO threshold is set in the chip configuration registers. All data transfers to or from the parallel port can proceed
in DMA or Programmed I/O (non-DMA) mode as indicated by the selected mode. The FIFO is used by selecting the
Parallel Port FIFO mode or ECP Parallel Port Mode. (FIFO test mode will be addressed separately.) After a reset, the
FIFO is disabled. Each data byte is transferred by a Programmed I/O cycle or DMA cycle depending on the selection of
DMA or Programmed I/O mode.
The following paragraphs detail the operation of the FIFO flow control. In these descriptions, <threshold> ranges from
1 to 16. The parameter FIFOTHR, which the user programs, is one less and ranges from 0 to 15.
A low threshold value (i.e. 2) results in longer periods of time between service requests, but requires faster servicing of
the request for both read and write cases. The host must be very responsive to the service request. This is the desired
case for use with a “fast” system. A high value of threshold (i.e. 12) is used with a “sluggish” system by affording a long
latency period after a service request, but results in more frequent service requests.

10.2.15       DMA TRANSFERS
DMA transfers are always to or from the ecpDFifo, tFifo or CFifo. DMA utilizes the standard PC DMA services. To use
the DMA transfers, the host first sets up the direction and state as in the programmed I/O case. Then it programs the
DMA controller in the host with the desired count and memory address. Lastly it sets dmaEn to 1 and serviceIntr to 0.
The ECP requests DMA transfers from the host by encoding the LDRQ# pin. The DMA will empty or fill the FIFO using
the appropriate direction and mode. When the terminal count in the DMA controller is reached, an interrupt is generated
and serviceIntr is asserted, disabling DMA. In order to prevent possible blocking of refresh requests a DMA cycle shall
not be requested for more than 32 DMA cycles in a row. The FIFO is enabled directly by the host initiating a DMA cycle
for the requested channel, and addresses need not be valid. An interrupt is generated when a TC cycle is received.
(Note: The only way to properly terminate DMA transfers is with a TC cycle.)
DMA may be disabled in the middle of a transfer by first disabling the host DMA controller. Then setting serviceIntr to
1, followed by setting dmaEn to 0, and waiting for the FIFO to become empty or full. Restarting the DMA is accomplished
by enabling DMA in the host, setting dmaEn to 1, followed by setting serviceIntr to 0.
10.2.16       DMA MODE - TRANSFERS FROM THE FIFO TO THE HOST
In the reverse mode, the peripheral may not continue to fill the FIFO if it runs out of data to transfer, even if the chip
continues to request more data from the peripheral.)
The ECP requests a DMA cycle whenever there is data in the FIFO. The DMA controller must respond to the request
by reading data from the FIFO. The ECP stops requesting DMA cycles when the FIFO becomes empty or when a TC
cycle is received, indicating that no more data is required. If the ECP stops requesting DMA cycles due to the FIFO
going empty, then a DMA cycle is requested again as soon as there is one byte in the FIFO. If the ECP stops requesting
DMA cycles due to the TC cycle, then a DMA cycle is requested again when there is one byte in the FIFO, and servi-
ceIntr has been re-enabled.
10.2.17       PROGRAMMED I/O MODE OR NON-DMA MODE
The ECP or parallel port FIFOs may also be operated using interrupt driven programmed I/O. Software can determine
the writeIntrThreshold, readIntrThreshold, and FIFO depth by accessing the FIFO in Test Mode.
Programmed I/O transfers are to the ecpDFifo at 400H and ecpAFifo at 000H or from the ecpDFifo located at 400H, or
to/from the tFifo at 400H. To use the programmed I/O transfers, the host first sets up the direction and state, sets dmaEn
to 0 and serviceIntr to 0.
The ECP requests programmed I/O transfers from the host by activating the interrupt. The programmed I/O will empty
or fill the FIFO using the appropriate direction and mode.
   Note 10-11     A threshold of 16 is equivalent to a threshold of 15. These two cases are treated the same.
10.2.18       PROGRAMMED I/O - TRANSFERS FROM THE FIFO TO THE HOST
In the reverse direction an interrupt occurs when serviceIntr is 0 and readIntrThreshold bytes are available in the FIFO.
If at this time the FIFO is full it can be emptied completely in a single burst, otherwise readIntrThreshold bytes may be
read from the FIFO in a single burst.
readIntrThreshold =(16-<threshold>) data bytes in FIFO
An interrupt is generated when serviceIntr is 0 and the number of bytes in the FIFO is greater than or equal to (16-
<threshold>). (If the threshold = 12, then the interrupt is set whenever there are 4-16 bytes in the FIFO). The host must
respond to the request by reading data from the FIFO. This process is repeated until the last byte is transferred out of
the FIFO. If at this time the FIFO is full, it can be completely emptied in a single burst, otherwise a minimum of (16-
<threshold>) bytes may be read from the FIFO in a single burst.
10.2.19       PROGRAMMED I/O - TRANSFERS FROM THE HOST TO THE FIFO
In the forward direction an interrupt occurs when serviceIntr is 0 and there are writeIntrThreshold or more bytes free in
the FIFO. At this time if the FIFO is empty it can be filled with a single burst before the empty bit needs to be re-read.
Otherwise it may be filled with writeIntrThreshold bytes.
writeIntrThreshold = (16-<threshold>) free bytes in FIFO
An interrupt is generated when serviceIntr is 0 and the number of bytes in the FIFO is less than or equal to <threshold>.
(If the threshold = 12, then the interrupt is set whenever there are 12 or less bytes of data in the FIFO.) The host must
respond to the request by writing data to the FIFO. If at this time the FIFO is empty, it can be completely filled in a single
burst, otherwise a minimum of (16-<threshold>) bytes may be written to the FIFO in a single burst. This process is
repeated until the last byte is transferred into the FIFO.

11.0        FLOPPY DISK CONTROLLER
The Floppy Disk controller (FDC) provides the interface between a host microprocessor and the floppy disk drives. The
FDC integrates the functions of the Formatter/Controller, Digital data Separator, Write Precompensation and Data Rate
Selection logic for an IBM XT/AT compatible FDC. The true CMOS 765B core maintains 100% IBM PC XT/AT compat-
ibility in addition to providing data overflow and underflow protection. SCH5627P supports one floppy drive directly (see
Section 11.12, "Floppy Drive Presence Detection," on page 133).
The FDC is compatible to the 82077AA using Microchip’s proprietary floppy disk controller core.
   Note:      Although the SCH5627P supports only a single floppy drive, references to the second drive are retained in
              this chapter for reference.
11.1        FDC Internal Registers
The Floppy Disk Controller contains eight internal registers which facilitate the interfacing between the host micropro-
cessor and the disk drive. Table 11-1 shows the addresses required to access these registers. Registers other than the
ones shown are not supported. The rest of the description assumes that the primary addresses have been selected.

Bit 0 and 1 DRIVE SELECT
These two bits are binary encoded for the drive selects, thereby allowing only one drive to be selected at one time. Note:
Only one drive is supported.
Bit 2 nRESET
A logic “0” written to this bit resets the Floppy disk controller. This reset will remain active until a logic “1” is written to
this bit. This software reset does not affect the DSR and CCR registers, nor does it affect the other bits of the DOR reg-
ister. The minimum reset duration required is 100ns, toggling this bit by consecutive writes to this register is a valid
method of issuing a software reset.
Bit 3 DMAEN
PC/AT and Model 30 Mode:
Writing this bit to logic “1” will enable the DMA and interrupt functions. This bit being a logic “0” will disable the DMA and
interrupt functions. This bit is a logic “0” after a reset and in these modes.
PS/2 Mode: In this mode the DMA and interrupt functions are always enabled. During a reset, this bit will be cleared to
a logic “0”.
Bit 4 MOTOR ENABLE 0
This bit controls the MTR0 disk interface output. A logic “1” in this bit will cause the output pin to go active.
Bit 5 MOTOR ENABLE 1
This bit controls the MTR1 disk interface output. A logic “1” in this bit will cause the output pin to go active. Note: MTR1
output is not supported.

The Tape Drive Register (TDR) is included for 82077 software compatibility and allows the user to assign tape support
to a particular drive during initialization. Any future references to that drive automatically invokes tape support. The TDR
Tape Select bits TDR.[1:0] determine the tape drive number. Table 11-4 illustrates the Tape Select Bit encoding. Note
that drive 0 is the boot device and cannot be assigned tape support. The remaining Tape Drive Register bits TDR.[7:2]
are tristated when read. The TDR is unaffected by a software reset.

This register is write only. It is used to program the data rate, amount of write precompensation, power down status, and
software reset. The data rate is programmed using the Configuration Control Register (CCR) not the DSR, for PC/AT
and PS/2 Model 30.
Other applications can set the data rate in the DSR. The data rate of the floppy controller is the most recent write of
either the DSR or CCR. The DSR is unaffected by a software reset. A hardware reset will set the DSR to 02H, which
corresponds to the default precompensation setting and 250 Kbps.
Bit 0 and 1 DATA RATE SELECT
These bits control the data rate of the floppy controller. See Table 11-7 for the settings corresponding to the individual
data rates. The data rate select bits are unaffected by a software reset, and are set to 250 Kbps after a hardware reset.
Bit 2 through 4 PRECOMPENSATION SELECT
These three bits select the value of write precompensation that will be applied to the WDATA output signal. Table 11-6
shows the precompensation values for the combination of these bits settings. Track 0 is the default starting track number
to start precompensation. This starting track number can be changed by the configure command.

11.1.6       MAIN STATUS REGISTER
Address 3F4 READ ONLY
The Main Status Register is a read-only register and indicates the status of the disk controller. The Main Status Register
can be read at any time. The MSR indicates when the disk controller is ready to receive data via the Data Register. It
should be read before each byte transferring to or from the data register except in DMA mode. No delay is required when
reading the MSR after a data transfer.

Bit 0 – 1 DRV x BUSY
These bits are set to 1s when a drive is in the seek portion of a command, including implied and overlapped seeks and
recalibrates.
Bit 4 COMMAND BUSY
This bit is set to a 1 when a command is in progress. This bit will go active after the command byte has been accepted
and goes inactive at the end of the results phase. If there is no result phase (Seek, Recalibrate commands), this bit is
returned to a 0 after the last command byte.
Bit 5 NON-DMA
Reserved, read ‘0’. This part does not support non-DMA mode.
Bit 6 DIO
Indicates the direction of a data transfer once a RQM is set. A 1 indicates a read and a 0 indicates a write is required.
Bit 7 RQM
Indicates that the host can transfer data if set to a 1. No access is permitted if set to a 0.
11.1.7       DATA REGISTER (FIFO)
Address 3F5 READ/WRITE
All command parameter information, disk data and result status are transferred between the host processor and the
floppy disk controller through the Data Register.
Data transfers are governed by the RQM and DIO bits in the Main Status Register.
The Data Register defaults to FIFO disabled mode after any form of reset. This maintains PC/AT hardware compatibility.
The default values can be changed through the Configure command (enable full FIFO operation with threshold control).
The advantage of the FIFO is that it allows the system a larger DMA latency without causing a disk error. Table 11-10
gives several examples of the delays with a FIFO.
The data is based upon the following formula:
                 Threshold # x          1/(DATA RATE)         x8       - 1.5 μs = DELAY
At the start of a command, the FIFO action is always disabled and command parameters must be sent based upon the
RQM and DIO bit settings. As the command execution phase is entered, the FIFO is cleared of any data to ensure that
invalid data is not transferred.
An overrun or underrun will terminate the current command and the transfer of data. Disk writes will complete the current
sector by generating a 00 pattern and valid CRC. Reads require the host to remove the remaining data so that the result
phase may be entered.

11.3      Reset
There are three sources of system reset on the FDC: the PCI RESET# pin, a reset generated via a bit in the DOR, and
a reset generated via a bit in the DSR. At power on, a Power On Reset initializes the FDC. All resets take the FDC out
of the power down state.
All operations are terminated upon a PCI RESET#, and the FDC enters an idle state. A reset while a disk write is in
progress will corrupt the data and CRC.
On exiting the reset state, various internal registers are cleared, including the Configure command information, and the
FDC waits for a new command. Drive polling will start unless disabled by a new Configure command.
PCI RESET# Pin (Hardware Reset)
The PCI RESET# pin is a global reset and clears all registers except those programmed by the Specify command. The
DOR reset bit is enabled and must be cleared by the host to exit the reset state.

SCH5627P
DOR Reset vs. DSR Reset (Software Reset)
These two resets are functionally the same. Both will reset the FDC core, which affects drive status information and the
FIFO circuits. The DSR reset clears itself automatically while the DOR reset requires the host to manually clear it. DOR
reset has precedence over the DSR reset. The DOR reset is set automatically upon a pin reset. The user must manually
clear this reset bit in the DOR to exit the reset state.
11.4       Modes of Operation
The FDC has three modes of operation, PC/AT mode, PS/2 mode and Model 30 mode. These are determined by the
state of the Interface Mode bits in LD0-CRF0[3,2].
PC/AT Mode
The PC/AT register set is enabled, the DMA enable bit of the DOR becomes valid (controls the interrupt and DMA func-
tions), and DENSEL is an active high signal.
PS/2 Mode
This mode supports the PS/2 models 50/60/80 configuration and register set. The DMA bit of the DOR becomes a “don’t
care”. The DMA and interrupt functions are always enabled, and DENSEL is active low.
Model 30 mode
This mode supports PS/2 Model 30 configuration and register set. The DMA enable bit of the DOR becomes valid (con-
trols the interrupt and DMA functions), and DENSEL is active low.
11.5       DMA Transfers
DMA transfers are enabled with the Specify command and are initiated by the FDC by activating a DMA request cycle.
DMA read, write and verify cycles are supported. The FDC supports two DMA transfer modes: Single Transfer and Burst
Transfer. Burst mode is enabled via Logical Device 0-CRF0-Bit[1] (LD0-CRF0[1]).
11.6       Controller Phases
For simplicity, command handling in the FDC can be divided into three phases: Command, Execution, and Result. Each
phase is described in the following sections.
11.6.1        COMMAND PHASE
After a reset, the FDC enters the command phase and is ready to accept a command from the host. For each of the
commands, a defined set of command code bytes and parameter bytes has to be written to the FDC before the com-
mand phase is complete. (Please refer to Table 11-15 on page 111 for the command set descriptions). These bytes of
data must be transferred in the order prescribed.
Before writing to the FDC, the host must examine the RQM and DIO bits of the Main Status Register. RQM and DIO
must be equal to “1” and “0” respectively before command bytes may be written. RQM is set false by the FDC after each
write cycle until the received byte is processed. The FDC asserts RQM again to request each parameter byte of the
command unless an illegal command condition is detected. After the last parameter byte is received, RQM remains “0”
and the FDC automatically enters the next phase as defined by the command definition.
The FIFO is disabled during the command phase to provide for the proper handling of the “Invalid Command” condition.
11.6.2        EXECUTION PHASE
All data transfers to or from the FDC occur during the execution phase, which can proceed in DMA mode as indicated
in the Specify command.
After a reset, the FIFO is disabled. Each data byte is transferred by a read/write or DMA cycle depending on the DMA
mode. The Configure command can enable the FIFO and set the FIFO threshold value.
The following paragraphs detail the operation of the FIFO flow control. In these descriptions, <threshold> is defined as
the number of bytes available to the FDC when service is requested from the host and ranges from 1 to 16. The param-
eter FIFOTHR, which the user programs, is one less and ranges from 0 to 15.
A low threshold value (i.e. 2) results in longer periods of time between service requests, but requires faster servicing of
the request for both read and write cases. The host reads (writes) from (to) the FIFO until empty (full), then the transfer
request goes inactive. The host must be very responsive to the service request. This is the desired case for use with a
“fast” system.

                                                                                                 SCH5627P
A high value of threshold (i.e. 12) is used with a “sluggish” system by affording a long latency period after a service
request, but results in more frequent service requests.
Non-DMA Mode – Transfers from the FIFO to the Host
This part does not support non-DMA mode.
Non-DMA Mode – Transfers from the Host to the FIFO
This part does not support non-DMA mode.
DMA Mode – Transfers from the FIFO to the Host
The FDC generates a DMA request cycle when the FIFO contains (16 - <threshold>) bytes, or the last byte of a full
sector transfer has been placed in the FIFO. The DMA controller must respond to the request by reading data from the
FIFO. The FDC will deactivate the DMA request when the FIFO becomes empty by generating the proper sync for the
data transfer.
DMA Mode – Transfers from the Host to the FIFO.
The FDC generates a DMA request cycle when entering the execution phase of the data transfer commands. The DMA
controller must respond by placing data in the FIFO. The DMA request remains active until the FIFO becomes full. The
DMA request cycle is reasserted when the FIFO has <threshold> bytes remaining in the FIFO. The FDC will terminate
the DMA cycle after a TC, indicating that no more data is required.
Data Transfer Termination
The FDC supports terminal count explicitly through the TC pin and implicitly through the underrun/overrun and end-of-
track (EOT) functions. For full sector transfers, the EOT parameter can define the last sector to be transferred in a single
or multi-sector transfer.
If the last sector to be transferred is a partial sector, the host can stop transferring the data in mid-sector, and the FDC
will continue to complete the sector as if a TC cycle was received. The only difference between these implicit functions
and TC cycle is that they return “abnormal termination” result status. Such status indications can be ignored if they were
expected.
Note that when the host is sending data to the FIFO of the FDC, the internal sector count will be complete when the
FDC reads the last byte from its side of the FIFO. There may be a delay in the removal of the transfer request signal of
up to the time taken for the FDC to read the last 16 bytes from the FIFO. The host must tolerate this delay.
11.6.3        RESULT PHASE
The generation of the interrupt determines the beginning of the result phase. For each of the commands, a defined set
of result bytes has to be read from the FDC before the result phase is complete. These bytes of data must be read out
for another command to start.
RQM and DIO must both equal “1” before the result bytes may be read. After all the result bytes have been read, the
RQM and DIO bits switch to “1” and “0” respectively, and the CB bit is cleared, indicating that the FDC is ready to accept
the next command.
11.7       Command Set/Descriptions
Commands can be written whenever the FDC is in the command phase. Each command has a unique set of needed
parameters and status results. The FDC checks to see that the first byte is a valid command and, if valid, proceeds with
the command. If it is invalid, an interrupt is issued. The user sends a Sense Interrupt Status command which returns an
invalid command error. Refer to Table 11-15 for explanations of the various symbols used. Table 11-16 lists the required
parameters and the results associated with each command that the FDC is capable of performing.

 DTL           Special Sector Size  By setting N to zero (00), DTL may be used to control the number of bytes
                                    transferred in disk read/write commands. The sector size (N = 0) is set to
                                    128. If the actual sector (on the diskette) is larger than DTL, the remainder
                                    of the actual sector is read but is not passed to the host during read
                                    commands; during write commands, the remainder of the actual sector is
                                    written with all zero bytes. The CRC check code is calculated with the actual
                                    sector. When N is not zero, DTL has no meaning and should be set to FF
                                    HEX.
 EC            Enable Count         When this bit is “1” the “DTL” parameter of the Verify command becomes SC

 HLT           Head Load Time       The time interval that FDC waits after loading the head and before initializing
                                    a read or write operation. Refer to the Specify command for actual delays.
 HUT           Head Unload Time     The time interval from the end of the execution phase (of a read or write
                                    command) until the head is unloaded. Refer to the Specify command for
                                    actual delays.
 LOCK                               Lock defines whether EFIFO, FIFOTHR, and PRETRK parameters of the
                                    CONFIGURE COMMAND can be reset to their default values by a “software

                                    or DOR)
 MFM           MFM/FM Mode          A one selects the double density (MFM) mode. A zero selects single density
               Selector             (FM) mode.
 MT            Multi-Track Selector When set, this flag selects the multi-track operating mode. In this mode, the
                                    FDC treats a complete cylinder under head 0 and 1 as a single track. The
                                    FDC operates as this expanded track started at the first sector under head
                                    0 and ended at the last sector under head 1. With this flag set, a multitrack
                                    read or write operation will automatically continue to the first sector under
                                    head 1 when the FDC finishes operating on the last sector under head 0.
 N             Sector Size Code     This specifies the number of bytes in a sector. If this parameter is “00”, then

                                    by the DTL parameter. Otherwise the sector size is (2 raised to the “Nth”
                                    power) times 128. All values up to “07” hex are allowable. “07”h would equal
                                    a sector size of 16k. It is the user's responsibility to not select combinations
                                    that are not possible with the drive.

SC is returned if the last command that was issued was the Format command. EOT is returned if the last command was
a Read or Write.
    Note 11-2     These bits are used internally only. They are not reflected in the Drive Select pins. It is the user’s
                  responsibility to maintain correspondence between these bits and the Drive Select pins (DOR).
11.9       Data Transfer Commands
All of the Read Data, Write Data and Verify type commands use the same parameter bytes and return the same results
information, the only difference being the coding of bits 0-4 in the first byte.
An implied seek will be executed if the feature was enabled by the Configure command. This seek is completely trans-
parent to the user. The Drive Busy bit for the drive will go active in the Main Status Register during the seek portion of
the command. If the seek portion fails, it is reflected in the results status normally returned for a Read/Write Data com-
mand. Status Register 0 (ST0) would contain the error code and C would contain the cylinder on which the seek failed.
11.9.1        READ DATA
A set of nine (9) bytes is required to place the FDC in the Read Data Mode. After the Read Data command has been
issued, the FDC loads the head (if it is in the unloaded state), waits the specified head settling time (defined in the Spec-
ify command), and begins reading ID Address Marks and ID fields. When the sector address read off the diskette
matches with the sector address specified in the command, the FDC reads the sector’s data field and transfers the data
to the FIFO.
After completion of the read operation from the current sector, the sector address is incremented by one and the data
from the next logical sector is read and output via the FIFO. This continuous read function is called “Multi-Sector Read
Operation”. Upon receipt of the TC cycle, or an implied TC (FIFO overrun/underrun), the FDC stops sending data but
will continue to read data from the current sector, check the CRC bytes, and at the end of the sector, terminate the Read
Data Command.
N determines the number of bytes per sector (see Table 11-17). If N is set to zero, the sector size is set to 128. The DTL
value determines the number of bytes to be transferred. If DTL is less than 128, the FDC transfers the specified number
of bytes to the host. For reads, it continues to read the entire 128-byte sector and checks for CRC errors. For writes, it
completes the 128-byte sector by filling in zeros. If N is not set to 00 Hex, DTL should be set to FF Hex and has no
impact on the number of bytes transferred.

 00            128 bytes

The amount of data which can be handled with a single command to the FDC depends upon MT (multi-track) and N
(number of bytes/sector).
The Multi-Track function (MT) allows the FDC to read data from both sides of the diskette. For a particular cylinder, data
will be transferred starting at Sector 1, Side 0 and completing the last sector of the same track at Side 1.
If the host terminates a read or write operation in the FDC, the ID information in the result phase is dependent upon the
state of the MT bit and EOT byte. Refer to Table 11-18.

At the completion of the Read Data command, the head is not unloaded until after the Head Unload Time Interval (spec-
ified in the Specify command) has elapsed. If the host issues another command before the head unloads, then the head
settling time may be saved between subsequent reads.
If the FDC detects a pulse on the INDEX# pin twice without finding the specified sector (meaning that the diskette’s index
hole passes through index detect logic in the drive twice), the FDC sets the IC code in Status Register 0 to “01” indi-
cating abnormal termination, sets the ND bit in Status Register 1 to “1” indicating a sector not found, and terminates the
Read Data Command.
After reading the ID and Data Fields in each sector, the FDC checks the CRC bytes. If a CRC error occurs in the ID or
data field, the FDC sets the IC code in Status Register 0 to “01” indicating abnormal termination, sets the DE bit flag in
Status Register 1 to “1”, sets the DD bit in Status Register 2 to “1” if CRC is incorrect in the ID field, and terminates the
Read Data Command. Table 11-19 describes the effect of the SK bit on the Read Data command execution and results.
Except where noted in Table 11-19, the C or R value of the sector address is automatically incremented (see Table 11-
21 on page 126).

11.9.3       READ A TRACK
This command is similar to the Read Data command except that the entire data field is read continuously from each of
the sectors of a track. Immediately after encountering a pulse on the INDEX# pin, the FDC starts to read all data fields
on the track as continuous blocks of data without regard to logical sector numbers. If the FDC finds an error in the ID or
DATA CRC check bytes, it continues to read data from the track and sets the appropriate error bits at the end of the
command. The FDC compares the ID information read from each sector with the specified value in the command and
sets the ND flag of Status Register 1 to a “1” if there no comparison. Multi-track or skip operations are not allowed with
this command. The MT and SK bits (bits D7 and D5 of the first command byte respectively) should always be set to “0”.
This command terminates when the EOT specified number of sectors has not been read. If the FDC does not find an
ID Address Mark on the diskette after the second occurrence of a pulse on the INDEX# pin, then it sets the IC code in
Status Register 0 to “01” (abnormal termination), sets the MA bit in Status Register 1 to “1”, and terminates the com-
mand.

NC: No Change, the same value as the one at the beginning of command execution.
LSB: Least Significant Bit, the LSB of H is complemented.
11.9.4       WRITE DATA
After the Write Data command has been issued, the FDC loads the head (if it is in the unloaded state), waits the specified
head load time if unloaded (defined in the Specify command), and begins reading ID fields. When the sector address
read from the diskette matches the sector address specified in the command, the FDC reads the data from the host via
the FIFO and writes it to the sector’s data field.
After writing data into the current sector, the FDC computes the CRC value and writes it into the CRC field at the end of
the sector transfer. The Sector Number stored in “R” is incremented by one, and the FDC continues writing to the next
data field. The FDC continues this “Multi-Sector Write Operation”. Upon receipt of a terminal count signal or if a FIFO
over/under run occurs while a data field is being written, then the remainder of the data field is filled with zeros. The
FDC reads the ID field of each sector and checks the CRC bytes. If it detects a CRC error in one of the ID fields, it sets
the IC code in Status Register 0 to “01” (abnormal termination), sets the DE bit of Status Register 1 to “1”, and terminates
the Write Data command.
The Write Data command operates in much the same manner as the Read Data command. The following items are the
same. Please refer to the Read Data Command for details:

11.9.5        WRITE DELETED DATA
This command is almost the same as the Write Data command except that a Deleted Data Address Mark is written at
the beginning of the Data Field instead of the normal Data Address Mark. This command is typically used to mark a bad
sector containing an error on the floppy disk.
11.9.6        VERIFY
The Verify command is used to verify the data stored on a disk. This command acts exactly like a Read Data command
except that no data is transferred to the host. Data is read from the disk and CRC is computed and checked against the
previously-stored value.
Because data is not transferred to the host, the TC cycle cannot be used to terminate this command. By setting the EC
bit to “1”, an implicit TC will be issued to the FDC. This implicit TC will occur when the SC value has decremented to 0
(an SC value of 0 will verify 256 sectors). This command can also be terminated by setting the EC bit to “0” and the EOT
value equal to the final sector to be checked. If EC is set to “0”, DTL/SC should be programmed to 0FFH. Refer to
Table 11-21 on page 126 and Table 11-22 on page 127 for information concerning the values of MT and EC versus SC
and EOT value.
Definitions:
# Sectors Per Side = Number of formatted sectors per each side of the disk.
# Sectors Remaining = Number of formatted sectors left which can be read, including side 1 of the disk if MT is set to “1”.

   Note 11-3       If MT is set to “1” and the SC value is greater than the number of remaining formatted sectors on
                   Side 0, verifying will continue on Side 1 of the disk.
11.9.7        FORMAT A TRACK
The Format command allows an entire track to be formatted. After a pulse from the INDEX# pin is detected, the FDC
starts writing data on the disk including gaps, address marks, ID fields, and data fields per the IBM System 34 or 3740
format (MFM or FM respectively). The particular values that will be written to the gap and data field are controlled by the
values programmed into N, SC, GPL, and D which are specified by the host during the command phase. The data field
of the sector is filled with the data byte specified by D. The ID field for each sector is supplied by the host; that is, four
data bytes per sector are needed by the FDC for C, H, R, and N (cylinder, head, sector number and sector size respec-
tively).
After formatting each sector, the host must send new values for C, H, R and N to the FDC for the next sector on the
track. The R value (sector number) is the only value that must be changed by the host after each sector is formatted.
This allows the disk to be formatted with nonsequential sector addresses (interleaving). Incrementing and formatting
continues for the whole track until the FDC encounters a pulse on the INDEX# pin again and terminates the command.
Table 11-24 on page 128 contains typical values for gap fields which are dependent upon the size of the sector and the
number of sectors on each track. Actual values can vary due to drive electronics.

11.9.8        CONTROL COMMANDS
Control commands differ from the other commands in that no data transfer takes place. Three commands generate an
interrupt when complete: Read ID, Recalibrate, and Seek. The other control commands do not generate an interrupt.
Read ID
The Read ID command is used to find the present position of the recording heads. The FDC stores the values from the
first ID field it is able to read into its registers. If the FDC does not find an ID address mark on the diskette after the
second occurrence of a pulse on the INDEX# pin, it then sets the IC code in Status Register 0 to “01” (abnormal termi-
nation), sets the MA bit in Status Register 1 to “1”, and terminates the command.
The following commands will generate an interrupt upon completion. They do not return any result bytes. It is highly
recommended that control commands be followed by the Sense Interrupt Status command. Otherwise, valuable inter-
rupt status information will be lost.
Recalibrate
The Recalibrate Command causes the read/write head within the FDC to retract to the track 0 position. The FDC clears
the contents of the PCN counter and checks the status of the TRK0# pin from the FDD. As long as the TRK0# pin is
low, the DIR pin remains 0 and step pulses are issued. When the TRK0# pin goes high, the SE bit in Status Register 0
is set to “1” and the command is terminated. If the TRK0# pin is still low after 79 step pulses have been issued, the FDC
sets the SE and the EC bits of Status Register 0 to “1” and terminates the command. Disks capable of handling more
than 80 tracks per side may require more than one Recalibrate command to return the head back to physical Track 0.
This command does not have a result phase. The Sense Interrupt Status command must be issued after the Recalibrate
command to effectively terminate it and provide verification of the head position (PCN). During the command phase of
the recalibrate operation, the FDC is in the BUSY state, but during the execution phase it is in a NON-BUSY state. At
this time, another Recalibrate command may be issued, and in this manner parallel Recalibrate operations may be done
on up to four drives at once. Upon power up, the software must issue a Recalibrate command to properly initialize all
drives and the controller.
Seek
The read/write head within the drive is moved from track to track under the control of the Seek command. The FDC
compares the PCN, which is the current head position, with the NCN and performs the following operation if there is a
difference:
• PCN < NCN:             Direction signal to drive set to “1” (step in) and issues step pulses.
• PCN > NCN:             Direction signal to drive set to “0” (step out) and issues step pulses.
The rate at which step pulses are issued is controlled by SRT (Stepping Rate Time) in the Specify command. After each
step pulse is issued, NCN is compared against PCN, and when NCN = PCN the SE bit in Status Register 0 is set to “1”
and the command is terminated. During the command phase of the seek or recalibrate operation, the FDC is in the
BUSY state, but during the execution phase it is in the NON-BUSY state. At this time, another Seek or Recalibrate com-
mand may be issued, and in this manner, parallel seek operations may be done on up to four drives at once.
Note that if implied seek is not enabled, the read and write commands should be preceded by:
1.    Seek command - Step to the proper track
2.    Sense Interrupt Status command - Terminate the Seek command
3.    Read ID - Verify head is on proper track
4.    Issue Read/Write command.
The Seek command does not have a result phase. It is highly recommended that the Sense Interrupt Status command
is issued after the Seek command to terminate it and provide verification of the head position (PCN). The H bit (Head
Address) in ST0 will always return to a “0”. When exiting POWERDOWN mode, the FDC clears the PCN value and the
status information to zero. Prior to issuing the POWERDOWN command, it is highly recommended that the user service
all pending interrupts through the Sense Interrupt Status command.
11.10 Sense Interrupt Status
An interrupt signal is generated by the FDC for one of the following reasons:
1.    Upon entering the Result Phase of:
a)    Read Data command
b)    Read A Track command
c)    Read ID command

e)    Write Data command
f)    Format A Track command
g)    Write Deleted Data command
h)    Verify command
2.    End of Seek, Relative Seek, or Recalibrate command
The Sense Interrupt Status command resets the interrupt signal and, via the IC code and SE bit of Status Register 0,
identifies the cause of the interrupt.

 1                      01                   Abnormal termination of Seek or Recalibrate command
The Seek, Relative Seek, and Recalibrate commands have no result phase. The Sense Interrupt Status command must
be issued immediately after these commands to terminate them and to provide verification of the head position (PCN).
The H (Head Address) bit in ST0 will always return a “0”. If a Sense Interrupt Status is not issued, the drive will continue
to be BUSY and may affect the operation of the next command.
Sense Drive Status
Sense Drive Status obtains drive status information. It has not execution phase and goes directly to the result phase
from the command phase. Status Register 3 contains the drive status information.
Specify
The Specify command sets the initial values for each of the three internal times. The HUT (Head Unload Time) defines
the time from the end of the execution phase of one of the read/write commands to the head unload state. The SRT
(Step Rate Time) defines the time interval between adjacent step pulses. Note the spacing between the first and second
step pulses may be shorter than the remaining step pulses. The HLT (Head Load Time) defines the time between when
the Head Load signal goes high and the read/write operation starts. The values change with the data rate speed selec-
tion and are documented in Table 11-26. The values are the same for MFM and FM.
DMA operation is selected by the ND bit. When ND is “0”, the DMA mode is selected. This part does not support non-
DMA mode. In DMA mode, data transfers are signaled by the DMA request cycles.
Configure
The Configure command is issued to select the special features of the FDC. A Configure command need not be issued
if the default values of the FDC meet the system requirements.

Configure Default Values:
EIS - No Implied Seeks
EFIFO - FIFO Disabled
POLL - Polling Enabled
FIFOTHR - FIFO Threshold Set to 1 Byte
PRETRK - Pre-Compensation Set to Track 0
EIS - Enable Implied Seek. When set to “1”, the FDC will perform a Seek operation before executing a read or write
command. Defaults to no implied seek.
EFIFO - A “1” disables the FIFO (default). This means data transfers are asked for on a byte-by-byte basis. Defaults to
“1”, FIFO disabled. The threshold defaults to “1”.
POLL - Disable polling of the drives. Defaults to “0”, polling enabled. When enabled, a single interrupt is generated after
a reset. No polling is performed while the drive head is loaded and the head unload delay has not expired.
FIFOTHR - The FIFO threshold in the execution phase of read or write commands. This is programmable from 1 to 16
bytes. Defaults to one byte. A “00” selects one byte; “0F” selects 16 bytes.
PRETRK - Pre-Compensation Start Track Number. Programmable from track 0 to 255. Defaults to track 0. A “00” selects
track 0; “FF” selects track 255.
Version
The Version command checks to see if the controller is an enhanced type or the older type (765A). A value of 90 H is
returned as the result byte.
Relative Seek
The command is coded the same as for Seek, except for the MSB of the first byte and the DIR bit.
DIR     Head Step Direction Control
RCN Relative Cylinder Number that determines how many tracks to step the head in or out from the current track num-
        ber.
   DIR               Action
 0         Step Head Out
 1         Step Head In
The Relative Seek command differs from the Seek command in that it steps the head the absolute number of tracks
specified in the command instead of making a comparison against an internal register. The Seek command is good for
drives that support a maximum of 256 tracks. Relative Seeks cannot be overlapped with other Relative Seeks. One Rel-
ative Seek can be active at a time. Relative Seeks may be overlapped with Seeks and Recalibrates. Bit 4 of Status Reg-
ister 0 (EC) will be set if Relative Seek attempts to step outward beyond Track 0.
As an example, assume that a floppy drive has 300 usable tracks. The host needs to read track 300 and the head is on
any track (0-255). If a Seek command is issued, the head will stop at track 255. If a Relative Seek command is issued,
the FDC will move the head the specified number of tracks, regardless of the internal cylinder position register (but will
increment the register). If the head was on track 40 (d), the maximum track that the FDC could position the head on
using Relative Seek will be 295 (D), the initial track + 255 (D). The maximum count that the head can be moved with a
single Relative Seek command is 255 (D).
The internal register, PCN, will overflow as the cylinder number crosses track 255 and will contain 39 (D). The resulting
PCN value is thus (RCN + PCN) mod 256. Functionally, the FDC starts counting from 0 again as the track number goes
above 255 (D). It is the user’s responsibility to compensate FDC functions (precompensation track number) when
accessing tracks greater than 255. The FDC does not keep track that it is working in an “extended track area” (greater
than 255). Any command issued will use the current PCN value except for the Recalibrate command, which only looks
for the TRACK0 signal. Recalibrate will return an error if the head is farther than 79 due to its limitation of issuing a max-
imum of 80 step pulses. The user simply needs to issue a second Recalibrate command. The Seek command and
implied seeks will function correctly within the 44 (D) track (299-255) area of the “extended track area”. It is the user’s
responsibility not to issue a new track position that will exceed the maximum track that is present in the extended area.

SCH5627P
To return to the standard floppy range (0-255) of tracks, a Relative Seek should be issued to cross the track 255 bound-
ary.
A Relative Seek can be used instead of the normal Seek, but the host is required to calculate the difference between
the current head location and the new (target) head location. This may require the host to issue a Read ID command to
ensure that the head is physically on the track that software assumes it to be. Different FDC commands will return dif-
ferent cylinder results which may be difficult to keep track of with software without the Read ID command.
Perpendicular Mode
The Perpendicular Mode command should be issued prior to executing Read/Write/Format commands that access a
disk drive with perpendicular recording capability. With this command, the length of the Gap2 field and VCO enable tim-
ing can be altered to accommodate the unique requirements of these drives. Table 11-27 on page 133 describes the
effects of the WGATE and GAP bits for the Perpendicular Mode command. Upon a reset, the FDC will default to the
conventional mode (WGATE = 0, GAP = 0).
Selection of the 500 Kbps and 1 Mbps perpendicular modes is independent of the actual data rate selected in the Data
Rate Select Register. The user must ensure that these two data rates remain consistent.
The Gap2 and VCO timing requirements for perpendicular recording type drives are dictated by the design of the
read/write head. In the design of this head, a pre-erase head precedes the normal read/write head by a distance of 200
micrometers. This works out to about 38 bytes at a 1 Mbps recording density. Whenever the write head is enabled by
the Write Gate signal, the pre-erase head is also activated at the same time. Thus, when the write head is initially turned
on, flux transitions recorded on the media for the first 38 bytes will not be preconditioned with the pre-erase head since
it has not yet been activated. To accommodate this head activation and deactivation time, the Gap2 field is expanded
to a length of 41 bytes. The Format Fields table illustrates the change in the Gap2 field size for the perpendicular format.
On the read back by the FDC, the controller must begin synchronization at the beginning of the sync field. For the con-
ventional mode, the internal PLL VCO is enabled (VCOEN) approximately 24 bytes from the start of the Gap2 field. But,
when the controller operates in the 1 Mbps perpendicular mode (WGATE = 1, GAP = 1), VCOEN goes active after 43
bytes to accommodate the increased Gap2 field size. For both cases, and approximate two-byte cushion is maintained
from the beginning of the sync field for the purposes of avoiding write splices in the presence of motor speed variation.
For the Write Data case, the FDC activates Write Gate at the beginning of the sync field under the conventional mode.
The controller then writes a new sync field, data address mark, data field, and CRC. With the pre-erase head of the
perpendicular drive, the write head must be activated in the Gap2 field to insure a proper write of the new sync field. For
the 1 Mbps perpendicular mode (WGATE = 1, GAP = 1), 38 bytes will be written in the Gap2 space. Since the bit density
is proportional to the data rate, 19 bytes will be written in the Gap2 field for the 500 Kbps perpendicular mode (WGATE
= 1, GAP =0).
It should be noted that none of the alterations in Gap2 size, VCO timing, or Write Gate timing affect normal program
flow. The information provided here is just for background purposes and is not needed for normal operation. Once the
Perpendicular Mode command is invoked, FDC software behavior from the user standpoint is unchanged.
The perpendicular mode command is enhanced to allow specific drives to be designated Perpendicular recording
drives. This enhancement allows data transfers between Conventional and Perpendicular drives without having to issue
Perpendicular mode commands between the accesses of the different drive types, nor having to change write pre-com-
pensation values.
When both GAP and WGATE bits of the PERPENDICULAR MODE COMMAND are both programmed to “0” (Conven-
tional mode), then D0, D1, D2, D3, and D4 can be programmed independently to “1” for that drive to be set automatically
to Perpendicular mode. In this mode the following set of conditions also apply:
• The GAP2 written to a perpendicular drive during a write operation will depend upon the programmed data rate.
• The write pre-compensation given to a perpendicular mode drive will be 0ns.
• For D0-D3 programmed to “0” for conventional mode drives any data written will be at the currently programmed
   write pre-compensation.
   Note 11-4      Bits D0-D3 can only be overwritten when OW is programmed as a “1”.If either GAP or WGATE is a
                  “1” then D0-D3 are ignored.
Software and hardware resets have the following effect on the PERPENDICULAR MODE COMMAND:
1.    “Software” resets (via the DOR or DSR registers) will only clear GAP and WGATE bits to “0”. D0-D3 are unaf-
      fected and retain their previous value.
2.    “Hardware” resets will clear all bits (GAP, WGATE and D0-D3) to “0”, i.e all conventional mode.

Lock
In order to protect systems with long DMA latencies against older application software that can disable the FIFO the
LOCK Command has been added. This command should only be used by the FDC routines, and application software
should refrain from using it. If an application calls for the FIFO to be disabled then the CONFIGURE command should
be used.
The LOCK command defines whether the EFIFO, FIFOTHR, and PRETRK parameters of the CONFIGURE command
can be RESET by the DOR and DSR registers. When the LOCK bit is set to logic “1” all subsequent “software RESETS
by the DOR and DSR registers will not change the previously set parameters to their default values. All “hardware”
RESET from the PCI RESET# pin will set the LOCK bit to logic “0” and return the EFIFO, FIFOTHR, and PRETRK to
their default values. A status byte is returned immediately after issuing a LOCK command. This byte reflects the value
of the LOCK bit set by the command byte.
Enhanced Dumpreg
The DUMPREG command is designed to support system run-time diagnostics and application software development
and debug. To accommodate the LOCK command and the enhanced PERPENDICULAR MODE command the eighth
byte of the DUMPREG command has been modified to contain the additional data from these two commands.
11.11 Compatibility
The SCH5627P was designed with software compatibility in mind. It is a fully backwards- compatible solution with the
older generation 765A/B disk controllers. The FDC also implements on-board registers for compatibility with the PS/2,
as well as PC/AT and PC/XT, floppy disk controller subsystems. After a hardware reset of the FDC, all registers, func-
tions and enhancements default to a PC/AT, PS/2 or PS/2 Model 30 compatible operating mode, depending on how the
IDENT and MFM bits are configured by the system BIOS.
11.12 Floppy Drive Presence Detection
The Floppy Drive Presence Detection Circuit is illustrated in Figure 11-1. The nDIR pin is an output pin on the
SCH5627P Floppy Interface. Standard Floppy Peripherals have a strong pull-ups on this pin. The SCH5627P has an
on chip 90μA weak pull-down which is selectively activated to detect the presence of the nDIR pull-up from the Floppy
peripheral. The 90μA weak pull-down is deactivated when PCI RESET# is asserted or once the Floppy activate bit
(LD0,CR0x30-bit0) is set to ‘1’.
The state of the nDIR pin is reported to the FDSTAT bit at LD0,CR0xF3-bit0. See Section 11.12.1, "FDSTAT Register,"
on page 134.
APPLICATION NOTE: The programmer can read the state of the FDSTAT bit at LD0,CR0xF3-bit0, If this bit is set
                          to ‘1’, the a FDD is present and in the normal course of initializing the floppy, the programmer
                          will set the Floppy activate bit (LD0,CR0xF3-bit0) is set to ‘1’.

12.0      EMBEDDED MEMORY INTERFACE
12.1      General Description
The Embedded Memory Interface provides a standard run-time mechanism for the host to communicate with the
Embedded Controller (EC) and other logical components in the SCH5627P Block Diagram. The Embedded Memory
Interface includes 12 byte-addressable registers in the Host’s I/O address space, as well as 20 bytes of registers that
are accessible only by the EC. The Embedded Memory Interface can be used by the Host to read any byte in a region
of EC closely-coupled memory, designated by the EC, without requiring any assistance from the EC. In addition, a por-
tion of the memory can be can be configured so that it can be written by the Host without any EC assistance.

12.2      Reset
This block is reset when nSYS_RST is asserted.
12.3      Interrupts
The Host can generate interrupt events to the EC, as described in Section 12.3.1, "EC Interrupts". In addition, the EC
can generate events to the Host, either directly through a SERIRQ, or in conjunction with the PME/SMI logic. The EC
to Host interrupts are described in Section 12.3.2, "Embedded Memory Interface SERIRQ Routing" and in Section
12.3.3, "Embedded Memory Interface PME/SMI Routing" and illustrated in FIGURE 16-1: SMI/PME Interrupt Routing
on page 150.
12.3.1       EC INTERRUPTS
The Embedded Memory Interface can generate an interrupt event for HOST-to-EC events. See the HOST-to-EC Mail-
box Register on page 140. The interrupt for the EMI is routed onto the EM_Int bit in the GIRQ15 Source register.
12.3.2       EMBEDDED MEMORY INTERFACE SERIRQ ROUTING
The EC can use the Embedded Memory Interface to generate SERIRQ events for EC-to-HOST EC events. There are
two methods by which the EC generates SERIRQ events to the Host: writes to the EC-to-Host Mailbox Register, and
writes to the EC_SWI bits in the Interrupt Source Register.
 2009 - 2015 Microchip Technology Inc.                                                          DS00001996A-page 135


SCH5627P
Writes to the EC-to-Host Mailbox Register generate an interrupt that is routed to the SERIRQ block (see Section 7.6.1,
"SERIRQ Configuration Registers," on page 43). For this interrupt, the SELECT bit is set to ‘0’ in the Interrupt Configu-
ration Register. This interrupt signal is an active high level interrupt, so the selected SERIRQ channel will be high when
the EM interrupt is asserted.
The EC can also generate an event by setting to 1 any of the EC_SWI bits in the Interrupt Source Register that are
enabled by a 1 in the corresponding EC_SWI_EN bits in the Interrupt Mask Register. This event is also asserted by a
write to the EC-to-Host Mailbox Register if the EC_WR_EN is 1. The event can be routed to any frame in the SERIRQ
stream. For this interrupt, the SELECT bit is set to ‘1’ in the Interrupt Configuration Register. This interrupt signal is active
low, so the selected SERIRQ channel will be low when the EM interrupt is asserted. The assertion level matches the
level of the IO_SMI# pin, when an SMI is asserted through the Runtime Registers block because of the EMI software
interrupt bits.
12.3.3       EMBEDDED MEMORY INTERFACE PME/SMI ROUTING
The two signals from the EMI that are used to generate SERIRQ events can also be used to generate either PME or
SMI events.
EM_EVT1 is asserted when the EC writes the EC-to-Host Mailbox Register. EM_EVT1 is an active high level, and is
equivalent to the SELECT=0 SERIRQ interrupt. EM_EVT2 is asserted when any of the EC_SWI bits in the Interrupt
Source Register is 1 when there is a corresponding 1 bit in the EC_SWI_EN field in the Interrupt Mask Register.
EM_EVT2 is also asserted by a write to the EC-to-Host Mailbox Register if the EC_WR_EN is 1. EM_EVT2 is active
high level and is therefore the inverse of the SELECT=1 SERIRQ interrupt. EM_EVT1 and EM_EVT2 are routed to the
PME and SMI runtime registers, where they can be enabled for event generation. See Section 16.0, "Runtime Regis-
ters," on page 149 for details.
12.4      Description
The Embedded Memory Interface contains a Mailbox that enables the Host to send an 8-bit message to the EC and the
EC to send an 8-bit message to the Host. When written by the sender, the messages can generate an interrupt at the
receiver.
In addition to the messages that can be exchanged, the Embedded Memory Interface permits the Host to read and write
a portion of the EC’s Data Closely Coupled Memory (DCCM). Host reads and writes take place without intervention or
assistance from the EC.
The Embedded Memory Interface occupies 12 bytes in the Host I/O space. Two bytes constitute the Host-to-EC and
EC-to-Host message links. Six bytes are used for the interface into the EC DCCM, two for address and four for data.
The four data bytes are used for reads and writes to the EC DCCM using the EC’s Direct Memory Interface (DMI).
When the Host reads one of the four bytes in the Embedded Memory Interface data register, data from the DCCM at
the address defined by the Embedded Memory Interface address register is returned to the Host. Writes to a byte write
the corresponding byte in the DCCM. The Embedded Memory Interface can be configured so that, although Host I/O is
always byte at a time, transfers between the Embedded Memory Interface data bytes and the DCCM can configured to
occur as single bytes, 2-byte blocks or 4-byte blocks. This is done so that data that the EC treats as 16-bit or 32-bit will
be consistent in the Host, even though one byte of the DCCM data may change between two or more 8-bit accesses by
the Host.
In addition, there is an auto-increment function for the Embedded Memory Interface address register. When enabled,
the Host can read or write blocks of memory in the DCCM by repeatedly accessing the Embedded Memory Interface
data register, without requiring Host updates to the Embedded Memory Interface address register.

The Base addresses, the Read limits and the Write limits are defined by registers that are in the EC address space and
cannot be accessed by the Host. In each region, the Read limit need not be greater than the Write limit. The regions
can be contiguous or overlapping.For example, if the Region 0 Read limit is set to 0 and the Write limit is set to a positive
number, then the Embedded Memory interface defines a region in the EC memory that the EC can read and write but
is write-only for the host. This might be useful for storage of security data, which the Host might wish to send to the EC
but should not be readable in the event a virus invades the Host.

Control" shows the relationship between one off the regions in the Embedded Memory Interface and the DCCM DMI:

12.4.2        EMBEDDED MEMORY INTERFACE USAGE
The Embedded Memory Interface provides a generic facility for communication between the Host and the EC and can
be used for many functions. Some examples are:
• Virtual registers. A block of read-only memory locations in the DCCM can be used to implement a set of virtual
  registers. The EC can update these locations with that the Host can later read.
• Program downloading. Because the Instruction Closely Coupled Memory is implemented in the same SRAM as
  the DCCM, the Embedded Memory Interface can be used by the Host to download new program segments for the
  EC. The Read/Write window would be configured by the Host to point to the beginning of the loadable program
  region, which could then be loaded by the Host.
• Data exchange. The Read/Write portion of the memory window can be used to contain a communication packet.
  The Host, by default, “owns” the packet, and can write it at any time. When the Host wishes to communicate with
  the EC, it sends the EC a command, through the Host-to-EC message facility, to read the packet and perform
  some operations as a result. When it is completed processing the packet, the EC can inform the Host, either
  through a message in the EC-to-Host channel or by triggering an event such as an SMI directly. If return results
  are required, the EC can write the results into the Read/Write region, which the Host can read directly when it is
  informed that the EC has completed processing. Depending on the command, the operations could entail update
  of virtual registers in the DCCM, reads of any register in the EC address space, or writes of any register in the EC
  address space. Because there are two regions that are defined by the base registers, the memory used for the
  communication packet does not have to be contiguous with a set of virtual registers.

Because there are two Embedded Memory Interface memory regions, the Embedded Memory Interface cannot be used
for more than two of these functions at a time. The Host can request that the EC switch from one function to another
through the use of the Host-to-EC mailbox register.
The Application ID Register is provided to help software applications track ownership of an Embedded Memory Inter-
face. An application can write the Application ID Register with its Application ID, then immediately read it back. If the
read value is not the same as the value written, then another application has ownership of the interface.
   Note:    The protocol used to pass commands back and forth through the Embedded Memory Interface Registers
            Interface is left to the System designer. Microchip can provide an application example of working code in
            which the host uses the Embedded Memory Interface registers to gain access to all of the EC registers.

12.5.1      EMBEDDED MEMORY INTERFACE CONTROL REGISTERS
Mailbox Register, HOST-to-EC, and Mailbox Register, EC-to-HOST, are specifically designed to pass commands
between the host and the EC. If enabled, these registers can generate interrupts.
When the host performs a write of the HOST-to-EC mailbox register, an interrupt will be generated and seen by the EC
if unmasked.
When the EC writes the EC-to-HOST mailbox register, an SIRQ event or an event such as SMI or PME may be gener-
ated and seen by the host if unmasked.

Access_Type
This field defines the type of access that occurs when the EC Data Register is read or written.
00:     8-bit access. Any byte read of Byte 0 through Byte 3 in the EC Data Register causes the corresponding byte
within the 32-bit double word addressed by EC_Address to be loaded into the byte of EC Data Register and returned
by the read. Any byte write to Byte 0 through Byte 3 in the EC Data Register writes the corresponding byte within the
32-bit double word addressed by EC_Address, as well as the byte of the EC Data Register.
01:     16-bit access. A read of Byte 0 in the EC Data Register causes the 16 bits in the DCCM at an offset of EC_Ad-
dress to be loaded into Byte 0 and Byte 1 of the EC Data Register. The read then returns the contents of Byte 0. A read
of Byte 2 in the EC Data Register causes the 16 bits in the DCCM at an offset of EC_Address+2 to be loaded into Byte
2 and Byte 3 of the EC Data Register. The read then returns the contents of Byte 2. A read of Byte 1 or Byte 3 in the
EC Data Register return the contents of the register, without any update from the DCCM.
A write of Byte 1 in the EC Data Register causes Bytes 1 and 0 of the EC Data Register to be written into the 16 bits in
the DCCM at an offset of EC_Address. A write of Byte 3 in the EC Data Register causes Bytes 3 and 2 of the EC Data
Register to be written into the 16 bits in the DCCM at an offset of EC_Address+2. A write of Byte 0 or Byte 2 in the EC
Data Register updates the contents of the register, without any change to the DCCM.
10:     32-bit access. A read of Byte 0 in the EC Data Register causes the 32 bits in the DCCM at an offset of EC_Ad-
dress to be loaded into the entire EC Data Register. The read then returns the contents of Byte 0. A read of Byte 1, Byte
2 or Byte 3 in the EC Data Register returns the contents of the register, without any update from the DCCM.
A write of Byte 3 in the EC Data Register causes the EC Data Register to be written into the 32 bits in the DCCM at an
offset of EC_Address. A write of Byte 0, Byte 1 or Byte 2 in the EC Data Register updates the contents of the register,
without any change to the DCCM.
11:     Auto-increment 32-bit access. This defines a 32-bit access, as in the 10 case. In addition, any read or write of
Byte 3 in the EC Data Register causes the EC Address Register to be incremented by 1. That is, the EC_Address field
will point to the next 32-bit double word in the DCCM.
EC_Address[14:2]
This field defines the location in memory that can be read and/or written with the EC Data Register. The address is an
offset from the base of the Host-accessible region in the EC DCCM SRAM. The base of the Host-accessible region.
Region
The field specifies which of two segments in the on-chip SRAM is to be used in conjunction with EC_Address[14:2] to
generate accesses to the memory.

DATA
This is a 32-bit register which returns data to the Host from the EC DCCM at the address specified by EC_Address[14:2].
The description of bits Access_Type in the EC Address Register defines which reads and writes from the Host trigger
transfers of data between this register and the DCCM.
A write to the EC Data Register when the EC Address Register is in a read-only or a no-access region, as defined by
the Memory Base and Limit registers, will update the EC Data Register but memory will not be modified. A read to the
EC Data Register when the EC Address Register is in a no-access region, as defined by the Memory Base and Limit
registers, will not trigger a memory read and will not modify the EC Data Register. In auto-increment mode (Access_-
Type=11b), reads of Byte 3 of the EC Data Register will still trigger increments of the EC Address Register when the
address is out of bounds, while writes of Byte 3 will not.

SCH5627P
13.0      PME SUPPORT
The SCH5627P offers support for power management events (PMEs), also referred to as a System Control Interrupt
(SCI) events in an ACPI system. A power management event is indicated to the chipset via the assertion of the
IO_PME# signal and functions as a wake event (that is, a PME can wake a system that is in a sleep state). In the
SCH5627P, the IO_PME# is asserted by active transitions on the ring indicator inputs RI1# and RI2#, active keyboard-
data edges, active mouse-data edges, programmable edges on GPIO pins and temperature events. The
GP041/IO_PME# pin, when selected for the IO_PME# function, can be programmed to be active high or active low via
the polarity bit in the GP041 Pin Control register. The output buffer type of the pin can also be programmed to be open-
drain or push-pull.
PMEs can also be enabled onto the Serial IRQ stream, by configuring a SERIRQ channel for the Runtime Registers
Logical Device, with the SELECT function set to 0. See Section 7.6, "SERIRQ Interrupts".
   Note:     If the host enables UART2 and requires the RI2# pin for wakeup, the host should configure the Pin Control
             register for GP062/RI2# so that the Mux Control field selects RI2# and the Interrupt Detection selects falling
             edge. If the host enables UART1 and requires the RI1# pin for wakeup, the host should configure the Pin
             Control register for GP052/RI1# so that the Mux Control field selects RI1# and the Interrupt Detection
             selects falling edge.
The PME functionality is controlled by the PME_STS Register and the PME_EN Register in the Runtime Registers
block, in Logical Device A. The PME Enable bit, PME_EN, globally controls PME Wake-up events. When PME_EN is
inactive, the IO_PME# signal can not be asserted. When PME_EN is asserted, any wake source whose individual PME
Wake Enable register bit is asserted can cause IO_PME# to become asserted.
The PME Status register indicates that an enabled wake source has occurred, and if the PME_EN bit is set, asserted
the IO_PME# signal. The PME Status bit is asserted by when any PME Status bit is asserted. PME Status registers are
described in Section 16.0, "Runtime Registers", which defines whether PME Status bits are set on edge events or level
events. The PME_Status bit in the PME_STS Register will become asserted independent of the state of the global PME
enable bit, PME_EN.
The following pertains to the PME status bits for each event:
• The output of the status bit for each event is combined with the corresponding enable bit to set the PME status bit.
• The status bit for any pending events must be cleared in order to clear the PME_STS bit. Status bits are cleared
   on a write of ‘1’. Read-only status bits must be cleared at their source.
See Section 8.5.8, "Keyboard and Mouse PME Generation" in Section 8.0, "Keyboard Controller" for information about
using the keyboard and mouse signals to generate a PME.
The PME registers are located in system I/O space at an offset from the Base Address programmed for Logical Device
Ah.
See PME register descriptions in Section 16.0, "Runtime Registers".
13.1      GPIO Events
Eight GPIO pins can be used to generate Power Management Events. For GPIO events, the polarity of the edge used
to set the status bit and generate a PME is controlled by the Interrupt Detection field in the Pin Control register associ-
ated with the GPIO. These GPIOs will only generate a PME if the Interrupt Detection field is configured for edge-sensi-
tive interrupts. If the GPIO is configured for a level-sensitive interrupt, or edge detection is disabled, then the GPIO
cannot generate a PME. Status bits are cleared on a write of ‘1’. These eight GPIOs can also be used to generate Sys-
tem Management Interrupts.
13.2      Enabling SMI Events onto the PME Pin
There is a bit in the PME_STS2 Register to show the status of the internal “group” SMI signal in the PME logic (if bit 5
of the SMI_EN2 Register is set). This bit, Devint_Status, is at bit 0 of the PME_STS2 Register register. This bit is defined
as follows:
0= The group SMI output is inactive.
1= The group SMI output is active.
Devint_Status, when asserted, can generate a PME if the Devint_Status Enable bit in PME_EN2 Register is 1.

See Section 15.0, "Low Battery Detection," on page 147 for a description of Low Battery PME events.

SCH5627P
14.0       SMI SUPPORT
The SCH5627P implements a “group” IO_SMI# output pin. The System Management Interrupt is a non-maskable inter-
rupt with the highest priority level used for OS transparent power management. The SMI group interrupt output consists
of the enabled interrupts from each of the functional blocks in the chip and several of the GPIOs and the temperature
monitoring. The GP071/IO_SMI# pin, when selected for the IO_SMI# function, can be programmed to be active high or
active low via the polarity bit in the GP071 pin control register. The output buffer type of the pin can also be programmed
to be open-drain or push-pull via the pin control register.
The interrupts are enabled onto the group SMI# signal as defined in the description of the SMI_STS Register. The group
SMI# signal is then enabled onto the IO_SMI# output pin via bit[7] in the SMI Enable Register 2. The group SMI# signal
can also be enabled onto the serial IRQ stream via Bit[6] in the SMI Enable Register 2. The configuration logic for SER-
IRQ can route the SMI# signal onto any SERIRQ channel. In addition, the internal SMI can be enabled onto the
IO_PME# pin. Bit[5] of the SMI Enable Register 2 is used to enable the SMI output onto the IO_PME# pin (GP041). This
bit will enable the internal SMI output into the PME logic through the DEVINT_STS bit in PME_STS3. See Section 13.0,
"PME Support," on page 144 for more details.
14.1       SMI Registers
The event bits for generating System Management Interrupts are located in the SMI Status and Enable registers. The
SMI logic for these events is implemented such that the output of the status bit for each event is combined with the cor-
responding enable bit in order to generate an SMI.
The SMI registers are accessed at an offset from the base I/O address for logical device A (see Section 16.0, "Runtime
Registers," on page 149 for more information).
Status bits for events for super I/O devices are located in the SMI_STS1 Register and the SMI_STS2 Register. All of
these status bits are cleared at the source. The SMI logic for these events is implemented such that each event is
directly combined with the corresponding enable bit in order to generate an SMI.
SMI events for Low Bat, the EC Watchdog Timer and the GPIO events must be cleared in the SMI Status registers.
SMI_EN2 Register also contains the bit to enable the group SMI onto the IO_SMI# output pin via (bit[7]), the bit to enable
the group SMI onto the serial IRQ stream (Bit[6]) and the bit to enable the group SMI signal onto the IO_PME# pin
(Bit[5]).
14.2       GPIO SMI Events
Eight GPIO pins can be used to generate SMI events. For GPIO events, the polarity of the edge used to set the status
bit and generate an SMI is controlled by the Interrupt Detection field in the Pin Control register associated with the GPIO.
These GPIOs will only generate an SMI if the Interrupt Detection field is configured for edge-sensitive interrupts. If the
GPIO is configured for a level-sensitive interrupt, or edge detection is disabled, then the GPIO cannot generate a
SMI.These same eight GPIOs can also be used to generate Power Management Events.
14.3       Low Battery Warning SMI Event
See Section 15.0, "Low Battery Detection," on page 147 for a description of Low Battery SMI events.
The Low_Bat SMI event is indicated and enabled via the SMI_STS2 Register and the SMI_EN2 Register. See Section
16.0, "Runtime Registers," on page 149 for a description of these registers.

15.0       LOW BATTERY DETECTION
The SCH5627P can be used with an external battery to provide battery backup for the VBAT Powered RAM as well as
several internal status bits. The status of the battery voltage is checked at three different times by the SCH5627P
• When the battery is replaced while VTR power is off
• On the rising edge of VTR
• On the rising edge of VCC
bit Two state bits in Runtime space, Low_Bat in the PME_STS2 Register and Low_Bat in the SMI_STS2 Register, track
the status of the external battery. These bits can be accessed by the Host and used to generate Host events.
Figure 15-1, "External Battery Circuit", illustrates the external battery circuit:

The battery voltage measured at the VBAT pin, not at the source, so battery voltages described in this chapter incorpo-
rate the approximate 0.3V voltage drop caused by the diode in the figure.
15.1       Battery Voltage Detection
Battery voltage is monitored in the three conditions defined in the following sections:
15.1.1        VTR POWER OFF
If, while the VTR power supply is off, the external battery is removed and replaced with a battery that delivers at least
approximately 1.2V, a VBAT Power On Reset (VBAT POR) is signaled. A VBAT POR will cause the internal battery-
backed status bits to their default state. The VBAT Powered RAM is not reset, however, a VBAT POR indicates that the
contents of the VBAT Powered RAM are indeterminate. A VBAT POR sets an internal state bit that is readable and clear-
able by the EC.
Removing and replacing the external battery has no effect if VTR power is on.
15.1.2        RISING EDGE OF VTR
When VTR rises above its operational threshold, the battery voltage is checked to see if it is less than approximately
1.2V. If the battery voltage is below the 1.2V threshold, the internal VBAT POR state is set; If the battery voltage is above
the 1.2V threshold, the internal VBAT POR state is not modified.
15.1.3        RISING EDGE OF VCC
When VCC rises above its operational threshold, the VBAT pin is measured and compared to a threshold of approxi-
mately 2.2V. This threshold is only checked on the rising edge of VCC.

15.2      Low Battery Events
Both the Power Management Event logic and the System Management Interrupt logic have state bits that report the
status of VBAT voltage. These bits are Low_Bat in the PME_STS2 Register and Low_Bat in the SMI_STS2 Register.
On the rising edge of VTR, these two bits are both initialized to ‘1’ if either the battery was replaced while VTR was off,
or the battery was below threshold when VTR reached its operational threshold. In addition, both bits are set to ‘1’ if the
battery voltage is below approximately 2.2V when VCC rises above its operational threshold. Neither Low_Bat bit is
modified if the battery voltage is above approximately 2.2V when VCC rises.
Both Low_Bat status bits can only be cleared when written with a ‘1’ by software.
Since the PME enable bit is not battery backed up and is cleared on VTR POR, the Low_Bat PME status bit is not nor-
mally a wakeup event since it cannot be enabled when VTR is on but VCC is off. When VCC returns, if the PME or SMI
enable bit (and other associated enable bits) are set while the respective Low_Bat bits are ‘1’, then the corresponding
event will be generated.
Both the PME and SMI Low_Bat status bits can be enabled while VCC is active. No event will be generated if neither
status bit is set when enabled. If VCC goes away, the Low_Bat enable bits will remain active, but no event will be trig-
gered because neither Low_Bat status bit can be triggered while operating on VTR power alone. When VCC returns, if
the PME or SMI enable bit (and other associated enable bits) are set and the battery voltage is below approximately
2.2V, then a corresponding event will be generated.
15.3      Synchronization with the EC
The EC maintains the internal battery-back status bits that are used to configure the Low_Bat status bits in the PME and
SMI status registers. This status bit retains its value across VTR power cycles, so that the EC and the Host can properly
service battery events even if VTR power goes down after a low voltage event but before the EC or the Host can react
to the event. In order to insure that the EC and the Host are in synch with respect to processing low voltage events, the
Host should inform the EC that it has processed the Low_Bat events in the PME and SMI status registers.

16.0      RUNTIME REGISTERS
16.1      Power, Clocks and Reset
16.1.1       RESET
This block is reset when nSYS_RST is asserted. The Force Disk Change Register is also reset on nSIO_RESET.
16.2      Interrupts
16.2.1       HOST INTERRUPTS
The PME_STS/PME_EN registers can assert the IO_PME# pin and thus can be used to generate a PME to the Host.
The SMI_STS/SMI_EN registers can assert the IO_SMI# pin and can be used to generate an SMI to the Host. The PME
can also be routed to a SERIRQ channel in the LPC Configuration block, as the first of the two interrupts from the Run-
time Register block (SELECT=0). The SMI can be routed to the SERIRQ as the second interrupt from the Runtime Reg-
ister block (SELECT=1).
The SMI event produces a standard active low on the serial IRQ stream, and active low on the open drain IO_SMI# pin.
The PME event also produces a standard active low on the serial IRQ stream, and active low on the open drain
IO_PME# pin.
Firmware can generate a PME or an SMI through three EVT event bits. The EMI generates the EM_EVT1 and
EM_EVT2 signals, and the Firmware Event Status Register/Firmware Event Enable Register pair generates the
FW_EVT3 signal. The three EVT signals are routed to both the PME generation logic (in PME_STS2 Register) and the
SMI generation logic (in SMI_STS1 Register).

FW_EVT1
This bit is set to 1 if any of the bits in the Firmware Event Status Register in the Runtime Register block is asserted and
enabled by the corresponding bit in the Firmware Event Enable Register.
Low_Bat
When VTR reaches the its operating threshold, Low_Bat is set to the value of the VBAT_POR bit in the battery-backed
internal status register. When VCC RESET is de-asserted, this bit is also set to 1 if the VBAT_Low bit in the battery-
backed internal status register is asserted and not modified otherwise. The low battery event will not normally be a PME
wakeup event because the Low_Bat Enable bit will be cleared on VTR POR, when Low_Bat is set. See Section 15.0,
"Low Battery Detection," on page 147 for more details on the battery monitoring logic.
Intrusion
This bit is a copy of INTRUSION in the Intruder Register and follows its behavior. If enabled, a PME is generated when
INTRUSION is high. INTRUSION in the Intruder Register must be cleared in order for this bit to be cleared.
16.3.5        PME_STS3 REGISTER
PME Wake Status 3 register. All bits are cleared by writing with a 1. Writes of a 0 to any bit have no effect.
For each GPIO monitored by this register, a PME is asserted if the GPIO pin value changes according to the Interrupt
Detection field in the Pin Control Register associated with the GPIO. PME events are only asserted if the Interrupt
Detection field is set to an edge-triggered events. If the field is set to a level-sensitive event, no PME will be generated
even if the pin matches the selected level.
   Note:      If the Interrupt Detection field for one of the GPIO pins monitored by this register is changed from no-edge-
              detection to edge-triggered interrupts while the pin is high, the status bit will be set. Host software should
              clear the GPIO status bit in this register whenever it reconfigures the Interrupt Detection field in the Pin
              Control Register for the GPIO, in order to avoid a spurious event.

Low_Bat
When VTR reaches the its operating threshold, Low_Bat is set to the value of the VBAT_POR bit in the battery-backed
internal status register. When VCC RESET is de-asserted, this bit is also set to 1 if the VBAT_Low bit in the battery-
backed internal status register is asserted and not modified otherwise.
In normal use, the low battery event is not a PME wakeup event because the Low_Bat Enable bit will be cleared on VTR
POR, when Low_Bat is set.
See Section 15.0, "Low Battery Detection," on page 147 for more details on the battery monitoring logic.
PINT
The parallel port interrupt defaults to ‘1b’ when the parallel port activate bit is cleared. When the parallel port is activated,
PINT follows the ACK# input.
U2INT
This bit follows the interrupt bit from UART 2.
UINT1
This bit follows the interrupt bit from UART 1.
FINT
This bit follows the interrupt bit from Floppy Disk Controller.
EM_EVT1
This bit is set to 1 if the EC_WR bit (bit 0) of the Interrupt Source Register in the EM Interface is asserted.
EM_EVT2
This bit is set to 1 if any of the 16 bits in the Interrupt Source Register in the EM Interface is asserted and enabled by
the corresponding bit in the Interrupt Enable Register in the EM Interface.
FW_EVT1
This bit is set to 1 if any of the bits in the Firmware Event Status Register in the Runtime Register block is asserted and
enabled by the corresponding bit in the Firmware Event Enable Register.
16.3.12       SMI_STS2 REGISTER

MINT
This bit follows the interrupt bit from Mouse port of the 8042 Logical Device.
KINT
This bit follows the interrupt bit from Keyboard port of the 8042 Logical Device.
WDT
This bit is set to 1 if a Watchdog Timer event is asserted when the watchdog times out.
This bit is cleared by a write of ‘1b’. Writes of ‘0b’ have no effect.
Intrusion
This bit is a copy of INTRUSION in the Intruder Register and follows its behavior. If enabled, an SMI is generated when
INTRUSION is high. INTRUSION in the Intruder Register must be cleared in order for this bit to be cleared.
   Note 16-2       This bit is reserved. Writes are ignored. Reads always return ‘1’.
16.3.13       SMI_STS3 REGISTER
SMI Status 3 register. All bits are cleared by writing with a 1. Writes of a 0 to any bit have no effect.
For each GPIO monitored by this register, a SMI is asserted if the GPIO pin value changes according to the Interrupt
Detection field in the Pin Control Register associated with the GPIO. SMI events are only asserted if the Interrupt Detec-
tion field is set to an edge-triggered events. If the field is set to a level-sensitive event, no SMI will be generated even if
the pin matches the selected level.
   Note:      If the Interrupt Detection field for one of the GPIO pins monitored by this register is changed from no-edge-
              detection to edge-triggered interrupts while the pin is high, the status bit will be set. Host software should
              clear the GPIO status bit in this register whenever it reconfigures the Interrupt Detection field in the Pin
              Control Register for the GPIO, in order to avoid a spurious event.

INTRUSION
When the INTRUDER# input goes high-to-low or low-to-high, this bit will be set. This bit is also set on VBAT POR. Soft-
ware must write a ‘1’ to clear this bit. Writes of ‘0’ to this bit are ignored.

This bit indicates the current state of the INTRUDER# pin.
0: INTRUDER# pin is 0
1: INTRUDER# pin is 1
   Note 16-3     The VTR POR default value of this register depends on the current value of INTRD_STS, which is
                 derived directly from the INTRUDER# pin, and the VBAT-backed INTRUSION state bit. Possible
                 combinations are:

17.0       INTRUDER DETECTION SUPPORT
A switch connected to the chassis cover indicates if the cover is on or off. When the cover is removed, the INTRUDER#
input will transition from high-to-low or low-to-high depending on the type of switch used (normally open or normally
closed).
Whenever the INTRUDER# input goes high-to-low or low-to-high, the INTRUSION bit is set in the Intruder Register in
the Runtime Registers LPC Logical Device (Logical Device Ah). The INTRUSION bit will remain set until cleared by soft-
ware. This bit and input logic are powered by VBAT so that an intrusion condition is detected and stored even if VTR is
removed. The INTRD_STS bit indicates the current state of the INTRUDER# pin. This bit is in the Intruder Register in
the Runtime Registers LPC Logical Device (Logical Device Ah).
17.1       Intrusion Bit
An intrusion event occurs when there is any transition of INTRUDER# (low-to-high or high-to-low). Any intrusion event
will set the INTRUSION bit and also changes the PME and SMI status bits.
For minimal current drain on the battery, the recommended use of this pin is with a normally open switch as shown in
Figure 17-1, "Recommended Intruder Pin Connection". When the cover is closed the input will be externally pulled down
to ground. When the cover is opened this input will be pulled up to VBAT.

The INTRUSION bit will default to ‘1’ on VBAT POR (battery removed and replaced or battery voltage below approxi-
mately 1.2V on VTR POR). The INTRUSION bit will therefore be set to ‘1’ if an intrusion event occurs or if a VBAT POR
occurs.
Writing ‘1’ to the INTRUSION bit will clear it, regardless of the state of the INTRUDER# pin. Writing ‘0’ to the INTRUSION
bit has no effect.

17.2       PME and SMI Generation
The SMI and PME status bits for intrusion detection are set under VCC power, VTR power or on VTR POR, as they
“shadow” the INTRUDER# bit. The SMI and PME status bits are cleared on a write of '1'. These bits cannot be cleared
until the INTRUDER# pin goes low.
These bits function in one of three cases:
Case 1. An intrusion occurs under battery power only or a VBAT POR occurs. In this case, the event will be latched
under battery power and the INTRUSION PME and SMI status bits will be set when VTR returns. Therefore, the PME
and SMI status bits will have two possible default values on VTR POR, depending on whether or not the intrusion event
occurred under battery power. When VTR returns, no enable bits are set, so there will be no PME or SMI generated.
When VCC goes active, and the OS sets the enable bits, a PME and/or SMI will be generated. If the corresponding PME
enable bit is set, a PME will be generated under VCC power. If the corresponding SMI enable bit is set, an SMI will be
generated under VCC power. Therefore, in this case, setting the enable bit (low-to-high edge) will trigger the generation
of the PME and SMI.
Case 2. An intrusion occurs under VTR power (VCC=0). In this case, the INTRUSION PME and SMI status bits will be
set. If the corresponding PME enable bit is set, a PME will be generated under VTR power. If the corresponding SMI
enable bit is set, an SMI will be generated under VTR power. In this case, setting the status bit (low-to-high edge) will
trigger the generation of the PME and SMI.
Case 3. An intrusion occurs under VCC power. In this case, the INTRUSION PME and SMI status bits will be set. If the
corresponding PME enable bit is set, a PME will be generated under VCC power. If the corresponding SMI enable bit
is set, an SMI will be generated under VCC power. In this case, setting the status bit (low-to-high edge) will trigger the

18.0      GLUE LOGIC HARDWARE
18.1      General Description
The Glue Logic Hardware provides several special purpose hardware blocks. These blocks include functions for:
•  LRESET# buffering
•  Power Supply Turn On
•  PWR_GOOD_3V Signal
•  Resume Reset Signal Generation
•  Backfeed Cut Functionality
•  LED Pins
18.2      Power, Clocks and Reset
18.2.1       RESET
Glue logic is reset when nSYS_RST is asserted.
18.3      LRESET# buffering
The LRESET# input (Pin 16) can be used as an alternate function for a number of GPIO pins. When the LRESET# alter-
nate function is selected, the GPIO pin follows the state of the LRESET# pin, and thus functions as a buffered copy of
LRESET#.
The PCIRST_OUT4#, PCIRST_OUT3#, PCIRST_OUT2# and PCIRST_OUT1#functions are each associated with an
enable bit in the Power Good Register located in Runtime Register offset 05h. The bits are VTR powered bit, and default
to enabled (‘1’) on VTR POR. The bits operate as follows when the pins are configured for the LRESET# buffer function:
• When the associated enable bit is set to ‘1’, the pins will operate as in Table 18-1.
• When the associated enable bit is cleared to ‘0’, the pins will be low (‘0’).

When VTR power is applied, and VCC RESET is asserted, the buffered LRESET# outputs are low.
The timing values for the PCIRST_OUT4#, PCIRST_OUT3#, PCIRST_OUT2# and PCIRST_OUT1# signals are shown
in Table 18-2, "Buffered LRESET# Timing". This values reference Figure 18-1.

18.4       Power Supply Turn On
The PS_ON# signal is used to turn on the power supply. It is a function of SLP_S3# according to the truth table below.
The PS_ON# is used as the power down signal for the power supply. Since PS_ON# is an open drain output, it will need
to be pulled up external to the chip if such a pull-up is not provided on the power supply. The power supply turn-on circuit
behaves according to the table below.

18.5       PWR_GOOD_3V Signal
The PWR_GOOD_3V signal has a selectable delay to insert delay from ACPI power sequencing events to software run-
time.
• Negative edge (S0->S3/S5): The 1-0 transition of SLP_S3# input or the 1-0 transition (or 0 level) of PWRG-
   D_PS input would cause an immediate 1-0 transition (or 0 level) of PWR_GOOD_3V.
• Positive edge (S3/S5->S0): The 0-1 transition of PWRGD_PS input would cause a 0-1 transition of PWRGD_3V.
   The PWR_GOOD_3V transition is either immediate (no delay) or after a 100 ms (min) to 120 msec (max) delay
   from the 0-1 transition of PWRGD_PS.
• The delay is optional and will be governed by a lockable select bit in the PWRGD DELAY register (Runtime Regis-
   ter at offset 51h). Default operation selects the delay. An internal delay indicator signal is used to indicate whether
   the 100-120 msec delay time has elapsed.
• All affected pins will retain the same electrical characteristics as they have now.
• PWR_GOOD_3V is forced to 0 and glitch-protected while VTR is rising.
• PWR_GOOD_3V is always 0 when the Resume Reset signal is asserted.

                                         Delay is from 100 msec (min) to 120 msec (max) from the

18.5.1        BITS FOR SELECTING AND LOCKING DELAY
Bits[1:0] in the Power Good Register at offset 27h of the Runtime Registers are used for selecting and locking the delay.
The select bit (Bit[0]) selects the delay option as shown in Table 18-4. The LOCK bit (Bit[1]) sets bits[1:0] to be Read
Only. These bits remain RO until a VTR POR.
18.6       Resume Reset Signal Generation
The RSMRST# signal is the reset output for the resume well power supply. This signal is used as a power on reset signal
for the ICH.
RSMRST# is asserted by hardware and is also asserted and de-asserted by firmware. Hardware will not de-assert
RSMRST#. EC Firmware controls the output level of RSMRST#. RSMRST# is forced to 0 and glitch-protected while
VTR is rising.
The timing for the resume reset signal is given in Figure 18-3 and Table 18-5. The rising edge of RSMRST# is a delayed
3.3V buffered copy of VTR. This delay, tRESET_DELAY, starts when VTR hits the trip point, VTRIP. and is dependent on
internal firmware. The delay is not programmable. Note the RSMRST# will be inactive high after the tRESET_DELAY only
if VTR (3.3V) is present. Otherwise, RSMRST# will be active low beyond the tRESET_DELAY – until VTR (3.3V) goes
active. On the falling edge there is minimal delay, tRESET_FALL. Note that VTRIP shown in Figure 18-3 has a VTRIP_MIN
and a VTRIP_MAX.

BACKFEED_CUT# is a signal required by the S3 power state circuitry and is powered by the VTR supply. It is a function
of PWRGD_PS and SLP_S3# according to Table 18-6, "BACKFEED_CUT# Truth Table". BACKFEED_CUT# is used
to switch between the main voltage regulator and the suspend voltage regulator for various sub-systems when the sys-
tem is transitioning into the S3 power state.

The LATCHED_BF_CUT is generated from BACKFEED_CUT# and SLP_S5#. It is powered by VTR. As shown in
Table 18-7, "LATCHED_BF_CUT Truth Table", LATCHED_BF_CUT is unconditionally low if either SLP_S5# or BACK-
FEED_CUT# is low. LATCHED_BF_CUT will only go high on the rising edge of BACKFEED_CUT# if SLP_S5# is
already high. Once high, LATCHED_BF_CUT goes low as soon as SLP_S5# or BACKFEED_CUT# goes low.

   Note 18-2     This is the condition when BACKFEED_CUT# stays high and SLP_S5# goes low and then high again
                 (see Figure 18-4).
APPLICATION NOTE: The figure below shows the power up sequence. The BACKFEED_CUT# signal follows the
                           power rail up to its final value. The LATCHED_BF_CUT signal stays low and never turns on.
                           The SLP_S5# goes to its high value when the power rails have stabilized, approximately
                           25msec after power on.BACKEED_CUT# is pulled low a period t1 after SLP_S5# goes high.
                           The period t1 can be as short as 1msec. Typical measured values are approximately

APPLICATION NOTE: There are two possible timing sequences following the power up signal sequencing. The first
                      possible sequence is with SLP_S5# staying high and BACKFEED_CUT# transitioning from
                      low to high, remaining high for an undetermined period and then going back to low. At this
                      point, the system returns to the end of the power-up sequence. During these
                      BACKFEED_CUT# transitions, the propagation delays, rise and fall times for
                      LATCHED_BF_CUT are as described in the figure below. The first sequence can start at the
                      end of the power-up sequence at any time.

APPLICATION NOTE: The second possible sequence, shown in the figure below, is a normal powerdown
                      sequence. The BACKFEED_CUT# signal goes from low to high when SLP_S3# goes low,
                      and SLP_S5# goes from high to low 30usec to 65usec (t3) later. The LATCHED_BF_CUT
                      signal goes high when BACKFEED_CUT# goes high and then LATCHED_BF_CUT returns

                          to low when SLP_S5# goes low. The BACKFEED_CUT# stays high and SLP_S5# stays low
                          for an indeterminate time and then SLP_S5# will go high. A minimum of 1msec (t4) later,
                          BACKFEED_CUT# will go low and the system returns to the end of the power-up sequence
                          when SLP_S3# and PWRGD_3V goes high. Typical measured values of t4 are
                          approximately 250msec. During all transitions, the propagation delays, rise and fall times and
                          power regulation times for LATCHED_BF_CUT are as described in Figure 18-7. The first
                          sequence can start at the end of this power-up sequence at any time.

The LED1#/GP006 and LED2#/GP007 functions on pin 25 and pin 26 can be used to control two LEDs or a Bi-Color
LED. These pins default to LED functions with inverted, open-drain outputs (active low). The GPIO Configuration reg-
isters for GP006 and GP007 will have default values of inverted outputs on VTR POR. The LED pins can be configured
to control a single bi-color LED or separate LEDs.
When connected to a Bi-Color LED, the two LED pins can configure the LED to be on or blinking in either of two colors.
In this section, the colors will be called Color1 and Color2.
The LED pin functions control the LED as follows:
• The LED1# pin is low/blinking, the LED2# pin is high: LED is on/blinking, Color1.
• The LED2# pin is low/blinking, the LED1# pin is high: LED is on/blinking, Color2.
• Both the LED1# and LED2# pins are high: LED is off.

The SLP_S5#, SLP_S3#, PWRGD_PS pins and the Code-Fetch Bit are inputs to the LED logic circuit. The conditions
for different LED1# and LED2# state outputs are described below. Depending on the conditions below, the LED1# and
LED2# pins will be either steady ON, OFF or will Blink at 1Hz with 50% duty cycle (500ms on, 500ms off). The LED logic
circuit controls the state of the LEDs by controlling bits[3:0] in the LED Register in the Runtime Register Logical Device.
In addition, under certain conditions software can write these bits to control the LEDs. The ON, OFF and Blink selection
is done via Bits[1:0] in the LED Register. The Color of the LEDs are programmable via Bits[3:2] of the LED Register.
See Table 18-12 on page 180.
The LED Register is only writable when the system is the fully on state (the fully on state occurs in the S0 state with the
PWRGD_PS signal active high). Writing the LED Register in other states may result in indeterminate results. Table 18-
11 summarizes the Bi-Color LED functionality. Bits[2:0] of the LED register are controlled by the LED state machine
when in the S3 state, in the S0 state when PWRGD_PS is low, and on transitions of S5 and PWRGD_PS. In other states,
Bits[2:0] are set by software writing the LED register.

SCH5627P
19.0      GPIO INTERFACE
19.1      General Description
The SCH5627P GPIO Interface provides general purpose input monitoring and output control, as well as managing
many aspects of pin functionality; including, multi-function Pin Multiplexing Control, Output Buffer Type control, PU/PD
resistors, asynchronous wakeup and synchronous Interrupt Detection, GPIO Direction, and Polarity control.
Features of the GPIO Interface include:
• Inputs:
  - Asynchronous rising and falling edge wakeup detection
  - Interrupt High or Low Level
• On Output:
  - Push Pull or Open Drain output
• Pull up or pull down resistor control
• Interrupt and wake capability available for all GPIOs
• 8 Registers
• Group- or individual control of GPIO data.
• Multiplexing of all multi-function pins are controlled by the GPIO interface
19.2      GPIO Indexing
Each GPIO signal function name consists of a 2-character prefix (“GP”) followed by a 3-digit octal-encoded index
number. In the SCH5627P GPIO indexing is done sequentially starting from ‘GP000.’
19.3      Pin Multiplexing Control
Pin multiplexing depends upon the Mux Control bits in the Pin Control Register. There is a Pin Control Register for
each GPIO signal function.
Table 19-1 shows all of the functions on each pin. Default function is assigned on nWDT_RST., except for pins 120 and
121, as described by Note 19-1. The default function is Function 0 unless otherwise noted.

   Note 19-3    The only field that can be modified in the pin control register for GP067, the register located at offset
                0DCh, is the Interrupt Detection field. Other fields, such as the Mux Control and GPIO Direction, are
                fixed at their default values.
   Note 19-4    The Pin Control registers for GP063 and GP064 are only reset on nSYS_RST. All other GPIO Pin
                Control registers are reset on nWDT_RST.
The Pin Control Register format is illustrated in Table 19-4 below and described in the subsections that follow. Pin Con-
trol Register address offsets and defaults are defined in Section 19.2, "GPIO Indexing," on page 182.

   Note 19-5      Only edge triggered interrupts can wake up the main ring oscillator. The GPIO must be configured
                  for edge-triggered interrupts (Interrupt Detection set to 101b - 111b), edge-triggered interrupts must
                  be enabled (Edge Enable set to 1b) and the GPIO interrupt must be enabled in the interrupt
                  aggregator in order to wake up the ring when the ring is shut down.
Edge Enable
When this bit is ‘1’, the GPIO has edge detection enabled. When this bit is ‘0’, edge detection is disabled.
When this bit is ‘0’, the ring oscillator wakeup function is disabled. In order to put the pin in its lowest power state, the
Edge Enable bit should be set to ‘0’, and the Interrupt Detection field set to one of the edge triggered values (101b -
111b). This combination ensures that no interrupt will be generated and that no wakeup function will be enabled.

   Note 19-6      Unless explicitly stated otherwise, pins with (I/O/OD) or (O/OD) in their buffer type column in the
                  tables in Section TABLE 3-1:, "Signal Descriptions," on page 11 are compliant with the following
                  Programmable OD/PP Multiplexing Design Rule: Each compliant pin has a programmable open
                  drain/push-pull buffer controlled by the Output Buffer Type bit in the associated Pin Control
                  Register. The state of this bit controls the mode of the interface buffer for all selected functions,
                  including the GPIO function.
GPIO Direction
The GPIO Direction bit controls the buffer direction only when the Mux Control field is ‘00’ selecting the pin signal func-
tion to be GPIO. When the Mux Control field is greater than ‘00’ (i.e., a non-GPIO signal function is selected) the GPIO
Direction bit has no affect and the selected signal function logic directly controls the pin direction.

Polarity
When the Polarity bit is set to ‘1’ and the Mux Control bits are greater than ‘00,’ the selected signal function outputs are
inverted and Interrupt Detection sense defined in Table 19-6, "Interrupt Detection Bits Definition" is inverted. When the
Mux Control field selects the GPIO signal function (Mux = ‘00’), the Polarity bit does not effect the output. Regardless
of the state of the Mux Control field and the Polarity bit, the state of the pin is always reported without inversion in the
GPIO input register.

20.0      JTAG AND XNOR
20.1      General Description
This sections describes functions for debug and test. The SCH5627P includes a. JTAG port for testing and debugging.
The XNOR Chain for board test is also included in this section.
20.2      JTAG Port Signal Interface Description
The signal pins are defined in Table 3-1, “Signal Descriptions,” on page 11.
The TCK input is the clock that drives the JTAG interface. It is asynchronous to other clocks on-chip.
The TMS input is sampled on each rising edge of JTAG_CLK, and governs the transitions among the 16 states of the
state machine (TAP) that controls the transfer of data.
The TDI input is the serial data input, shifted in during the Shift-IR and Shift-DR states of the TAP. It is sampled on rising
edges of JTAG_CLK.
The TDO output is the serial data output. It is presented on falling edges of JTAG_CLK, 1/2 clock before each input shift,
to provide setup and hold time to the next JTAG controller in the chain. The final TDO output pin, after all on-chip chain-
ing is held in high-impedance mode (floating) except when valid data is being presented. The enabled/disabled state of
the pin is also changed on falling edges of JTAG_CLK.
The TRST# input is provides the Async JTAG RESET. Note that the reset state of the JTAG port is only local to the
JTAG port: its effect is to keep the JTAG port in an idle state and to disengage it from the rest of the system, so that it
does not affect other on-chip logic in this state.
20.3      Power, Clocks and Reset
See Section 22.14, "JTAG Interface Timing," on page 225 power on sequence and reset timing.
20.3.1       POWER DOMAINS
The JTAG block is powered by VTR.
20.3.2       CLOCKS
The JTAG port runs internally from the externally-provided JTAG_CLK clock pulses only. There is no requirement for
JTAG_CLK to be constantly running.
20.3.3       RESET
The ARC JTAG block has two resets: Async JTAG RESET by its TRST# input and Sync JTAG RESET by JTAG protocol.
20.3.3.1       Async JTAG RESET
The TRST# pin provides the Async JTAG RESET to the JTAG Registers. The TRST# pin has an active low, asynchro-
nous assertion and a synchronous de-assertion. The JTAG Registers will be reset asynchronously (and immediately)
upon the active low TRST# assertion. Once the TRST# pin has been de-asserted, a delay of three JTAG_CLK’s is
required in order to access the JTAG Registers. The JTAG Registers will remain in reset until the three clocks complete
the synchronous TRST# pin de-assertion. See Section 22.14, "JTAG Interface Timing," on page 225.
APPLICATION NOTE: After asserting and de-asserted the TRST# pin, a Sync JTAG RESET can be applied before
                           starting to access the JTAG Registers (to meet the TRST# synchronous de-assertion
                           requirement.
JTAG registers, in particular the JTAG Test Mode Data Registers, are set to their initial values by the assertion of the
TRST# pin, not the VTR Power On Reset. TRST# must be held low while the SCH5627P is powering up so the registers
can be set to their proper default values. If TRST# is high during power up, the JTAG Test Mode Data Registers may
be set to unpredictable values, which may trigger unwanted test modes.
Care should be taken during VTR power up to insure that TRST# is asserted for a longer time then the VTR rise time
due to capacitive loading.

20.3.3.2                  Sync JTAG RESET
It can also be reset synchronously by a JTAG_CLK / TMS sequence, in accordance with the JTAG standard. A series
of 5 successive JTAG_CLK rising edges, with TMS held high throughout, will accomplish this from any state.
The ARC JTAG port, upon entering its Reset state, will be prepared to accept an Instruction or Data transfer. It will also
be disengaged from external circuitry, allowing it to operate normally.
The initial contents of the Instruction Register are the IDCODE command (Ch). If a Data transfer is performed first after
Reset, without an preceding Instruction transfer, then the IDCODE value will be loaded into its 32-bit shift register and
presented serially, after which will appear the bits shifted in from TDI.
The initial contents of the Data registers are as listed in Table 20-1, “JTAG Instruction Register Encodings,” on page 196.
20.4              JTAG Background
The following is a simplified description, intended to provide background for the ARC JTAG port. For full details, see the
JTAG specification (IEEE Standards 1149.1 and 1149.1b).
20.4.1                  INTERNAL STRUCTURE
A JTAG port operates by transferring information serially into and out of an Instruction register and one or more Data
registers. These registers are connected in parallel with each other, and can be of arbitrary length. See Figure 20-1.

                                                                                                   SCH5627P
The protocol for shifting information makes a distinction between an Instruction transfer (to/from a single Instruction reg-
ister) and a Data transfer (to/from one of several Data registers). The Instruction register is handled separately because
it selects which specific Data register is accessed by subsequent Data transfers.
In daisy-chained JTAG controllers, the Instruction registers form one chain, and the currently-selected set of Data reg-
isters in each JTAG controller combine to form a second chain. To shorten the Data chain when not all JTAG controllers
are of interest, a mandatory one-bit Data register called BYPASS is provided. There is no bypassing for the Instruction
chain, so its full length must be shifted as each new instruction is transferred anywhere. Selecting the BYPASS Data
register is the equivalent of a No-Operation instruction for a JTAG controller, and this instruction is always defined as a
‘1’ in all Instruction register bits.
Each entity called a “Register” actually consists of two parts: the Register itself, and an associated Shift Register which
connects to TDI and TDO. The Register may load from, and/or source information in parallel to, the Shift Register. These
two parts are the same length, meaning that (for example) a 5-bit Register will be associated with a 5-bit Shift Register.
The Instruction register and the Data registers respond to decoded state signals from the TAP Controller sub-block
(Section 20.4.2), which represent sub-steps of a transfer. The sub-steps they perform are Capture, which loads the shift
register in parallel, Shift, which shifts information in from TDI and out on TDO, and Update, which writes information
from the Shift Register in parallel. The Capture-IR, Shift-IR and Update-IR controls affect only the Instruction register.
The Capture-DR, Shift-DR and Update-DR controls affect only the Data register that is currently selected by the con-
tents of the Instruction register.
20.4.2         TAP CONTROLLER AND PROTOCOL
The JTAG protocol is driven by the level of the TMS (Test Mode Select) input pin at each rising edge of the JTAG_CLK
clock. This is the responsibility of the TAP Controller section of the JTAG controller, which performs state transitions as
illustrated in the state diagram in Figure 20-2. States whose names end with “IR” affect the Instruction register (the right-
most column of states in Figure 20-2), and those ending with “DR” affect a Data register (the middle column in Figure 20-
2). Note that the TMS signal goes in parallel to all JTAG ports in a chain, so they are always in the same protocol state.
The sequence of accessing any register is as follows:
• Capture (IR or DR), which loads a shift register from its source in preparation for shifting it out. In the case of the
    Instruction register, this is a fixed value, and not the previous contents of the Instruction register. In the case of the
    BYPASS Data register, this is a fixed ‘0’ value. The Capture state is transitory, being present for only one JTAG_-
    CLK cycle, once per transfer.
• Shift (IR or DR), which shifts the Captured information in the Shift Register out on the TDO pin while also shifting
    information in from the TDI pin. The registers (by convention) shift from left to right, so the least-significant bit of a
    value is transferred first. This state may be held arbitrarily (holding TMS=0) to shift as many bits as desired.
• Update (IR or DR), which loads a Register from its Shift Register after the shifting has completed. The Update
    state is transitory, being present for only one JTAG_CLK cycle, once per transfer.
There is also a Pause state (IR or DR) which may be used to exit and re-enter the Shift state without terminating the
transfer in progress. This state may be held (TMS=0) in order to delay for any desired number of JTAG_CLK cycles.
Outside of Instruction or Data transfers, there are two states which may be entered and held. These are shown in the
leftmost column in Figure 20-2.
• The Test-Logic-Reset state holds the JTAG logic in its reset state. This re-initializes the registers that are internal
    to the JTAG logic. This state is entered asynchronously by assertion of TRST# low, and it can be seen in
    Figure 20-2 that, from any other state, this state will be entered by 5 successive JTAG_CLK cycles with TMS held
    to ‘1’.
• Run-Test/Idle holds JTAG logic idle, but not reset, between transfers.

20.4.3        INTERFACE TIMING EXAMPLE
Figure 20-3 illustrates the timing relationship between data shifting and the TAP Controller’s Shift states, using a 1-bit
Data register as an example. (This is in fact the exact situation when the BYPASS Data register is selected: refer to
FIGURE 20-1: on page 192.)
The TAP Controller changes states on each rising edge of JTAG_CLK, traversing the state table in Figure 20-2 as
directed by the TMS input signal from the external interface.
Previous to the waveform in Figure 20-3, the TAP Controller has already passed through a Capture-DR state, so the 1-
bit Shift Register has been pre-loaded with a “Capture Value”, either from its associated parallel Register or from another
source. (For the BYPASS register, this would be a fixed ‘0’.)
At the first rising edge of JTAG_CLK in Figure 20-3, the Shift-DR state is being entered. As yet, no valid data needs to
be present on TDI or TDO.
At the first falling edge of JTAG_CLK, while the Shift-DR state is active, the TDO pin begins presenting the least-signif-
icant bit of the Shift Register (the only bit, in this example), which is holding the Captured Value. At about this time also,
the external interface will drive TDI to the desired new state for this Data register.

At the next rising edge of JTAG_CLK, the Shift-DR state is exited, and that same clock edge is used to actually perform
the commanded shift. The TDI value “A” is shifted into the Shift Register. This same rising edge of JTAG_CLK is used
by the external interface to shift in the Captured Value from TDO. The TDO output does not change yet, because it is
held by a 1/2 clock delay stage (see FIGURE 20-1: on page 192), providing hold time for the external interface.
On the next falling edge, the TDO output changes. Since the Shift state is no longer present, TDO is not required at this
time to present valid data, and in fact for an off-chip connection it is required to float at this time.
After this timing diagram completes, the TAP machine will continue to an Update-DR state, at which time the value A,
now present in the Shift Register, will be written to its destination. (In the specific case of the BYPASS register, there is
no destination, and that step will do nothing.)

The Instruction Register is four bits wide. It selects among the implemented Data Registers as listed in Table 20-1. When
the Tap Controller is placed into the Test-Logic-Reset state, the Instruction register is initialized to Ch, selecting the
IDCODE Data Register.
Registers marked as MCHP reserved must not be modified. Modifications may lead to unpredictable and unwanted
behavior.

20.5.2.2       BYPASS Register (Fh)
The BYPASS register consists only of a 1-bit shift register cell. The Capture-DR state clears it to ‘0’ when selected. The
Update-DR state does nothing.
The function of this register is to provide the minimum amount of delay (one bit of ‘0’) when other JTAG ports on the
chain are being exercised.

SCH5627P
VTR POR
Asserts VTR Power On Reset: When the VTR POR active low bit is asserted ‘0’ while the field POR EN in this register
is ‘1’, forces a VTR Power On Reset. When the VTR POR active low bit de-asserted ‘1’, the VCC POR circuitry returns
to its normal state.
POR EN
Power On Reset Enable. When ‘1’, the reset functions controlled by VCC RESET and VTR POR are enabled. When ‘0’,
the VCC RESET and VTR POR fields in this register have no effect on the POR circuitry.
TEST
All TEST bits should be set to ‘0’ when writing this register.

If this bit is ‘1b’, the reset going to the ARC processor and select peripherals is reduced from its nominal 20ms duration.
If this bit is ‘0b’, the ARC reset is stretched by the nominal delay.
Test_XNOR_En
If this bit is ‘1b’, the Device-Under-Test XNOR chain test mode is enabled. If this bit is ‘0b’, the XNOR mode is disabled.
See Section 41.12, “XNOR Chain,” on page 682.
    Note:       Once the XNOR chain is enabled, a power cycle is required to re-establish JTAG operation.

20.6       JTAG Standard Port Discovery
This section provides information that is not unique to ARC, but is part of the JTAG standard, and is provided for infor-
mation.
The Discovery process will identify each JTAG controller that has an IDCODE register. Part of what needs to be derived
is the length of the Instruction register in each of the JTAG ports. If this cannot be derived from the IDCODE values, or
if some JTAG ports do not have an IDCODE register, then the missing lengths must be provided by other means.
In the Test-Logic-Reset state, a JTAG port is required to initialize its Instruction register to select the IDCODE Data reg-
ister if present, or if it is not present, then to select the BYPASS Data register.
The IDCODE Data register:
•  Must be exactly 32 bits in length
•  Must have ‘1’ in its first (least-significant) bit
•  Must not have the pattern 000011111111 (FFh) in its first (least-significant) 12 bits.
•  Will contain a completely definitive port identification, because 11 bits of it are a Manufacturer ID number assigned
   by the JEDEC standards organization.
A BYPASS Data register access will initialize its 1-bit shift register to ‘0’ at the Capture-DR state, effectively making the
BYPASS register appear to be 1-bit read-only ‘0’.
Discovery, therefore, consists of the external JTAG host doing the following:
• Place the chain of JTAG controllers into the Test-Logic-Reset state.
• Do a Data register access, without an Instruction register access first.
   - This Data access will shift in 8 bits of ones, followed by all zeroes for the duration of the discovery phase.
• While shifting, examine the data appearing on TDO for IDCODE values.
   - A ‘0’ indicates a JTAG port that has no IDCODE register. Collect only this bit, and note that the JTAG port
      exists. Start looking for an IDCODE value at the next bit.
   - A ‘1’ indicates that an IDCODE register is coming. Collect this bit and the next 31 bits to identify the JTAG
      port. If, however, the value seen is 00h0000FF, then this is maintained to be the value provided originally on
      TDI, and indicates the end of the chain.
20.7       XNOR Chain
20.7.1         OVERVIEW
The XNOR Chain test mode allows users to confirm that all SCH5627P pins are in contact with the motherboard during
assembly and test operations. The XNOR Chain test mode is enabled and disabled through the JTAG interface, using
bit Test_XNOR_En in JTAG TEST REGISTER 4 / Reset Register (Dh).
An example of an XNOR Chain test structure is illustrated below in Figure 20-4. When the XNOR Chain test mode is
enabled all pins except for the Excluded Pins shown in Section 20.7.2 are disconnected from their internal functions and
forced as inputs to the XNOR Chain. This allows a single input pin to toggle the XNOR Chain output if all other input
pins are held high or low. The XNOR Chain output is the GP031 pin.
The tests that are performed when the XNOR Chain test mode is enabled require the board-level test hardware to con-
trol the device pins and observe the results at the XNOR Chain output pin; e.g., as described in Section 20.7.3, "Test
Procedure," on page 200.
20.7.2         EXCLUDED PINS
The following pins are XNOR Chain Excluded Pins:
• POWER PLANE pins, VR_CAP, PECI VREF
• TRST#.
• Analog pins: REMOTE1-, REMOTE1+, REMOTE2-, REMOTE2+, V_IN

20.7.3      TEST PROCEDURE
20.7.3.1       Setup
1.  Connect the VSS and AGND pins to ground.
2.  Connect the VCC0, VCC1, and VCC2 pins to an unpowered 3.3V power source.
3.  Connect an oscilloscope or voltmeter to the GP031 pin.
4.  All other pins should be tied to ground.
Warning: Ensure power supply is off during Setup.
20.7.3.2       Testing
1.  Turn on the 3.3V power source.
2.  Enable the XNOR Chain through the JTAG interface (Test_XNOR_En in JTAG TEST REGISTER 4 / Reset Reg-
    ister (Dh)). Note that at this point all inputs to the XNOR Chain are low and the output on the GP031 pin is high
    (refer to the Initial Configuration row in Table 20-6, "Toggling Inputs in Descending Pin Order").
3.  Bring the highest numbered pin (N) high, where N is the number of pins to be tested as described in Note 20-
    1. The output on the GP031 pin should toggle (refer to Step 1 in Table 20-6.
4.  In descending pin order successively bring each input high. As shown in Table 20-6 the GP031 pin toggles after
    each step. Continue until all inputs are high. The output on the GP031 pin is high (refer to the Final Configu-
    ration in Table 20-6).
5.  The current state of the chip is now represented by the Initial Configuration row in Table 20-7, "Toggling Inputs in
    Ascending Pin Order".
6.  Each input should now be brought low, starting at pin one (Step N+1) and continuing in ascending pin order until
    all inputs are low. The output on the GP031 pin is high (refer to the Final Configuration in Table 20-7.
7.  Exit the XNOR Chain Test Mode by cycling VTR power.

   Note 21-4    The nature of the ADC implies that the Full Scale voltage is equal to VREF - 1 LSB or, VREF * 2047
                / 2048.
   Note 21-5    The Capacitive Load will be dependent on the beta of the transistor being measured. The given
                value is for a beta greater or equal to 0.4. If the beta is less than 0.4, then the supported value is
                reduced. The current IP can support up to 10nF for a diode-connected transistor.

22.5.2        ECP PARALLEL PORT TIMING
Parallel Port FIFO (Mode 101)
The standard parallel port is run at or near the peak 500KBytes/sec allowed in the forward direction using DMA. The
state machine does not examine ACK# and begins the next transfer based on Busy. Refer to FIGURE 22-16: on
page 217.
ECP Parallel Port Timing
The timing is designed to allow operation at approximately 2.0 Mbytes/sec over a 15ft cable. If a shorter cable is used
then the bandwidth will increase.
Forward-Idle
When the host has no data to send it keeps HostClk (STROBE#) high and the peripheral will leave PeriphClk (Busy) low.
Forward Data Transfer Phase
The interface transfers data and commands from the host to the peripheral using an interlocked PeriphAck and HostClk.
The peripheral may indicate its desire to send data to the host by asserting nPeriphRequest.
The Forward Data Transfer Phase may be entered from the Forward-Idle Phase. While in the Forward Phase the periph-
eral may asynchronously assert the nPeriphRequest (nFault) to request that the channel be reversed. When the periph-
eral is not busy it sets PeriphAck (Busy) low. The host then sets HostClk (STROBE#) low when it is prepared to send
data. The data must be stable for the specified setup time prior to the falling edge of HostClk. The peripheral then sets
PeriphAck (Busy) high to acknowledge the handshake. The host then sets HostClk (STROBE#) high. The peripheral
then accepts the data and sets PeriphAck (Busy) low, completing the transfer. This sequence is shown in FIGURE 22-
17: on page 217.
The timing is designed to provide 3 cable round-trip times for data setup if Data is driven simultaneously with HostClk
(STROBE#).
Reverse-Idle Phase
The peripheral has no data to send and keeps PeriphClk high. The host is idle and keeps HostAck low.
Reverse Data Transfer Phase
The interface transfers data and commands from the peripheral to the host using an interlocked HostAck and PeriphClk.
The Reverse Data Transfer Phase may be entered from the Reverse-Idle Phase. After the previous byte has been
accepted the host sets HostAck (ALF#) low. The peripheral then sets PeriphClk (ACK#) low when it has data to send.
The data must be stable for the specified setup time prior to the falling edge of PeriphClk. When the host is ready to
accept a byte it sets HostAck (ALF#) high to acknowledge the handshake. The peripheral then sets PeriphClk (ACK#)
high. After the host has accepted the data, it sets HostAck (ALF#) low, completing the transfer. This sequence is shown
in FIGURE 22-18: on page 218.
Output Drivers
To facilitate higher performance data transfer, the use of balanced CMOS active drivers for critical signals (Data,
HostAck, HostClk, PeriphAck, PeriphClk) are used in ECP Mode. Because the use of active drivers can present com-
patibility problems in Compatible Mode (the control signals, by tradition, are specified as open-drain), the drivers are
dynamically changed from open-drain to push-pull. The timing for the dynamic driver change is specified in the IEEE
1284 Extended Capabilities Port Protocol and ISA Interface Standard, Rev. 1.14, July 14, 1993, available from Microsoft.
The dynamic driver change must be implemented properly to prevent glitching the outputs.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.
•     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
      knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
      Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
      mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be super-
seded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO REP-
