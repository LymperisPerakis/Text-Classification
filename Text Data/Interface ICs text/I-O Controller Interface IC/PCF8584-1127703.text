1    FEATURES                                                  2    GENERAL DESCRIPTION
• Parallel-bus to I2C-bus protocol converter and interface     The PCF8584 is an integrated circuit designed in CMOS
• Compatible with most parallel-bus                            technology which serves as an interface between most
  microcontrollers/microprocessors including 8049, 8051,       standard parallel-bus microcontrollers/microprocessors
  6800, 68000 and Z80                                          and the serial I2C-bus. The PCF8584 provides both master
                                                               and slave functions.
• Both master and slave functions
                                                               Communication with the I2C-bus is carried out on a
• Automatic detection and adaption to bus interface type
                                                               byte-wise basis using interrupt or polled handshake.
• Programmable interrupt vector                                It controls all the I2C-bus specific sequences, protocol,
• Multi-master capability                                      arbitration and timing. The PCF8584 allows parallel-bus
• I2C-bus monitor mode                                         systems to communicate bidirectionally with the I2C-bus.
• Long-distance mode (4-wire)
• Operating supply voltage 4.5 to 5.5 V
• Operating temperature range: −40 to +85 °C.

The PCF8584 acts as an interface device between                     Selection of either an 80XX mode or 68000 mode
standard high-speed parallel buses and the serial I2C-bus.          interface is achieved by detection of the first WR-CS signal
On the I2C-bus, it can act either as master or slave.               sequence. The concept takes advantage of the fact that
Bidirectional data transfer between the I2C-bus and the             the write control input is common for both types of
parallel-bus microcontroller is carried out on a byte-wise          interfaces. An 80XX-type interface is default. If a
basis, using either an interrupt or polled handshake.               HIGH-to-LOW transition of WR (R/W) is detected while CS
Interface to either 80XX-type (e.g. 8048, 8051, Z80) or             is HIGH, the 68000-type interface mode is selected and
68000-type buses is possible. Selection of bus type is              the DTACK output is enabled. Care must be taken that WR
automatically performed (see Section 6.2).                          and CS are stable after reset.

S22, S23 and S24 are used for control of the internal clock
prescaler. Due to the possibility of varying microcontroller
clock signals, the prescaler can be programmed to adapt
to 5 different clock rates, thus providing a constant internal
clock. This is required to provide a stable time base for the
SCL generator and the digital filters associated with the
I2C-bus signals SCL and SDA. Selection for adaption to
external clock rates is shown in Table 3.

In receiver mode the data from the shift register is copied to the read buffer during the acknowledge phase. Further
reception of data is inhibited (SCL held LOW) until the S0 read buffer is read (see Section 6.8.1.1).
In the transmitter mode data is transmitted to the I2C-bus as soon as it is written to the S0 shift register if the serial I/O is
enabled (ESO = 1).
Remarks:
1. A minimum of 6 clock cycles must elapse between consecutive parallel-bus accesses to the PCF8584 when the
     I2C-bus controller operates at 8 or 12 MHz. This may be reduced to 3 clock cycles for lower operating frequencies.
2. To start a read operation immediately after a write, it is necessary to read the S0 read buffer in order to invoke
     reception of the first byte (‘dummy read’ of the address). Immediately after the acknowledgement, this first byte will
     be transferred from the shift register to the read buffer. The next read will then transfer the correct value of the first
     byte to the microcontroller bus (see Fig.7).
6.8        Control/status register S1
Register S1 controls I2C-bus operation and provides I2C-bus status information. Register S1 is accessed by a HIGH
signal on register select input A0. For more efficient communication between microcontroller/processor and the I2C-bus,
register S1 has separate read and write functions for all bit positions (see Fig.3). The write-only section provides register
access control and control over I2C-bus signals, while the read-only section provides I2C-bus status information.

6.8.1     REGISTER S1 CONTROL SECTION
The write-only section of S1 enables access to registers S0, S0', S1, S2 and S3, and controls I2C-bus operation; see
Table 4.
6.8.1.1      PIN (Pending Interrupt Not)
When the PIN bit is written with a logic 1, all status bits are reset to logic 0. This may serve as a software reset function
(see Figs 5 to 9). PIN is the only bit in S1 which may be both read and written to. PIN is mostly used as a status bit for
synchronizing serial communication, see Section 6.8.2.
6.8.1.2      ESO (Enable Serial Output)
ESO enables or disables the serial I2C-bus I/O. When ESO is LOW, register access for initialization is possible. When
ESO is HIGH, I2C-bus communication is enabled; communication with serial shift register S0 is enabled and the S1 bus
status bits are made available for reading.

Notes
1. With ESO = 0, bits ENI, STA, STO and ACK of S1 can be read for test purposes.
2. ‘X’ if ENI = 0.
6.8.1.3      ES1 and ES2
ES1 and ES2 control selection of other registers for initialization and control of normal operation. After these bits are
programmed for access to the desired register (shown in Table 5), the register is selected by a logic LOW level on
register select pin A0.
6.8.1.4      ENI
This bit enables the external interrupt output INT, which is generated when the PIN bit is active (logic 0).
This bit must be set to logic 0 before entering the long-distance mode, and remain at logic 0 during operation in
long-distance mode.

Notes
1. In master receiver mode, the last byte must be terminated with ACK bit HIGH (‘negative acknowledge’).
2. If both STA and STO are set HIGH simultaneously in master mode, a STOP condition followed by a START
    condition + address will be generated. This allows ‘chaining’ of transmissions without relinquishing bus control.
3. All other STA and STO mode combinations not mentioned in Table 7 are NOPs.
6.8.1.6      ACK
This bit must be set normally to a logic 1. This causes the I2C-bus controller to send an acknowledge automatically after
each byte (this occurs during the 9th clock pulse). The bit must be reset (to logic 0) when the I2C-bus controller is
operating in master/receiver mode and requires no further data to be sent from the slave transmitter. This causes a
negative acknowledge on the I2C-bus, which halts further transmission from the slave device.
6.8.2      REGISTER S1 STATUS SECTION
The read-only section of S1 enables access to I2C-bus status information; see Table 4.

10 HANDLING
Inputs and outputs are protected against electrostatic discharge in normal handling. However, to be totally safe, it is good
practice to take normal precautions appropriate to handling MOS devices (see “Handling MOS Devices” ).

Notes
1. A minimum of 6 clock cycles must elapse between consecutive parallel-bus accesses when the I2C-bus controller
     operates at 8 or 12 MHz. This may be reduced to 3 clock cycles for lower operating frequencies.
2. Not for S1.
