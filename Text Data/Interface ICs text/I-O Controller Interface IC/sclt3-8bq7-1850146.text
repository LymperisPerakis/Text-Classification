3           Functional description
3.1         Operation of the SCLT3 with SPI bus (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0)
            The SPI bus master controller manages the data transfer with the chip select signal /CS
            and controls the data shift in the register with the clock SCK signal.

            The transfer of the SCLT3 input states in the SPI registers starts when the chip select /CS
            signal falls and ends when this /CS is rising back.
            The transfer of data out of the SCLT3 slave MISO output starts immediately when the chip
            select /CS goes low.
            Then, the input MOSI is captured and presented to the shift register on each rising edge of
            the clock SCK. And the data are shifted in this register on each falling edge of the serial
            clock SCK, the data bits being written on the output MISO with the most significant bit first.
3.1.1       The serial data Input MOSI
            This input signal MOSI is used to shift external data bits into the SCLT3 register from the
            most significant MSB bit to the lower significant one LSB. The data bits are captured by the
            SCLT3 on the rising edge of the serial clock signal SCK.
3.2         The input digital filter
            Depending on the biasing of the SPM pin, the data frame is 8-bits or 16-bits.
            A digital filter is implemented between the input state comparator and the input state
            register. It consists of a 2-step sampling circuit that is controlled by an oscillator as shown
            on Figure 7.
            The filtering time tFT is set by the external oscillator resistor and is a function of the
            oscillator period tCKF:
                 2 x tCKF < tFT < 3 x tCKF
                 tCKF = Divider ratio x tOSC (ROSC)
            This period can be adjusted between 20 μs and 3000 μs as shown on Table 6:
            "Electromagnetic compatibility ratings".

         Being placed in the front end of the module, this filter increases the transient immunity of
         the SCLT and its SPI logic circuitry. It also simplifies the input management software task
         of the ASIC controller.

3.3      The SPI data transfer operation
3.3.1    The SPI data frame
         Depending on the biasing of the SPM pin, the data frame is 8-bits or 16-bits. The selected
         structure of the SPI is a 16-bit word in order to be able to implement the input state data
         and some control bits such as the UVA alarm, the 4 checksum bits and the two low and
         high state stop bits.
3.3.2    The SPI data transfer
         The SCLT3 transfers its 16 data bits through the SPI within one chip select Hi-Lo-Hi
         sequence. So, this length defines the minimum length that the shift register of the SPI
         master controller is able to capture: 16 bits.
         The Table 8 shows the 16-bit mode way the data are transferred starting from the data bits,
         the control bits and ending by a stop bit.

3.4         Control bit signals of the SPI transferred data frame
3.4.1       The power bus voltage monitoring
            The UVA circuit generates the alarm /UVA that is active low when the power bus voltage is
            lower than the activation threshold VCON, 17 V typical, and it is disabled high when the
            power bus voltage rises above the threshold VCOFF, 18 V typical.
3.4.2       The over temperature alarm
            The alarm signal /OTA is enabled, low state active, when the junction temperature is higher
            than the activation threshold TON, 150 ºC typical, and it is disabled when the junction
            temperature falls below the threshold TOFF, 140 ºC typical.
3.4.3       The parity checksum bits calculation and transfer
            The aim of the parity checksum bit is to detect one error in the transferred SPI word.
            Several parity checksum bits are generated and transmitted through the SPI on the control
            bit #2 to #5. In order to calculate parity bit, “exclusive NOR” operations are performed as
            follow:

3.5      Loss of VCC power supply
         The operation of the SCLT3 is extended below the levels required in the IEC 61131-2
         standard to allow the implementation of the under voltage alarm UVA as described the SPI
         control bit section.
         If there is no more power feeding on the VCC input, the SCLT3 chip goes to sleep mode,
         and the MISO output is forced in low state during SPI transfer attempt. The last SPI control
         data bit is a stop bit placed normally in high state all time: the loss of power supply is
         detected by checking its state: if low, the output is disabled by the internal power reset
         POR.
         This POR signal is active in low state when VC is less than 9 V or the internal power supply
         VDD is less than 3.25 V.
