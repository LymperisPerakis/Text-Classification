 You can determine the version of a data sheet by examining its literature number found on the bottom outside corner of any page.
 The last character of the literature number is the version number, (e.g., DS30000000A is version A of document DS30000000).
 Errata
 An errata sheet, describing minor operational differences from the data sheet and recommended workarounds, may exist for cur-
 rent devices. As device/documentation issues become known to us, we will publish an errata sheet. The errata will specify the
 revision of silicon and revision of document to which it applies.
 To determine if an errata sheet exists for a particular device, please check with one of the following:
 • Microchip’s Worldwide Web site; http://www.microchip.com
 • Your local Microchip sales office (see last page)
 When contacting a sales office, please specify which device, revision of silicon and data sheet (include -literature number) you are
 using.

General Description
The SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116 Product Family is a 3.3V (Super I/O Block is 5V tolerant) PC99/PC2001 compliant
Super I/O controller with an LPC interface. The SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116 Product Family also includes Hardware
Monitoring capabilities, enhanced Security features, Power Control logic and Motherboard Glue logic.
The SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116 Product Family's hardware monitoring capability includes temperature, voltage and
fan speed monitoring. It has the ability to alert the system of out-of-limit conditions and automatically control the speeds
of multiple fans. There are four analog inputs for monitoring external voltages of +5V, +2.5V, +12V and Vccp (core pro-
cessor voltage), as well as internal monitoring of the SIO's VCC, VTR, and Vbat power supplies. The SCH3112/
SCH3114/SCH3116 Product Family includes support for monitoring two external temperatures via thermal diode inputs
and an internal sensor for measuring ambient temperature. The nHWM_INT pin is implemented to indicate out-of-limit
temperature, voltage, and FANTACH conditions. The hardware monitoring block of the SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116
Product Family is accessible via the LPC bus. The same interrupt event reported on the nHWM_INT pin also creates
PME wakeup events. A separate THERMTRIP output is available, which generates a pulse output on a programmed
over temperature condition. This can be used to generate an reset or shutdown indicator to the system.
The hardware monitoring capability also has programmable automatic FAN control. Three fan tachometer inputs and
three pulse width modulator (PWM) outputs are available.
The Motherboard Glue logic includes various power management and system logic including generation of nRSMRST,
a programmable Clock output, and reset generation. The reset generation includes a watchdog timer which can be used
to generate a reset pulse. The width of this pulse is selectable via an external strapping option.
The SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116 Product Family incorporates complete legacy Super I/O functionality including an
8042 based keyboard and mouse controller, an IEEE 1284, EPP, and ECP compatible parallel port, multiple serial ports,
one IrDA 1.0 infrared ports, and a floppy disk controller with Microchip's true CMOS 765B core and enhanced digital
data separator, The true CMOS 765B core provides 100% compatibility with IBM PC/XT and PC/AT architectures and
is software and register compatible with Microchip's proprietary 82077AA core. System related functionality, which offers
flexibility to the system designer, General Purpose I/O control functions, and control of two LED's.
The serial ports are fully functional NS16550 compatible UARTs that support data rates up to 1.5 Mbps. There are four,
8 pin Serial Ports and two, 4pin Serial Ports. The reduced pin serial ports have selectable input and output controls. The
Serial Ports contain programmable direction control, which will automatically Drive nRTS when the Output Buffer is
loaded, then Drive nRTS when the Output Buffer is Empty.
The SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116 Product Family is ACPI 1.0/2.0 compatible and therefore supports multiple low
power-down modes. It incorporates sophisticated power control circuitry (PCC), which includes support for keyboard.
The SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116 Product Family supports the ISA Plug-and-Play Standard register set (Version 1.0a).
The I/O Address, DMA Channel and hardware IRQ of each logical device in the SCH3112/SCH3114/SCH3116 Product
Family may be reprogrammed through the internal configuration registers. There are up to 480 (960 - Parallel Port) I/O
address location options, a Serialized IRQ interface, and Three DMA channels.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •      Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •      Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
           intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •      There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
           knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
           Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •      Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •      Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
           mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR
    OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
