                 SC18IM700
                 Master I2C-bus controller with UART interface
                 Rev. 4 — 9 October 2019                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The SC18IM700 is designed to serve as an interface between the standard UART port of
              a microcontroller or microprocessor and the serial I2C-bus; this allows the microcontroller
              or microprocessor to communicate directly with other I2C-bus devices. The SC18IM700
              can operate as an I2C-bus master. The SC18IM700 controls all the I2C-bus specific
              sequences, protocol, arbitration and timing. The host communicates with SC18IM700 with
              ASCII messages protocol; this makes the control sequences from the host to the
              SC18IM700 become very simple.

7. Functional description
                       The SC18IM700 is a bridge between a UART port and I2C-bus. The UART interface
                       consists of a full-functional advanced UART. The UART communicates with the host
                       through the TX and RX pins. The serial data format is fixed: one start bit, 8 data bits, and
                       one stop bit. After reset the baud rate defaults to 9600 bit/s, and can be changed through
                       the Baud Rate Generator (BRG) registers.
                       After a power-up sequence or a hardware reset, the SC18IM700 will send two continuous
                       bytes to the host to indicate a start-up condition. These two bytes are 0x4F and 0x4B;
                       ‘OK’ in ASCII.
                   7.1 UART message format
                       The host initiates an I2C-bus data transfer, reads from and writes to SC18IM700 internal
                       registers through a series of ASCII commands. Table 4 lists the ASCII commands
                       supported by SC18IM700, and also their hexadecimal value representation.
                       Unrecognized commands are ignored by the device.
                       To prevent the host from handing the SC18IM700 due to an unfinished command
                       sequence, the SC18IM700 has a time-out feature. The delay between any two bytes of
                       data coming from the host should be less than 655 ms. If this condition is not met, the
                       SC18IM700 will time-out and clear the receive buffer. The SC18IM700 then starts to wait
                       for the next command from the host.

                7.1.1 Write N bytes to slave device
                       The host issues the write command by sending an S character followed by an I2C-bus
                       slave device address, the total number of bytes to be sent, and I2C-bus data which begins
                       with the first byte (DATA 0) and ends with the last byte (DATA N). The frame is then
                       terminated with a P character. Once the host issues this command, the SC18IM700 will
                       access the I2C-bus slave device and start sending the I2C-bus data bytes.
                       Note that the second byte sent is the I2C-bus device slave address. The least significant
                       bit (W) of this byte must be set to 0 to indicate this is an I2C-bus write command.

                      bytes from the addressed I2C-bus slave, and then return the data to the host.
                      Note that the second byte sent is the I2C-bus device slave address. The least significant
                      bit (R) of this byte must be set to 1 to indicate this is an I2C-bus write command.

                7.1.4 Read from 18IM internal register
                      The host issues the internal register read command by sending an R character followed
                      by the registers to be read. The frame is then terminated with a P character.
                      Once the command is issued, SC18IM700 will access its internal registers and returns the
                      contents of these registers to the host.

                7.1.5 Write to GPIO port
                      The host issues the output port write command by sending an O character followed by the
                      data to be written to the output port. This command enables the host to quickly set any
                      GPIO pins programmed as output without having to write to the SC18IM700 internal
                      IOState register.

                7.1.6 Read from GPIO port
                      The host issues the input port read command by sending an I character. This command
                      enables the host to quickly read any GPIO pins programmed as input without having to
                      read the SC18IM700 internal IOState register.
                      Once the command is issued, SC18IM700 will read its internal IOState register and
                      returns its content to the host.
                                                                                      I CHAR. P CHAR.

                7.1.7 Repeated START: read after write
                      The SC18IM700 also supports ‘read after write’ command as specified in the NXP
                      Semiconductors I2C-bus specification. This allows a read command to be sent after a
                      write command without having to issue a STOP condition between the two commands.
                      The host issues a write command as normal, then immediately issues a read command
                      without sending a STOP (P) character after the write command.

                      The host issues a write command as normal, then immediately issues a second write
                      command without sending a STOP (P) character after the first write command.

                7.1.9 Power-down mode
                      The SC18IM700 can be placed in a low-power mode. In this mode the internal oscillator is
                      stopped and SC18IM700 will no longer respond to the host messages. Enter the
                      Power-down mode by sending the power-down character Z (0x5A) followed by the two
                      defined bytes, which are 0x5A and followed by 0xA5. If the exact message is not received,
                      the device will not enter the power-down state.
                      Upon entering the power-down state, SC18IM700 places the WAKEUP pin in a HIGH
                      state. To have the device leave the power-down state, the WAKEUP pin should be
                      brought LOW. A 1 k resistor must be connected between the WAKEUP pin and VDD.
                                                                Z CHAR.              0x5A                  0xA5      P CHAR.

8. I2C-bus serial interface
                   The I2C-bus uses two wires (SDA and SCL) to transfer information between devices
                   connected to the bus, and it has the following features:
                    • Bidirectional data transfer between masters and slaves
                    • Multi-master bus (no central master)
                    • Arbitration between simultaneously transmitting masters without corruption of serial
                       data on the bus
                    • Serial clock synchronization allows devices with different bit rates to communicate via
                       one serial bus
                    • Serial clock synchronization can be used as a handshake mechanism to suspend and
                       resume serial transfer.
                   A typical I2C-bus configuration is shown in Figure 12. The SC18IM700 device provides a
                   byte-oriented I2C-bus interface that supports data transfers up to 400 kHz.

                                                                                          Master I2C-bus controller with UART interface
                   9.2 Register descriptions
                9.2.1 Baud Rate Generator (BRG)
                       The baud rate generator is an 8-bit counter that generates the data rate for the transmitter
                       and the receiver. The rate is programmed through the BRG register and the baud rate can
                       be calculated as follows:
                                                                           6
                                              7.3728  10
                       Baud rate = -----------------------------------------------------                                                                          (1)
                                      16 +  BRG1 BRG0 
                       Remark: To calculate the baud rate the values in the BRG registers must first be
                       converted from hex to decimal.
                       Remark: For the new baud rate to take effect, both BRG0 and BRG1 must be written in
                       sequence (BRG0, BRG1) with new values. The new baud rate will be in effect once BRG1
                       is written.
                9.2.2 Programmable port configuration (PortConf1 and PortConf2)
                       GPIO port 0 to port 7 may be configured by software to one of four types. These are:
                       quasi-bidirectional, push-pull, open-drain, and input-only. Two bits are used to select the
                       desired configuration for each port pin. PortConf1 is used to select the configuration for
                       GPIO3 to GPIO0, and PortConf2 is used to select the configuration for GPIO7 to GPIO4.
                       A port pin has Schmitt triggered input that also has a glitch suppression circuit.

                        0           1                      input-only configuration
                        1           0                      push-pull output configuration
                        1           1                      open-drain output configuration
               9.2.2.1 Quasi-bidirectional output configuration
                       Quasi-bidirectional output type can be used as both an input and output without the need
                       to reconfigure the port. This is possible because when the port outputs a logic HIGH, it is
                       weakly driven, allowing an external device to pull the pin LOW. When the pin is driven
                       LOW, it is driven strongly and able to sink a fairly large current. These features are
                       somewhat similar to an open-drain output except that there are three pull-up transistors in
                       the quasi-bidirectional output that serve different purposes.
                       The SC18IM700 is a 3 V device, but the pins are 5 V tolerant. In quasi-bidirectional mode,
                       if a user applies 5 V on the pin, there will be a current flowing from the pin to VDD, causing
                       extra power consumption. Therefore, applying 5 V in quasi-bidirectional mode is
                       discouraged.
                       A quasi-bidirectional port pin has a Schmitt triggered input that also has a glitch
                       suppression circuit.

               9.2.2.2 Input-only configuration
                       The input-only port configuration has no output drivers. It is a Schmitt triggered input that
                       also has a glitch suppression circuit.
                                                                  input data                                                  GPIO pin

                         Fig 14. Input-only configuration
               9.2.2.3 Push-pull output configuration
                       The push-pull output configuration has the same pull-down structure as both the
                       open-drain and the quasi-bidirectional output modes, but provides a continuous strong
                       pull-up when the port latch contains a logic 1. The push-pull mode may be used when
                       more source current is needed from a port output. A push-pull port pin has a Schmitt
                       triggered input that also has a glitch suppression circuit.
                                                                                                                       VDD

                                                                                                                                  GPIO pin

                                                                                                    Master I2C-bus controller with UART interface
               9.2.2.4 Open-drain output configuration
                       The open-drain output configuration turns off all pull-ups and only drives the pull-down
                       transistor of the port driver when the port latch contains a logic 0. To be used as a logic
                       output, a port configured in this manner must have an external pull-up, typically a resistor
                       tied to VDD.
                       An open-drain port pin has a Schmitt triggered input that also has a glitch suppression
                       circuit.
                                                                                                                                       GPIO pin

                                                                  logic 0 = set output pin to zero
                                                                  logic 1 = set output pin to one
                                                             Read this register returns states of all pins.
                9.2.4 I2C-bus address register (I2CAdr)
                       The contents of the register represents the device’s own I2C-bus address. The most
                       significant bit corresponds to the first bit received from the I2C-bus after a START
                       condition. A logic 1 in I2CAdr corresponds to a HIGH level on the I2C-bus, and a logic 0
                       corresponds to a LOW level on the I2C-bus. The least significant bit is not used, but
                       should be programmed with a ‘0’.
                       I2CAdr is not needed for device operation, but should be configured so that its address
                       does not conflict with an I2C-bus device address used by the bus master.
                9.2.5 I2C-bus clock rates (I2CClk)
                       This register determines the serial clock frequency. The various serial rates are shown in
                       Table 8. The frequency can be determined using the following formula:
                                                                                      6
                                                           7.3728  10
                       bit frequency = -------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                     (2)
                                             2   I2CClkH + I2CClkL 
                       I2CClkH determines the SCL HIGH period, and I2CClkL determines the SCL LOW period.

                      Remark: The numbers used in the formulas are in decimal, but the numbers to program
                      I2CClkH and I2CClkL are in hex.
                9.2.6 I2C-bus time-out (I2CTO)
                      The time-out register is used to determine the maximum time that SCL is allowed to be
                      LOW before the I2C-bus state machine is reset.
                      When the I2C-bus interface is running, I2CTO is loaded after each I2C-bus state transition.

                       Bit        Symbol                    Description
                       7:1        TO[7:1]                   time-out value

                                                                logic 1 = enable
                      The least significant bit of I2CTO (TE bit) is used as a time-out enable/disable. A logic 1
                      will enable the time-out function. The time-out period can be calculated as follows:
                                                 I2CTO  7:1   256

                      The time-out value may vary, and it is an approximate value.
                9.2.7 I2C-bus status register (I2CStat)
                      This register reports the I2C-bus transmit and receive frame status, whether the frame
                      transmits correctly or not.

[6]   GPIO in quasi-bidirectional mode with weak pull-up (applies to all GPIO pins with pull-ups). Does not apply to open-drain pins.
[7]   GPIO pins source a transition current when used in quasi-bidirectional mode and externally driven from logic 1 to logic 0. This current is
      highest when VI is approximately 2 V.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 19) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 14 and 15

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 19.
