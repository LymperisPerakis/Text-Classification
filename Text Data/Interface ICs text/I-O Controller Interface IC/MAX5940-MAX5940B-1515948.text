Note 1: All min/max limits are production tested at +85°C. Limits at +25°C and -40°C are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: The input offset current is illustrated in Figure 1.
Note 3: Effective differential input resistance is defined as the differential resistance between GND and VEE without any external
         resistance. See Figure 1.
Note 4: Classification current is turned off whenever the IC is in power mode.
Note 5: See Table 2 in the PD Classification Mode section. RDISC and RCL must be ±1%, 100ppm or better. ICLASS includes the IC
         bias current and the current drawn by RDISC.
Note 6: See the Thermal Dissipation section for details.
Note 7: When UVLO is connected to the midpoint of an external resistor-divider with a series resistance of 25.5kΩ (±1%), the turn-
         on threshold set-point for the power mode is defined by the external resistor-divider. Make sure the voltage on the UVLO
         pin does not exceed its maximum rating of 8V when VIN is at the maximum voltage (MAX5940B only).
Note 8: When the UVLO input voltage is below VTH,G,UVLO, the MAX5940B sets the UVLO threshold internally.
Note 9: An input voltage or VUVLO glitch below their respective thresholds shorter than or equal to t OFF_DLY does not cause the
         MAX5940A/MAX5940B/MAX5940C/MAX5940D to exit power-on mode (as long as the input voltage remains above an opera-
         ble voltage level of 12V).
Note 10: Guaranteed by design.
Note 11: PGOOD references to OUT while PGOOD references to VEE.
