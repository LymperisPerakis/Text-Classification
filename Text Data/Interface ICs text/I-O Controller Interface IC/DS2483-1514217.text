1-Wire slave devices. Relative to any attached 1-Wire
slave device, the DS2483 is a 1-Wire master. Internal,                                S Adjustable 1-Wire Timing for tRSTL, tMSP, tW0L,

Note 1: Limits are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and/or TA = +85°C. Limits over the operating temperature range and
           relevant supply voltage range are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical values are not guaranteed.
Note 2: The VCI2C voltage is applied at the SLPZ pin. VCI2C must always be < VCC. The DS2483 measures VCI2C after tSWUP
           (wakeup from sleep mode) or after tOSCWUP (power-on reset). The Device Reset command does not cause the DS2483 to
           measure VCI2C.
Note 3: The active pullup does not apply to the rising edge of a presence pulse outside of a 1-Wire Reset command or during the
           recovery after a short on the 1-Wire line.
Note 4: Guaranteed design and not production tested.
Note 5: Except for tF1, all 1-Wire timing specifications are derived from the same timing circuit.
Note 6: Although 1-Wire slave data sheets specify a tW1L and tRL minimum of 1µs, 1-Wire slaves will accept the shorter 0.71µs
           tW1L and tRL of the DS2483.
Note 7: VCCACT refers to the VCC level being applied in the application.
Note 8: I2C communication should not take place for the max tOSCWUP or tSWUP time following a power-on reset or a wake-up
           from sleep mode.
Note 9: All I2C timing values are referenced to VIH(MIN) and VIL(MAX) levels.
Note 10: The DS2483 does not obstruct the SDA and SCL lines if SLPZ is at 0V or if VCC is switched off.
Note 11: The DS2483 provides a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referenced to the VIH(MIN) of the SCL signal) to
           bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
Note 12: The maximum tHD:DAT must only be met if the device does not stretch the low period (tLOW) of the SCL signal.
Note 13: A fast mode I2C bus device can be used in a standard mode I2C bus system, but the requirement tSU:DAT R 250ns
           must then be met. This requirement is met since the DS2483 does not stretch the low period of the SCL signal. Also the
           acknowledge timing must meet this setup time (I2C bus specification Rev. 03, 19 June 2007).
Note 14: CB = Total capacitance of one bus line in pF. The maximum bus capacitance allowable can vary from this value depend-
           ing on the actual operating voltage and frequency of the application (I2C bus specification Rev. 03, 19 June 2007).

         NOTE: DEPENDING ON ITS INTERNAL STATE, A 1-Wire SLAVE DEVICE TRANSMITS DATA TO ITS MASTER (e.g., THE DS2483). WHEN RESPONDING WITH A 0,
         A 1-Wire SLAVE STARTS PULLING THE LINE LOW DURING tW1L. ITS INTERNAL TIMING GENERATOR DETERMINES WHEN THIS PULLDOWN ENDS AND THE VOLTAGE
         STARTS RISING AGAIN. WHEN RESPONDING WITH A 1, A 1-Wire SLAVE DOES NOT HOLD THE LINE LOW AT ALL, AND THE VOLTAGE STARTS RISING AS SOON AS tW1L
         IS OVER. 1-Wire DEVICE DATA SHEETS USE THE TERM tRL INSTEAD OF tW1L TO DESCRIBE A READ-DATA TIME SLOT. TECHNICALLY, tRL AND tW1L HAVE IDENTICAL
         SPECIFICATIONS AND CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM EACH OTHER.

 Command Parameter              Direction Byte
                                Generates three time slots: two read time slots and one write time slot at the 1-Wire line. The
                                type of write time slot depends on the result of the read time slots and the direction byte.
                                The direction byte determines the type of write time slot if both read time slots are 0 (a typi-
                                cal case). In this case, the DS2483 generates a write-one time slot if V = 1 and a write-zero

                                If the read time slots are 0 and 1, they are followed by a write-zero time slot.
                                If the read time slots are 1 and 0, they are followed by a write-one time slot.
                                If the read time slots are both 1 (error case), the subsequent write time slot is a write-one.

                           Reading from the DS2483
To read from the DS2483, the master must access the                       Master-to-Slave Slave-to-Master
device in read mode, i.e., the slave address must be sent
with the direction bit set to 1. The read pointer determines
the register that the master reads from. The master can
continue reading the same register over and over again,
without having to readdress the device, e.g., to watch
the 1WB changing from 1 to 0. To read from a different
register, the master must issue the Set Read Pointer com-
mand and then access the DS2483 again in read mode.

  Verifying the 1-Wire port configuration
  The Adjust 1-Wire Port command sets the read pointer to the Port Configuration register. If other commands were
  issued to the DS2483 since then, use the Set Read Pointer command first to position the read pointer to the Port
  Configuration register.

  In the first cycle, the master sends the command. Then the master waits (Idle) for the 1-Wire reset to complete. In
  the second cycle, the DS2483 is accessed to read the result of the 1-Wire reset from the Status register.
  Case B: 1-Wire Idle (1WB = 0), Busy Polling Until the 1-Wire Command is Completed, then Read the Result

  33h is the valid 1-Wire ROM function command for Read ROM. The idle time is needed for the 1-Wire function to
  complete. There is no data read back from the 1-Wire line with this command.
