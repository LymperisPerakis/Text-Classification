LPC47M182
Description
The LPC47M182 is a 3.3V (5V tolerant) PC99a/PC2001 compliant Advanced I/O controller for Desktop PCs. The
device, which implements the Low Pin Count (LPC) interface, includes I/O functionality as well as Motherboard GLUE
logic into a 128-pin package. This is a space saving solution on the motherboard resulting in lower cost. The
LPC47M182 also provides 13 general purpose pins, which offer flexibility to the system designer, and two Fan
Tachometer Inputs. The LPC47M182’s LPC interface supports LPC I/O and DMA cycles.
The LPC47M182 includes complete legacy I/O: a keyboard interface; Microchip's true CMOS 765B floppy disk
controller with advanced digital data separator; two 16C550A compatible UARTs; one Multi-Mode parallel port
including ChiProtect circuitry plus EPP and ECP. The true CMOS 765B core provides 100% compatibility with IBM PC/
XT and PC/AT architectures, in addition, it provides data overflow and underflow protection. The Microchip’s patented
advanced digital data separator allows for ease of testing and use. The parallel port is compatible with IBM PC/AT
architecture, as well as IEEE 1284 EPP and ECP. The LPC47M182 incorporates sophisticated power control circuitry
(PCC) which includes support for keyboard and mouse wake up events as well as PME support. The PCC supports
multiple low power-down modes. The LPC47M182 is ACPI 1.0b/2.0 compatible.
The Motherboard GLUE logic includes various power management logic; including generation of nRSMRST, Power
OK signal generation, 5V main and standby reference generation. There are also three LEDs to indicate power status
and hard drive activity. The translation circuit converts 3.3V signals to 5V signals. Also included is SMBus main power
well to resume power well isolation circuitry.
The LPC47M182 supports the ISA Plug-and-Play Standard register set (Version 1.0a). The I/O Address, DMA
Channel and hardware IRQ of each logical device in the LPC47M182 may be reprogrammed through the internal
configuration registers. There are up to 480 (960 for Parallel Port) I/O address location options, a Serialized IRQ
interface, and three DMA channels. On chip, Interrupt Generating Registers enable external software to generate IRQ1
through IRQ15 on the Serial IRQ Interface.
The LPC47M182’s Enhanced Digital Data Separator does not require any external filter components and is therefore
easy to use and offers lower system costs and reduced board area. The LPC47M182 is register compatible with Micro-
chip’s proprietary 82077AA core.

 Most Current Data Sheet
 To obtain the most up-to-date version of this data sheet, please register at our Worldwide Web site at:
        http://www.microchip.com
 You can determine the version of a data sheet by examining its literature number found on the bottom outside corner of any page.
 The last character of the literature number is the version number, (e.g., DS30000000A is version A of document DS30000000).
 Errata
 An errata sheet, describing minor operational differences from the data sheet and recommended workarounds, may exist for cur-
 rent devices. As device/documentation issues become known to us, we will publish an errata sheet. The errata will specify the
 revision of silicon and revision of document to which it applies.
 To determine if an errata sheet exists for a particular device, please check with one of the following:
 • Microchip’s Worldwide Web site; http://www.microchip.com
 • Your local Microchip sales office (see last page)
 When contacting a sales office, please specify which device, revision of silicon and data sheet (include -literature number) you are
 using.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.
•     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
      knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
      Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
      mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO

OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
