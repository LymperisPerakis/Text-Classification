Note 1:     Operating current with 1-Wire write-byte sequence followed by continuously reading the Status Register at 400kHz in overdrive.
Note 2:     With standard speed, the total capacitive load of the 1-Wire bus should not exceed 1nF. Otherwise, the passive pullup on
            threshold VIL1 may not be reached in the available time. With overdrive speed, the capacitive load on the 1-Wire bus must
            not exceed 300pF.
Note 3:     Active pullup guaranteed to turn on between VIL1(MAX) and VIH1(MIN).
Note 4:     Active or resistive pullup choice is configurable.
Note 5:     Except for tF1, all 1-Wire timing specifications and tAPUOT are derived from the same timing circuit. Therefore, if one of
            these parameters is found to be off the typical value, it is safe to assume that all these parameters deviate from their typi-
            cal value in the same direction and by the same degree.
Note 6:     These values apply at full load, i.e., 1nF at standard speed and 0.3nF at overdrive speed. For reduced load, the pulldown
            slew rate is slightly faster.
Note 7:     Fall time high-to-low (tF1) is derived from PDSRC, referenced from 0.9 x VCC to 0.1 x VCC.
Note 8:     I2C communication should not take place for the max tOSCWUP or tSWUP time following a power-on reset or a wakeup from
            sleep mode.
Note 9:     Guaranteed by design and not production tested.
Note 10:    All I2C timing values are referred to VIH(MIN) and VIL(MAX) levels.
Note 11:    Applies to SDA, SCL, and AD0.
Note 12:    The input/output pins of the DS2482-101 do not obstruct the SDA and SCL lines if VCC is switched off.
Note 13:    The DS2482-101 provides a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIH(MIN) of the SCL signal) to
            bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
Note 14:    The maximum tHD:DAT need only be met if the device does not stretch the low period (tLOW) of the SCL signal.
Note 15:    A fast-mode I2C bus device can be used in a standard-mode I2C bus system, but the requirement tSU:DAT ≥ 250ns must
            then be met. This is automatically the case if the device does not stretch the low period of the SCL signal. If such a device
            does stretch the low period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the SDA line tR(MAX) + tSU:DAT = 1000 +
            250 = 1250ns (according to the standard-mode I2C bus specification) before the SCL line is released.
Note 16:    CB—Total capacitance of one bus line in pF. If mixed with high-speed-mode devices, faster fall times according to I2C-
            Bus Specification Version 2.1 are allowed.

                             Generates three time slots: two read time slots and one write time slot at the 1-Wire line. The type
                             of write time slot depends on the result of the read time slots and the direction byte. The direction
                             byte determines the type of write time slot if both read time slots are 0 (a typical case). In this
                             case, the DS2482-101 generates a write-one time slot if V = 1 and a write-zero time slot if V = 0.
 Description
                             See Table 3.
                             If the read time slots are 0 and 1, they are followed by a write-zero time slot.
                             If the read time slots are 1 and 0, they are followed by a write-one time slot.
                             If the read time slots are both 1 (error case), the subsequent write time slot is a write-one.

requires a pullup resistor to realize high-logic levels.                      RPMAXF = 300ns/[CB x ln(7/3)] (fast speed)
Because the DS2482-101 uses SCL only as input (no                      For a bus capacitance of 400pF, the maximum pullup
