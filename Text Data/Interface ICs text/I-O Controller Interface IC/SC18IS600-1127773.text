                 SC18IS600
                 SPI to I2C-bus interface
                 Rev. 8 — 9 October 2019                                            Product data sheet
1. General description
              The SC18IS600 is designed to serve as an interface between the standard SPI of a host
              (microcontroller, microprocessor, chip set, etc.) and the serial I2C-bus. This allows the
              host to communicate directly with other I2C-bus devices. The SC18IS600 can operate as
              an I2C-bus master-transmitter or master-receiver. The SC18IS600 controls all the I2C-bus
              specific sequences, protocol, arbitration and timing.

6. Functional description
                         The SC18IS600 acts as a bridge between a SPI interface and an I2C-bus. It allows a SPI
                         master device to communicate with I2C-bus slave devices. The SPI interface supports

                   6.2 Register descriptions
                6.2.1 Programmable IO port configuration register (IOConfig)
                         Pins GPIO0 to GPIO3 may be configured by software to one of four types. These are:
                         quasi-bidirectional, push-pull, open-drain, and input-only. Two configuration bits per pin,
                         located in the IOConfig register, select the IO type for each pin. Each pin has
                         Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression circuit. IO4 and IO5 are
                         quasi-bidirectional pins and are not user-configurable.
                         Table 5 shows the configurations for the programmable I/O pins. IOx.1 and IOx.0
                         correspond to GPIOx.

               6.2.1.1   Quasi-bidirectional output configuration
                         Quasi-bidirectional outputs can be used both as an input and output without the need to
                         reconfigure the pin. This is possible because when the pin outputs a logic HIGH, it is
                         weakly driven, allowing an external device to pull the pin LOW. When the pin is driven
                         LOW, it is driven strongly and able to sink a large current. There are three pull-up
                         transistors in the quasi-bidirectional output that serve different purposes.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                   SC18IS600
                                                                                                                                   SPI to I2C-bus interface
                       One of these pull-ups, called the ‘very weak’ pull-up, is turned on whenever the pin latch
                       for the pin contains a logic 1. This very weak pull-up sources a very small current that will
                       pull the pin HIGH if it is left floating.
                       A second pull-up, called the ‘weak’ pull-up, is turned on when the pin latch for the pin
                       contains a logic 1 and the pin itself is also at a logic 1 level. This pull-up provides the
                       primary source current for a quasi-bidirectional pin that is outputting a 1. If this pin is
                       pulled LOW by an external device, the weak pull-up turns off, and only the very weak
                       pull-up remains on. In order to pull the pin LOW under these conditions, the external
                       device has to sink enough current to overpower the weak pull-up and pull the pin below its
                       input threshold voltage.
                       The third pull-up is referred to as the ‘strong’ pull-up. This pull-up is used to speed up
                       LOW-to-HIGH transitions on a quasi-bidirectional pin when the pin latch changes from a
                       logic 0 to a logic 1. When this occurs, the strong pull-up turns on for two system clock
                       cycles quickly pulling the pin HIGH.
                       The quasi-bidirectional pin configuration is shown in Figure 3.
                       Although the SC18IS600 is a 3 V device, most of the pins are 5 V tolerant. If 5 V is applied
                       to a pin configured in quasi-bidirectional mode, there will be a current flowing from the pin
                       to VDD causing extra power consumption. Therefore, applying 5 V to pins configured in
                       quasi-bidirectional mode is discouraged.
                       A quasi-bidirectional pin has a Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression
                       circuit.

               6.2.1.2 Open-drain output configuration
                       The open-drain output configuration turns off all pull-ups and only drives the pull-down
                       transistor of the pin when the pin latch contains a logic 0. To be used as a logic output, a
                       pin configured in this manner must have an external pull-up, typically a resistor tied to
                       VDD. The pull-down for this mode is the same as for the quasi-bidirectional mode.
                       The open-drain pin configuration is shown in Figure 4.
                       An open-drain pin has a Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression circuit.

                       The push-pull output configuration has the same pull-down structure as both the
                       open-drain and the quasi-bidirectional output modes, but provides a continuous strong
                       pull-up when the pin latch contains a logic 1. The push-pull mode may be used when
                       more source current is needed from a pin output.
                       The push-pull pin configuration is shown in Figure 6.
                       A push-pull pin has a Schmitt-triggered input that also has a glitch suppression circuit.

                6.2.3 I2C-bus address register (I2CAdr)
                      The contents of the register represents the device’s own I2C-bus address. The most
                      significant bit corresponds to the first bit received from the I2C-bus after a START
                      condition. The least significant bit is not used, but should be programmed with a ‘0’.
                      I2CAdr is not needed for device operation, but should be configured so that its address
                      does not conflict with an I2C-bus device address used by the bus master.
                6.2.4 I2C-bus clock rates register (I2CClk)
                      This register determines the I2C-bus clock frequency. Various clock rates are shown in
                      Table 7 for the SC18IS600. The frequency can be determined using Equation 1:
                                                                                          6

                6.2.5 I2C-bus time-out register (I2CTO)
                      The time-out register is used to determine the maximum time that the I2C-bus master is
                      allowed to complete a transfer before setting an I2C-bus time-out interrupt.

                      The least significant bit of I2CTO (TE bit) is used as a time-out enable/disable. A logic 1
                      will enable the time-out function.

                         On the SC18IS600 the time-out oscillator operates at 57.6 kHz.
                         This oscillator is fed into a 16-bit down counter. The down counter’s lower nine bits are
                         loaded with ‘1’, while the upper seven bits are loaded with the contents of I2CTO.
                                                               57.6 kHz                   16-BIT DOWN COUNTER

                         The time-out value is an approximate value.
                         In the case of arbitration loss, the SC18IS600 will transmit a START condition when the
                         bus becomes free unless the time-out condition is reached. If the time-out condition is
                         reached, an interrupt will be generated on the INT pin. The ‘I2C-bus time-out’ status can
                         be read in I2CStat.
                 6.2.6 I2C-bus status register (I2CStat)
                         This register reports the results of I2C-bus transmit and receive transaction between
                         SC18IS600 and an I2C-bus slave device.

                   6.3 I2C-bus serial interface
                       I2C-bus uses two wires (SDA and SCL) to transfer information between devices
                       connected to the bus, and it has the following features:
                         • Bidirectional data transfer between masters and slaves
                         • Multi-master bus (no central master)
                         • Arbitration between simultaneously transmitting masters without corruption of serial
                            data on the bus
                         • Serial clock synchronization allows devices with different bit rates to communicate via
                            one serial bus
                         • Serial clock synchronization can be used as a handshake mechanism to suspend and
                            resume serial transfer
                         • The I2C-bus may be used for test and diagnostic purposes.
                       A typical I2C-bus configuration is shown in Figure 8. The SC18IS600 device provides a
                       byte-oriented I2C-bus interface that supports data transfers up to 400 kHz. (Refer to
                       UM10204, “I2C-bus specification and user manual”.)

                   6.4 Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
                       The host communicates with the SC18IS600 via the SPI interface. The SC18IS600
                       operates in Slave mode up to 3 Mbit/s.
                       The SPI interface has four pins: SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and CS.
                         • SCLK, MOSI and MISO are typically tied together between two or more SPI devices.
                            Data flows from the master to the SC18IS600 on the MOSI (Master Out Slave In) pin
                            and flows from SC18IS600 to the master on the MISO (Master In Slave Out) pin. The
                            SCLK signal is an input to the SC18IS600.
                         • CS is the slave select pin. In a typical configuration, an SPI master selects one SPI
                            device as the current slave. An SPI slave device uses its CS pin to determine whether
                            it is selected.
                       Typical connections are shown in Figure 9.

  Fig 10. Write N bytes to I2C-bus slave device
                               The SPI host issues the write command by sending a 0x00 command followed by the total
                               number of bytes (maximum 96 bytes excluding the address) to send and an I2C-bus slave
                               device address followed by I2C-bus data bytes, beginning with the first byte (data byte 1)
                               and ending with the last byte (data byte N). Once the SPI host issues this command, the
                               SC18IS600 will access the I2C-bus slave device and start sending the I2C-bus data bytes.
                               When the I2C-bus write transaction has successfully finished, and interrupt is generated
                               on the INT pin, and the ‘transaction completed’ status can be read in I2CStat.
                               Note that the third byte sent by the host is the device I2C-bus slave address. The
                               SC18IS600 will ignore the least significant bit so a write will always be performed even if
                               the least significant bit is a ‘1’.

                      Once the host issues this command, the SC18IS600 will start an I2C-bus read transaction
                      on the I2C-bus to the specified slave address. Once the data is received, the SC18IS600
                      will place this data in the receiver buffer, and will generate an interrupt on the INT pin. The
                      ‘transaction completed’ status can be read in the I2CStat. Note that the data is not
                      returned until a Read Buffer command is performed (see Section 6.5.4 “Read buffer”).
                      Note that the third byte sent by the host is the device slave address. The SC18IS600 will
                      ignore the least significant bit so a read will always be performed even if the least
                      significant bit is a ‘0’. The maximum number of bytes to be read is 96.

                      I2C-bus to the specified slave address. Once the data is written, the SC18IS600 will read
                      data from the specified slave, place the data in the Receiver Buffer and generate an
                      interrupt on the INT pin. The ‘transaction completed’ status can be read in I2CStat. Note
                      that the data is not returned until a ‘Read Buffer’ command is performed.

                          When the host issues a Read Buffer command, the SC18IS600 will return the data in the

                          ‘Read N bytes’ or a ‘Read after write’ command is executed before the Read Buffer
                          command.

                          When the host issues this command, the SC18IS600 will first write N data bytes to the
                          I2C-bus slave 1 device followed by a write of M data bytes to the I2C-bus slave 2 device.

                          data byte are sent on the SPI bus. In the LSB first configuration (SPI configuration data is
                          0x81), bit 0 is the first bit sent of any SPI byte. In MSB first (SPI configuration data is
                          0x42), bit 7 is the first bit sent. Table 10 shows the two possible configurations that can be
                          programmed.

                      register address to be written (see Section 6.1). The register data byte follows the register
                      address. Only one register can be accessed in a single transaction. There is no
                      auto-incrementing of the register address.

                      A Read Register function is initiated by sending a 0x21 command followed by an internal
                      register address to be read (see Section 6.1) and a dummy byte. The data byte of the
                      read register is returned by the SC18IS600 on the MISO pin. Only one register can be
                      accessed in a single transaction. There is no auto-incrementing of the register address.
                      Note that write and read from internal registers are processed immediately as soon as the
                      SC18IS600 determines the intended register.

                               The SC18IS600 can be placed in a low-power mode where the internal oscillator is
                               stopped and it will no longer respond to SPI messages. Enter the Power-down mode by
                               sending the power-down command (0x30) followed by the two defined bytes, which are
                               0x5A followed by 0xA5. If the exact message is not received, the device will not enter the
                               power-down state.
                               Before entering the power-down state, WAKEUP/IO4 should be placed in a HIGH state.
                               To exit the power-down state, the WAKEUP/IO4 should be brought LOW. After leaving the
                               power-down state, the WAKEUP/IO4 can once again be used as a general-purpose IO
                               pin.

11. Soldering of SMD packages
                      This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                      of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                      soldering description”.
                 11.1 Introduction to soldering
                      Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                      Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                      the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                      ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                      Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                      suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                      densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                 11.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                      Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                      a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                        • Through-hole components
                        • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                      Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                      packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                      leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                      due to an increased probability of bridging.
                      The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                      component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                      packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                      Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                        • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                        • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                        • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                        • Package placement
                        • Inspection and repair
                        • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                 11.3 Wave soldering
                      Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                        • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                        • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                 11.4 Reflow soldering
                      Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                        • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                           higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 25) than a SnPb process, thus
                           reducing the process window
                        • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                           window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                        • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                           heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                           temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                           characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                           packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                           depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                           Table 16 and 17

                      Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                      times.
                      Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                      soldering, see Figure 25.
