4. Block diagram
                        A block diagram of the TJA1100 is shown in Figure 1. The 100BASE-T1 section contains
                        the functional blocks specified in the 100BASE-T1 standard that make up the Physical
                        Coding Sublayer (PCS) and the Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) layer for both the
                        transmit and receive signal paths. The MII/RMII interface (including the Serial
                        Management Interface (SMI)) conforms to IEEE802.3 clause 22.
                        Additional blocks are defined for mode control, register configuration, interrupt control,
                        system configuration, reset control, LED control, local wake-up and configuration control.
                        A number of power supply related functional blocks are defined: Very Low Power (VLP)
                        supply in Sleep mode, Reset circuit, supply monitoring and a 1.8 V regulator for the digital
                        core. Pin strapping allows a number of default PHY settings (e.g. Master or Slave
                        configuration) to be hardware-configured at power-up.
                        The clock signals needed for the operation of the PHY are generated in the PLL block,
                        derived from an external crystal or an oscillator input signal.

                         The pin configuration of the TJA1100 is shown in Figure 2. The following standard
                         interfaces are provided by the TJA1100: MII/RMII (including SMI) and MDI. Since
                         100BASE-T1 allows for full-duplex bidirectional communication, the standard MII signals
                         COL and CRS are not needed.

6. Functional description
                   6.1 System configuration
                         A 100BASE-T1 compliant Ethernet PHY, the TJA1100 provides 100 Mbit/s transmit and
                         receive capability over a single unshielded twisted-pair cable, supporting a cable length of
                         up to at least 15 m with a bit error rate less than or equal to 1E10. It is optimized for
                         capacitive signal coupling to the twisted-pair lines. To comply with automotive EMC
                         requirements, a common-mode choke (CMC) is typically inserted into the signal path.
                         The TJA1100 is designed to provide a cost-optimized system solution for automotive
                         Ethernet links. Communication with the Media Access Control (MAC) unit can be realized
                         via the MII or the RMII.

                   6.2 MII and RMII
                         The TJA1100 contains MII and RMII interfaces to the MAC controller.
                 6.2.1 MII
                6.2.1.1  Signaling and encoding
                         The connections between the PHY and the MAC are shown in more detail in Figure 4.
                         Data is exchanged via 4-bit wide data nibbles on TXD[3:0] and RXD[3:0]. Transmit and
                         receive data is synchronized with the transmit (TXC) and receive (RXC) clocks. Both clock
                         signals are provided by the PHY and are typically derived from an external crystal running
                         at a nominal frequency of 25 MHz (100 ppm). Normal data transmission is initiated with a
                         HIGH level on TXEN, while a HIGH level on RXDV indicates normal data reception.
                         MII encoding is described in Table 3 and Table 4.

                6.2.2 RMII
               6.2.2.1 Signaling and encoding
                       In the case of RMII, data is exchanged via 2-bit wide data nibbles on TXD[1:0] and
                       RXD[1:0], as illustrated in Figure 5. To achieve the same data rate as MII, the interface is
                       clocked at a nominal frequency of 50 MHz. A single clock signal, REF_CLK, is provided
                       for both transmit and received data. This clock signal is provided by the PHY and is
                       typically derived from an external 25 MHz (100 ppm) crystal (see Figure 5). Alternatively,
                       a 50 MHz clock signal (50 ppm) generated by an external oscillator can be connected to
                       pin REFCLK_IN (see Figure 6).
                       RMII encoding is described in Table 5 and Table 6.

                6.2.3 Reverse MII
                       In Reverse MII mode, two PHYs are connected back-to-back via the MII interface to
                       realize a repeater function on the physical layer (see Figure 7). The MII signals are
                       cross-connected: RX output signals from each PHY are connected to the TX inputs on the
                       other PHY. For the PHY connected in Reverse MII mode, the TXC and RXC clock signals
                       become inputs.
                       Since the MII interface is a standardized solution, two PHYs can be used to implement
                       two different physical layers to realize, for example, a conversion from Fast Ethernet to
                       100BASE-T1 and vice versa. Another use case for such a repeater could be to double the
                       link length up to 30 m.

                6.3.1 Operating modes
               6.3.1.1 Power-off mode
                       TJA1100 remains in Power-off mode as long as the voltage on pin VBAT is below the
                       power-on reset threshold. The analog blocks are disabled and the digital blocks are in a
                       passive reset state in this mode.
               6.3.1.2 Standby mode
                       At power-on, when the voltage on pin VBAT rises above the under-voltage recovery
                       threshold (Vuvr(VBAT)), the TJA1100 enters Standby mode, switching on the INH control
                       output. This control signal may be used to activate the supply to the microcontroller in the
                       ECU. Once the 3.3 V supply voltage is available, the internal 1.8 V regulators are
                       activated and the PHY is configured according to the pin-strapping implemented on the
                       CONFIGn and PHYADn pins. No SMI access takes place during the power-on settling
                       time (ts(pon)).
                       From an operating point of view, Standby mode corresponds to the IEEE 802.3
                       Power-down mode, where the transmit and receive functions (in the PHY) are disabled.
                       Standby mode also acts as a fail-silent mode. The TJA1100 switches to Standby mode
                       when an under-voltage condition is detected on VDDA(3V3), VDDA(1V8), VDDD(1V8) or VDD(IO).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                               TJA1100
                                                                                                   100BASE-T1 PHY for Automotive Ethernet
               6.3.1.3 Normal mode
                       To establish a communication link, the TJA1100 must be switched to Normal mode, either
                       autonomously (AUTO_OP = 1; see Table 20) or via an SMI command (AUTO_OP = 0).
                       When the PHY is configured for autonomous operation, the TJA1100 will automatically
                       enter Normal mode and activate the link on power-on.
                       When the PHY is host-controlled, the internal PLL starts running when the TJA1100
                       enters Normal mode and the transmit and receive functions (both PCS and PMA) are
                       enabled. After a period of stabilization, tinit(PHY), the TJA1100 is ready to set up a link.
                       Once the LINK_CONTROL bit is set to 'ENABLE', the PHY configured as Master initiates
                       the training sequence by transmitting idle pulses. The link is established when bit
                       LINK_UP in the Communication Status register is set.
               6.3.1.4 Disable mode
                       Whenever the Ethernet interface is not in use or must be disabled for fail-safe reasons,
                       the PHY can be switched off by pulling pin EN LOW. The PHY is switched off completely
                       in Disable mode, minimizing power consumption. The configuration register settings are
                       maintained. To exit Disable mode, pin EN must be forced HIGH to activate the PHY.
               6.3.1.5 Sleep mode
                       If the network management in a node decides to withdraw from the network because the
                       functions of the node are no longer needed, it may power down the entire ECU via PHY
                       Sleep mode. In Sleep mode, the transmit and receive functions are switched off and no
                       signal is driven onto the twisted-pair lines. Transmit requests from the MII interface are
                       ignored and the MII output pins are in a high-ohmic state. The SMI is also deactivated to
                       minimize power consumption.
                       By releasing the INH output, the ECU is allowed to switch off its main power supply unit.
                       Typically, the entire ECU is powered-down. The TJA1100 is kept partly alive by the
                       permanent battery supply and can still react to activity on the Ethernet lines. Once valid
                       Ethernet idle pulses are detected on the lines, the TJA1100 wakes up, switching on the
                       main power unit via the INH control signal. As soon as the supply voltages are stable
                       within their operating ranges, the TJA1100 can be switched to Normal mode via an SMI
                       command and the communication link to the partner can be re-established. Sleep mode
                       can be entered from Normal mode via the intermediate Sleep Request mode as well as
                       from Standby mode, as shown in Figure 8. Note that the configuration register settings are
                       maintained in Sleep mode.
               6.3.1.6 Sleep Request mode
                       Sleep Request mode is an intermediate state used to introduce a transition to Sleep
                       mode. The PHY sleep request timer starts when the TJA1100 enters Sleep Request
                       mode. This timer determines how long the PHY remains in Sleep Request mode. When
                       the timer expires (after tto(req)sleep), the PHY switches to Sleep mode and INH is switched
                       off. The PHY does not expect to receive Ethernet frames in Sleep Request mode. If any
                       Ethernet frames are received at MDI or MII in Sleep Request mode, the PHY returns to
                       Normal mode, the DATA_DET_WU flag in the General status register is set and a
                       WAKEUP interrupt is generated.
                       Table 7 presents an overview of the status of TJA1100 functional blocks in each operating
                       mode.

                            via internal 100 k pull-down resistors.
                       [2]  Pins configured as outputs will be LOW in Standby mode.
                       [3]  In Normal mode, this pin is used as the TXCLK output for the test modes and the slave jitter test (the PHY
                            enable input is held HIGH internally during this time).
                       [4]  The WAKE input is active in Standby, Sleep Request and Sleep modes if LED_ENABLE = 0; the LED
                            output is active in Normal and Sleep Request modes if LED_ENABLE = 1.
                       [5]  The behavior of the INH output in Disable mode is configurable.
               6.3.1.7 Reset mode
                       The TJA1100 switches to Reset mode from any mode except Power-off when pin RST_N
                       is held LOW for at least the maximum reset detection time (tdet(rst)(max)), provided the
                       voltage on VDD(IO) is above the undervoltage threshold.
                       When RST_N goes HIGH again, or an undervoltage is detected on VDD(IO), the TJA1100,
                       switches to Standby mode. All register bits are reset to their default values in Reset mode.

                6.3.2 Transitions between operating modes
                      One of the key features of the TJA1100 is the possibility to put a link and its associated
                      nodes into Sleep mode, while ensuring that the node can be woken up by activity on the
                      Ethernet wires. A node can be switched to Sleep mode when link operation is not needed,
                      minimizing power consumption.
                      Figure 8 shows the TJA1100 mode transition diagram. For a detailed description of the
                      Sleep transition process, see the TJA1100 application hints [Ref. 1].
                      The following events, listed in order of priority, trigger mode transitions:
                       •  Power on/off
                       •  Undervoltage on VDD(IO) or VDDD(1V8)
                       •  RST_N input
                       •  EN input
                       •  Overtemperature or Undervoltage on VDDA(3V3), VDDA(1V8) or VDDD(1V8)
                       •  SMI command and wake-up (local or remote)

                       6.4 Wake-up request
                              A link that is in Sleep mode must be woken up before the link can be re-established. The
                              node requesting the link can issue a wake request by sending idle symbols onto the link.
                              The link partner detects the idle activity and wakes up.
                              For the Master PHY, it is only necessary to enable link control (LINK_CONTROL = 1). The
                              training sequence is then detected as a wake-up request. For the Slave PHY, a link
                              wake-up request is issued by setting bit WAKE_REQUEST in the Extended Control

                                                                                                   100BASE-T1 PHY for Automotive Ethernet
                       register to 1 while the TJA1100 is in Normal mode with link control disabled
                       (LINK_CONTROL = 0). The wake request phase lasts at least 5 ms to ensure a reliable
                       wake-up. The TJA1100 aborts this wake request and stops sending idle symbols if bit
                       WAKE_REQUEST is reset or link control is enabled.
                   6.5 Wake-up
                       When the TJA1100 detects a wake-up event, a WAKEUP interrupt is generated and the
                       wake-up source is indicated in the General status register (status bits LOCAL_WU,
                       REMOTE_WU and DATA_DET_WU; see Table 26). The wake-up source status bits are
                       reset when the TJA1100 enters Sleep Request or Sleep mode. The TJA1100
                       distinguishes three wake-up sources:
                6.5.1 Remote wake-up
                       In Standby and Sleep modes, any Ethernet activity on the MDI (idle pulses or Ethernet
                       frames) triggers a remote wake-up.
                6.5.2 Local wake-up
                       In Standby, Sleep Request and Sleep modes, a falling edge on pin WAKE (provided
                       configuration bit LED_ENABLE = 0) triggers a local wake-up.
                6.5.3 Wake-up by data detection
                       In Sleep Request mode, any Ethernet frame detected at the MDI or MII triggers wake-up
                       by data detection.
                   6.6 Autonomous operation
                       If the PHY is configured for autonomous operation (either via pin strapping, see
                       Section 6.11, or via bit AUTO_OP in Configuration register 1, see Table 20), the TJA1100
                       can operate and establish a link without further interaction with a host controller. On
                       power-on or wake-up from Sleep mode, the TJA1100 goes directly to Normal mode once
                       all supply voltages are available and the link-up process starts automatically. AUTO_OP
                       must be reset when link or mode control are configured by the Host.
                   6.7 Autonomous power-down
                       If autonomous power-down is enabled via Configuration register 1 (AUTO_PWD = 1), the
                       TJA1100 goes to Sleep Request mode automatically if no Ethernet frames have been
                       received at the MDI and MII for the time-out time, tto(pd)autn.
                   6.8 Transmitter amplitude
                       Power can be saved by adapting the amplitude of the transmitter output to the specific
                       needs of a link. For example, a short link of up to 2 m does not need to operate on the
                       same transmitter amplitude as a link of 15 m to achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio.
                       The nominal transmitter output amplitude can be selected via bit TX_AMPLITUDE (see
                       Table 20). The default value of 1000 mV can support a link of up to 15 m, while the lower
                       values of 500 mV and 750 mV may be sufficient for shorter links of up to 2 m. The
                       compliance, interoperability and EMC tests are performed at the default amplitude.

                                                                                                   100BASE-T1 PHY for Automotive Ethernet
                   6.9 Test modes
                       Five test modes are supported. Only test modes 1, 2, 4 and 5 are included in 100BASE-T1
                       [Ref. 2]. The test modes can be individually selected via an SMI command in Normal
                       mode while link control is disabled. The EN pin is used as a clock output in test modes
                       that need a reference clock. The normal EN function is disabled in test modes.
                6.9.1 Test mode 1
                       Test mode 1 is for testing the transmitter droop. In Test mode 1, the PHY transmits ‘+1’
                       symbols for 600 ns followed by ‘1’ symbols for a further 600 ns. This sequence is
                       repeated continuously.
                6.9.2 Test mode 2
                       Test mode 2 is for testing the transmitter timing jitter in Master configuration. In test
                       mode 2, the PHY transmits the data symbol sequence {+1, -1} repeatedly. The
                       transmission of the symbols is synchronized with the local external oscillator.
                6.9.3 Test mode 3
                       Test mode 3 is for testing the transmitter timing jitter in Slave configuration. In test mode 3,
                       the PHY transmits the data symbol sequence {+1, -1} repeatedly. The transmission of the
                       symbols is synchronized with the recovered receiver clock.
                6.9.4 Test mode 4
                       Test mode 4 is for testing the transmitter distortion. In test mode 4, the PHY transmits the
                       sequence of symbols generated by the scrambler polynomial gs1 = 1 + x9 + x11.
                       The bit sequence x0n, x1n is derived from the scrambler according to the following
                       equations:
                       x0n = Scrn  0 
                        x1n = Scrn  1  XOR Scrn  4 
                       This stream of 3-bit nibbles is mapped to a stream of ternary symbols according to
                       Table 8.

                        0                                              1                                           +1
                        1                                              0                                           0

                6.9.5 Test mode 5
                       Test mode 5 is for testing the transmit PSD mask. In test mode 5, the PHY transmits a
                       random sequence of PAM-3 symbols.
                6.9.6 Slave jitter test
                       Selecting the 100BASE-T1 Slave jitter test (SLAVE_JITTER_TEST = 1; see Table 19) in
                       Normal mode with LINK_CONTROL = 1 feeds the transmitter reference clock to pin EN.
                       The normal EN function is disabled in this mode.

                                                                                                   100BASE-T1 PHY for Automotive Ethernet
                6.10 Error diagnosis
               6.10.1 Undervoltage detection
                      Like state-of-the-art CAN and FlexRay transceivers, the TJA1100 monitors the status of
                      the supply voltages continuously. Once a supply voltage drops below the specified
                      minimum operating voltage, the TJA1100 enters the fail-silent Standby mode and
                      communication is halted. A UV_ERR interrupt is generated and the source of the
                      undervoltage (VDDA(1V8), VDDD(1V8) or VDDA(3V3)) is indicated in the External status register
                      (Table 27). The under-voltage detection/recovery range is positioned immediately next to
                      the operating range, without a gap. Since parameters are specified down to the min. value
                      of the under-voltage detection threshold, it is guaranteed that the behavior of the TJA1100
                      is fully specified and defined for all possible voltage condition on the supply pins.
               6.10.2 Cabling errors
                      The TJA1100 can detect open and short circuits between the twisted-pair bus lines when
                      neither of the link partners is transmitting (link control disabled). It may make sense to run
                      the diagnostic before establishing the Ethernet link. When bit CABLE_TEST in the
                      Extended Control register (Table 19) is set to 1, test pulses are transmitted onto the
                      transmission medium with a repetition rate of 666.6 kHz. The TJA1100 evaluates the
                      reflected signals and uses impedance mismatch data along the channel to determine the
                      quality of the link. The results of the cable test are available in the External status register
                      (Table 27) within tto(cbl_tst). The tests performed and associated results are summarized in
                      Table 9.

               6.10.3 Link stability
                      The signal-to-noise ratio is the parameter used to estimate link stability. The PMA Receive
                      function monitors the signal-to-noise ratio continuously. Once the signal-to-noise ratio falls
                      below a configurable threshold (SQI_FAILLIMIT), the link status is set to FAIL and
                      communication is interrupted. The TJA1100 allows for adjusting the sensitivity of the PMA
                      Receive function by configuring this threshold. The microcontroller can always check the
                      current value of the signal-to-noise ratio via the SMI, allowing it to track a possible
                      degradation in link stability.

                                                                                                    100BASE-T1 PHY for Automotive Ethernet
               6.10.4 Link-fail counter
                       High losses and/or a noisy channel may cause the link to shut down when reception is no
                       longer reliable. In such cases, a LINK_STATUS_FAIL interrupt is generated by the PHY.
                       Retraining of the link begins automatically provided link control is enabled
                       (LINK_CONTROL = 1).
                       LOC_RCVR_COUNTER and REM_RCVR_COUNTER in the Link-fail counter register
                       (Table 28) are incremented after every link fail event. Both counters are reset when this
                       register is read.
               6.10.5 Jabber detection
                       The Jabber detection function prevents the PHY being locked in the DATA state of the
                       PCS Receive state diagram when the End-of-Stream Delimiters, ESD1 and ESD2, are not
                       detected. The maximum time the PHY can reside in the DATA state is limited to tto(PCS-RX)
                       (rcv_max_timer in 100BASE-T1; [Ref. 2]). After this time, the PCS-RX state machine is
                       reset and a transition to PHY Idle state is triggered.
               6.10.6 Polarity detection
                       When the TJA1100 is in Slave configuration, it can detect when the ternary symbols sent
                       from the Master PHY are received with the wrong polarity. A polarity error would occur if
                       the two signal wires of the UTP cable were mixed up at the Slave node connection. If the
                       TJA1100 detects a polarity error in the Slave, it will correct it internally while setting the
                       POLARITY_DETECT bit in the External status register (Table 27).
               6.10.7 Interleave detection
                       A 100BASE-T1 PHY can send two different interleave sequences of ternary symbols,
                       (TAn, TBn) or (TBn, TAn). The receiver in the TJA1100 is able to de-interleave both
                       sequences. The order of the ternary symbols detected by the receiver is indicated by the
                       INTERLEAVE_DETECT bit in the External status register (Table 27).
               6.10.8 Loopback modes
                       The TJA1100 supports three loopback modes:
                         • Internal loopback (PCS loopback in accordance with 100BASE-T1)
                         • External loopback
                         • Remote loopback
              6.10.8.1 Internal loopback
                       In Internal loopback mode, the PCS Receive function gets the ternary symbols An and Bn
                       directly from the PCS Transmit function as shown in Figure 9. This action allows the MAC
                       to compare packets sent through the MII transmit function with packets received from the
                       MII receive function and, therefore, to validate the functionality of the 100BASE-T1 PCS
                       function.

                           In external loopback mode, the PMA Receive function receives signals directly from the
                           PMA Transmit function as shown in Figure 10. This external loopback test allows the MAC
                           to compare packets sent through the MII transmit function with packets received from the
                           MII receive function and, therefore, to validate the functionality of the 100BASE-T1 PCS

             6.10.8.3      Remote loopback
                           In Remote loopback mode, the packet received by the link partner at the MDI is passed
                           through the PMA Receive and PCS Receive functions and forwarded to the PCS Transmit
                           functions, which in turn sends it back to the link partner from where it came. The PCS
                           receive data is made available at the MII. Remote loopback allows the MAC to compare
                           the packets sent to the MDI with the packets received back from the MDI and thus to
                           validate the functionality of the physical channel, including both 100BASE-T1 PHYs. To
                           run the PHY in a loopback mode, the LOOPBACK control bit in the Basic control register
                           should be set before enabling link control.

                                                                                                  100BASE-T1 PHY for Automotive Ethernet
                 6.11 Auto-configuration of the PHY during power-up via pin strapping
                      The logic levels on inputs PHYAD0, PHYAD1 and CONFIG0 to CONFIG3 determine the
                      default configuration of the PHY at power-up or after a hardware reset. Pin strapping
                      occurs during the power-on settling time (ts(pon)), once all voltages (including 1V8) are
                      available.
                      Pin strapping at pins 23 (PHYAD1) and 24 (PHYAD0) determine bits 1 and 0, respectively,
                      of the PHY address used for the SMI address/Cipher scrambler. The PHY address cannot
                      be changed once the PHY has been configured. Besides the address configured via pin
                      strapping, the TJA1100 can always be accessed via address 0.

11. Application information
                   The MDI interface connects the PHY to the twisted pair cable and consists of the following
                   elements, illustrated from left to right in Figure 17:
                     •   low-pass filter
                     •   ESD protection
                     •   common-mode choke
                     •   capacitive coupling
                     •   common-mode termination (optional)
                     •   connector head/plug
                   Minimum requirements for these components are shown. Robustness requirements
                   depend on the application. Further information can be found in the TJA1100 application
                   hints [Ref. 1].
                   The MDI interface acts as termination for the transmission line of the balanced 100 
                   cable. Any deviation from the nominal 100  at the MDI interface will cause a portion of
                   the incoming signal to be reflected. The amount of reflected signal is measured by the
                   Return Loss parameter (over frequency) and must not exceed the limits specified in
                   100BASE-T1 [Ref. 2].

                   It is advised to use a PESD2ETH diode to protect against shorts to bus lines greater than
                   5 V. The supply terminal of the diode should be connected to a 3.3 V domain that is
                   available when the TJA1100 is active. The diode layout should be symmetrical, as shown
                   in the routing scheme example in Figure 18.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 20) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 33 and 34

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 20.
