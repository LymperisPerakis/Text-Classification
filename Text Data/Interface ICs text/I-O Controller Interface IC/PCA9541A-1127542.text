1. General description
             The PCA9541A is a 2-to-1 I2C-bus master selector designed for high reliability dual
             master I2C-bus applications where system operation is required, even when one master
             fails or the controller card is removed for maintenance. The two masters (for example,
             primary and back-up) are located on separate I2C-buses that connect to the same
             downstream I2C-bus slave devices. I2C-bus commands are sent by either I2C-bus master
             and are used to select one master at a time. Either master at any time can gain control of
             the slave devices if the other master is disabled or removed from the system. The failed
             master is isolated from the system and does not affect communication between the
             on-line master and the slave devices on the downstream I2C-bus.
             Two versions are offered for different architectures. PCA9541A/01 with channel 0
             selected at start-up, and PCA9541A/03 with no channel selected after start-up.
             The interrupt outputs are used to provide an indication of which master has control of the
             bus. One interrupt input (INT_IN) collects downstream information and propagates it to
             the 2 upstream I2C-buses (INT0 and INT1) if enabled. INT0 and INT1 are also used to let
             the previous bus master know that it is not in control of the bus anymore and to indicate
             the completion of the bus recovery/initialization sequence. If the masking option is set,
             those interrupts can be disabled and do not generate an interrupt.
             A bus recovery/initialization if enabled sends nine clock pulses, a not acknowledge, and a
             STOP condition in order to set the downstream I2C-bus devices to an initialized state
             before actually switching the channel to the selected master.
             An interrupt is sent to the upstream channel when the recovery/initialization procedure is
             completed.
             An internal bus sensor senses the downstream I2C-bus traffic and generates an interrupt
             if a channel switch occurs during a non-idle bus condition. This function is enabled when
             the PCA9541A recovery/initialization is not used. The interrupt signal informs the master
             that an external I2C-bus recovery/initialization must be performed. It can be disabled and
             an interrupt is not generated.
             The pass gates of the switches are constructed such that the VDD pin can be used to limit
             the maximum high voltage, which will be passed by the PCA9541A. This allows the use of
             different bus voltages on each pair, so that 1.8 V, 2.5 V, or 3.3 V devices can communicate
             with 5 V devices without any additional protection.
             The PCA9541A does not isolate the capacitive loading on either side of the device, so the
             designer must take into account all trace and device capacitances on both sides of the
             device, and pull-up resistors must be used on all channels.
             External pull-up resistors pull the bus to the desired voltage level for each channel. All I/O
             pins are 6.0 V tolerant.

                                                         2-to-1 I2C-bus master selector with interrupt logic and reset
                   An active LOW reset input allows the PCA9541A to be initialized. Pulling the RESET pin
                   LOW resets the I2C-bus state machine and configures the device to its default state as
                   does the internal Power-On Reset (POR) function.

                            and board-level performance, the exposed pad must be soldered to the board using a corresponding
                            thermal pad on the board, and for proper heat conduction through the board thermal vias must be
                            incorporated in the printed-circuit board in the thermal pad region.

                       Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA9541A”.
                   7.1 Device address
                       Following a START condition, the upstream master that wants to control the I2C-bus or
                       make a status check must send the address of the slave it is accessing. The slave
                       address of the PCA9541A is shown in Figure 5. To conserve power, no internal pull-up
                       resistors are incorporated on the hardware selectable pins and they must be pulled HIGH
                       or LOW.

                       logic 1 a read is selected, while logic 0 selects a write operation.
                       Remark: Reserved I2C-bus addresses must be used with caution since they can interfere
                       with:
                         • ‘reserved for future use’ I2C-bus addresses (1111 1XX)
                         • slave devices that use the 10-bit addressing scheme (1111 0XX)
                   7.2 Command Code
                       Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address, the bus master sends a
                       byte to the PCA9541A, which is stored in the Command Code register.
                                                                       0      0       0       AI       0       0    B1    B0

                                                                                                                    002aab391
                         Fig 6.   Command Code
                       The 2 LSBs are used as a pointer to determine which register is accessed.
                       If the auto-increment flag is set (AI = 1), the two least significant bits of the Command
                       Code are automatically incremented after a byte has been read or written. This allows the
                       user to program the registers sequentially or to read them sequentially.
                         • During a read operation, the contents of these bits will roll over to 00b after the last
                            allowed register is accessed (10b).
                         • During a write operation, the PCA9541A acknowledges bytes sent to the IE and
                            CONTROL registers, but does not acknowledge a byte sent to the Interrupt Status
                            Register since it is a read-only register. The 2 LSBs of the Command Code do not roll
                            over to 00b but stay at 10b.
                       Only the 2 least significant bits are affected by the AI flag.
                       Unused bits must be programmed with zeros. Any command code (write operation)
                       different from ‘000AI 0000’, ‘000AI 0001’, and ‘000AI 0010’ are not acknowledged. At
                       power-up, this register defaults to all zeros.

                       Each system master controls its own set of registers, however they can also read specific
                       bits from the other system master.

                   7.3 Interrupt Enable and Control registers description
                       When a master seeks control of the bus by connecting its I2C-bus channel to the
                       PCA9541A downstream channel, it has to write to the CONTROL register (Reg#01).
                       Bits MYBUS and BUSON allow the master to take control of the bus.
                       The MYBUS and the NMYBUS bits determine which master has control of the bus.
                       Table 9 explains which master gets control of the bus and how. There is no arbitration.
                       Any master can take control of the bus when it wants regardless of whether the other
                       master is using it or not.
                       The BUSON and the NBUSON bits determine whether the upstream bus is connected or
                       disconnected to/from the downstream bus. Table 10 explains when the upstream bus is
                       connected or disconnected.
                       Internally, the state machine does the following:
                         • If the combination of the BUSON and the NBUSON bits causes the upstream to be
                            disconnected from the downstream bus, then that is done. So in this case, the values
                            of the MYBUS and the NMYBUS do not matter.
                         • If a master was connected to the downstream bus prior to the disconnect, then an
                            interrupt is sent on the respective interrupt output in an attempt to let that master know
                            that it is no longer connected to the downstream bus. This is indicated by setting the
                            BUSLOST bit in the Interrupt Status Register.
                         • If the combination of the BUSON and the NBUSON bits causes a master to be
                            connected to the downstream bus and if there is no change in the BUSON bits since
                            when the disconnect took effect, then the master requesting the bus is connected to
                            the downstream bus. If it requests a bus initialization sequence, then it is performed.
                         • If there is no change in the combination of the BUSON and the NBUSON bits and a
                            new master wants the bus, then the downstream bus is disconnected from the old
                            master that was using it and the new master gets control of it. Again, the bus
                            initialization if requested is done. The appropriate interrupt signals are generated.
                       After a master has sent the bus control request:
                        1. The previous master is disconnected from the I2C-bus. An interrupt to the previous
                            master is sent through its INT line to let it know that it lost control of the bus.
                            BUSLOST bit in the Interrupt Status Register is set. This interrupt can be masked by
                            setting the BUSLOSTMSK bit to logic 1.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                      PCA9541A
                                                           2-to-1 I2C-bus master selector with interrupt logic and reset
                     2. A built-in bus initialization/recovery function can take temporary control of the
                         downstream channel to initialize the bus before making the actual switch to the new
                         bus master. This function is activated by setting the BUSINIT to logic 1 by the master
                         during the same write sequence as the one programming MYBUS and BUSON bits.
                         When activated and whether the bus was previously idle or not:
                         a. 9 clock pulses are sent on the SCL_SLAVE.
                         b. SDA_SLAVE line is released (HIGH) when the clock pulses are sent to
                            SCL_SLAVE. This is equivalent to sending 8 data bits and a not acknowledge.
                         c. Finally a STOP condition is sent to the downstream slave channel.
                         This sequence completes any read transaction which was previously in process and
                         the downstream slave configured as a slave-transmitter should release the SDA line
                         because the PCA9541A did not acknowledge the last byte.
                     3. When the initialization has been requested and completed, the PCA9541A sends an
                         interrupt to the new master through its INT line and connects the new master to the
                         downstream channel. BUSINIT bit in the Interrupt Status Register is set. The switch
                         operation occurs after the master asking the bus control has sent a STOP
                         command. This interrupt can be masked by setting the BUSINITMSK bit to logic 1.
                     4. When the bus initialization/recovery function has not been requested (BUSINIT = 0),
                         the PCA9541A connects the new master to the slave downstream channel. The
                         switch operation occurs after the master asking the bus control has sent a
                         STOP command. If the built-in bus sensor function detects a non-idle condition in the
                         downstream slave channel at the switching time, PCA9541A sends an interrupt to the
                         new master through its INT line. BUSOK bit in the Interrupt Status Register is set. This
                         means that a STOP condition has not been detected in the previous bus
                         communication and that an external bus recovery/initialization must be performed. If
                         an idle condition has been detected at the switching time, no interrupt is sent. This
                         interrupt can be masked by setting the BUSOKMSK bit to logic 1.
                   Interrupt status can be read. See Section 7.4 “Interrupt Status registers” for more
                   information.
                   The MYTEST and the NMYTEST bits cause the interrupt pins of the respective masters to
                   be activated for a ‘functional interrupt test’.
                   Remark: The regular way to proceed is that a master asks to take the control of the bus
                   by programming MYBUS and BUSON bits based on NMUYBUS and NBUSON values.
                   Nevertheless, the same master can also decide to give up the control of the bus and give
                   it to the other master. This is also done by programming the MYBUS and BUSON bits
                   based on NMYBUS and NBUSON values.
                   Remark: Any writes either to the Interrupt Enable Register or the Control Register cause
                   the respective register to be updated on the ninth clock cycle, that is, on the rising edge of
                   the acknowledge clock cycle.
                   Remark: The actual switch from one channel to another or the switching off of both the
                   channels happens on a STOP command that is sent by the master requesting the switch.

                              This register allows a master to read and/or write (if needed) Mask options for its own
                              channel.
                              The Interrupt Enable register described below is identical for both the masters.
                              Nevertheless, there are physically 2 internal Interrupt Enable registers, one for each
                              upstream channel. When Master 0 reads/writes in this register, the internal Interrupt
                              Enable Register 0 is accessed. When Master 1 reads/writes in this register, the internal
                              Interrupt Enable Register 1 is accessed.

                              The Control Register described below is identical for both the masters. Nevertheless,
                              there are physically 2 internal Control Registers, one for each upstream channel.
                              When master 0 reads/writes in this register, the internal Control Register 0 is accessed.
                              When master 1 reads/writes in this register, the internal Control Register 1 is accessed.

                        [1]   BUSON and NBUSON is an exclusive-OR type function where:
                              Equal values (00b or 11b) means that the connection between the upstream and the downstream channels
                              is off.
                              Different values (01b or 10b) means that the connection between the upstream and the downstream
                              channels is on.
                        Switch to the new channel is done when the master initiating the switch request sends a
                        STOP command to the PCA9541A.
                        If either master wants to change the connection of the downstream channel, it must write
                        to its Control Register (Reg#01), and then send a STOP command because an update
                        of the connection to the downstream according to the values in the two internal Control
                        Registers happens only on a STOP command. Writing to one control register followed by
                        a STOP condition on the other master's channel does not cause an update to the
                        downstream connection.
                        When both masters request a switch to their own channel at the same time, the master
                        who last wrote to its Control Register before the PCA9541A receives a STOP command
                        wins the switching sequence. There is no arbitration performed.

                   ‘I2C-bus on’ means that upstream and downstream channels are connected together.
                   Remark: Only the 4 LSBs of the Control Register are described in Table 12 since only
                   those bits control the I2C-bus control. The logic value for the 4 MSBs is specific to the
                   application and are not discussed in the table.
                   The read sequence is performed by the master as:
                   S - 111xxxx0 - 000x0001 - Sr - 111xxxx1 - DataRead - P
                   The write sequence is performed by the master as:
                   S - 111xxxx0 - 000x0001 - DataWritten - P

                   7.4 Interrupt Status registers
                       The PCA9541A provides 4 different types of interrupt:
                         • To indicate to the former I2C-bus master that it is not in control of the bus anymore
                         • To indicate to the new I2C-bus master that:
                            – The bus recovery/initialization has been performed and that the downstream
                               channel connection has been done (built-in bus recovery/initialization active).
                            – A ‘bus not well initialized’ condition has been detected by the PCA9541A when the
                               switch has been done (built-in bus recovery/initialization not active). This
                               information can be used by the new master to initiate its own bus
                               recovery/initialization sequence.
                         • Indicate to both I2C-bus upstream masters that a downstream interrupt has been
                            generated through the INT_IN pin.

                       When an upstream master takes control of the I2C-bus while the other channel was using
                       the downstream channel, an interrupt is generated to the master losing control of the bus
                       (INT line goes LOW to let the master know that it lost the control of the bus) immediately
                       after disconnection from the downstream channel.
                       By setting the BUSLOSTMSK bit to ‘1’, the interrupt is masked and the upstream master
                       that lost the I2C-bus control does not receive an interrupt (INT line does not go LOW).
                7.4.2 Recovery/initialization interrupt
                       Before switching to a new upstream channel, an automatic bus recovery/initialization can
                       be performed by the PCA9541A. This function is requested by setting the BUSINIT bit to
                       ‘1’. When the downstream bus has been initialized, an interrupt to the new master is
                       generated (INT line goes LOW).
                       By setting the BUSINITMSK bit to ‘1’, the interrupt is masked and the new master does
                       not receive an interrupt (INT line does not go LOW).
                       When the automatic bus recovery/initialization is not requested, if the built-in bus sensor
                       function (sensing permanently the downstream I2C-bus traffic) detects a non-idle
                       condition (previous bus channel connected to the downstream slave channel, was
                       between a START and STOP condition), then an interrupt to the new master is sent (INT
                       line goes LOW). This interrupt tells the new master that an external bus
                       recovery/initialization must be performed. By setting the BUSOKMSK bit to ‘1’, the
                       interrupt is masked and the new master does not receive an interrupt (INT line does not
                       go LOW).
                       Remark: In this particular situation, after the switch to the new master is performed,
                       a read of the Interrupt Status Register is not possible if the switch happened in the
                       middle of a read sequence because the new master does not have control of the SDA
                       line.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                             PCA9541A
                                                                2-to-1 I2C-bus master selector with interrupt logic and reset
                 7.4.3 Downstream interrupt
                          An interrupt can also be generated by a downstream device by asserting the INT_IN pin
                          LOW. When INT_IN is asserted LOW, and if both INTINMSK bits are not set to ‘1’ by
                          either master, INT0 and INT1 both go LOW.
                          By setting the INTINMSK bit to ‘1’ by a master and/or the INTINMSK bit to ‘1’ by the other
                          master, the interrupts are masked and the corresponding masked channels do not receive
                          an interrupt (INT0 and/or INT1 line does not go LOW).
                 7.4.4 Functional test interrupt
                          A master can send an interrupt to itself to test its own INT wire or send an interrupt to the
                          other master to test its INT line. This is done by:
                            • setting the TESTON bit to ‘1’ to test its own INT line
                            • setting the NTESTON bit to ‘1’ to test the other master INT line
                          Setting the TESTON and/or NTESTON bits to ‘0’ by a master clears the interrupts.
                          Remark: Interrupt outputs have an open-drain structure. Interrupt input does not have any
                          internal pull-up resistor and must not be left floating (that is, pulled HIGH to VDD through
                          resistor) in order to avoid any undesired interrupt conditions.
                 7.4.5 Register 2: Interrupt Status Register (B1:B0 = 10b)
                          The Interrupt Status Register for both the masters is identical and is described below.
                          Nevertheless, there are physically 2 internal Interrupt Registers, one for each upstream
                          channel.
                          When Master 0 reads this register, the internal Interrupt Register 0 is accessed.
                          When Master 1 reads this register, the internal Interrupt Register 1 is accessed.

[1]   Default values are the same for PCA9541A/01 and PCA9541A/03.
[2]   Reading the Interrupt Status Register does not clear the MYTEST, NMYTEST or the INTIN bits. They are cleared if:
      INT_IN line goes HIGH for INTIN bit
      TESTON bit is cleared for MYTEST bit
      NTESTON bit is cleared for NMYTEST bit
[3]   Interrupt on a master is cleared after TESTON bit is cleared by the same master or NTESTON bit is cleared by the other master.
[4]   BUSINIT, BUSOK and BUSLOST bits in the Interrupt Status Register get cleared after a read of the same register is done. Precisely, the
      register gets cleared on the second clock pulse during the read operation.
[5]   If the interrupt condition remains on INT_IN after the read sequence, another interrupt will be generated (if the interrupt has not been
      masked).
                        7.5 Power-on reset
                                When power is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9541A in a reset
                                condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At this point, the reset condition is released and the
                                internal registers are initialized to their default states, with:
                                  • PCA9541A/01: default Channel 0 (no STOP detect)
                                     After power-up and/or insertion of the device in the main I2C-bus, the upstream
                                     Channel 0 and the downstream slave channel are connected together.
                                  • PCA9541A/03: default ‘no channel’ (no STOP detect)
                                     After power-up and/or insertion of the device in the main I2C-bus, no channel will be
                                     connected to the downstream channel. The device is ready to receive a START
                                     condition and its address by a master.
                                     If either register writes to its Control Register, then the connection between the
                                     upstream and the downstream channels is determined by the values on the Control
                                     Registers.
                                Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V for at least 5 s in order to reset the device.

                   7.6 External reset
                       A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst)L.
                       The PCA9541A registers and I2C-bus state machine are held in their default states until
                       the RESET input is once again HIGH. This input typically requires a pull-up resistor to
                       VDD.
                       Default states are:
                         • I2C-bus upstream Channel 0 connected to the I2C-bus downstream channel for the
                            PCA9541A/01
                         • no I2C-bus upstream channel connected to the I2C-bus downstream channel for the
                            PCA9541A/03.
                   7.7 Voltage translation
                       The pass gate transistors of the PCA9541A are constructed such that the VDD voltage can
                       be used to limit the maximum voltage that is passed from one I2C-bus to another.
                                                                                                                         002aaa964

                         Fig 8.   Pass gate voltage as a function of supply voltage
                       Figure 8 shows the voltage characteristics of the pass gate transistors (note that the graph
                       was generated using the data specified in Section 12 “Static characteristics” of this data
                       sheet). In order for the PCA9541A to act as a voltage translator, the Vo(sw) voltage should
                       be equal to, or lower than the lowest bus voltage. For example, if the main buses were
                       running at 5 V, and the downstream bus was 3.3 V, then Vo(sw) should be equal to or
                       below 3.3 V to effectively clamp the downstream bus voltages. Looking at Figure 8, we
                       see that Vo(sw)(max) is at 3.3 V when the PCA9541A supply voltage is 4.0 V or lower so the
                       PCA9541A supply voltage could be set to 3.3 V. Pull-up resistors can then be used to

8. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       are interpreted as control signals (see Figure 9).

                   8.2 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line, while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S).
                       A LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the
                       STOP condition (P) (see Figure 10).

                   8.3 System configuration
                         A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’, a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                         device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                         the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 11).

                   8.4 Acknowledge
                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of 8 bits is followed by one acknowledge
                         bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter, whereas the
                         master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                         A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                         each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                         that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                         pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                         LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up and hold
                         times must be taken into account.
                         A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                         acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                         transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                         condition.

                   9.1 Specific applications
                       The PCA9541A is a 2-to-1 I2C-bus master selector designed for dual master, high
                       reliability I2C-bus applications, where continuous maintenance and control monitoring is
                       required even if one master fails or its controller card is removed for maintenance. The
                       PCA9541A can also be used in other applications, such as where masters share the
                       same resource but cannot share the same bus, as a gatekeeper multiplexer in long single
                       bus applications or as a bus initialization/recovery device.

                     9.2 High reliability systems
                         In a typical multipoint application, shown in Figure 18, the two masters (for example,
                         primary and back-up) are located on separate I2C-buses that connect to multiple
                         downstream I2C-bus slave cards/devices via a PCA9541A/01 for non-hot swap

                         I2C-bus commands are sent via the primary or back-up master and either master can take
                         command of the I2C-bus. Either master at any time can gain control of the slave devices if
                         the other master is disabled or removed from the system. The failed master is isolated
                         from the system and does not affect communication between the on-line master and the
                         slave devices located on the cards.
                         For even higher reliability in multipoint backplane applications, two dedicated masters can
                         be used for every card as shown in Figure 19.

                   9.3 Masters with shared resources
                       Some masters may not be multi-master capable or some masters may not work well
                       together and continually lock up the bus. The PCA9541A can be used to separate the
                       masters, as shown in Figure 20, but still allow shared access to slave devices, such as
                       Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) EEPROMs or temperature sensors.

                   9.4 Gatekeeper multiplexer
                       The PCA9541A/03 can act as a gatekeeper multiplexer in applications where there are
                       multiple I2C-bus devices with the same fixed address (for example, EEPROMs with
                       address of ‘Z’ as shown in Figure 21) connected in a multipoint arrangement to the same
                       I2C-bus. Up to 16 hot swappable cards/devices can be multiplexed to the same bus
                       master by using one PCA9541A/03 per card/device. Since each PCA9541A/03 has its
                       own unique address (for example, ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and so on), the EEPROMs can be
                       connected to the master, one at a time, by connecting one PCA9541A/03 (Master 0
                       position) while keeping the rest of the cards/devices isolated (off position).
                       The alternative, shown with dashed lines, is to use a PCA9548 1-to-8 channel switch on
                       the master card and run 8 I2C-bus devices, one to each EEPROM card, to multiplex the
                       master to each card. The number of card pins used is the same in either case, but there
                       are 7 fewer pairs of SDA/SCL traces on the printed-circuit board if the PCA9541A/03 is
                       used.

                         and Slave 2 in Figure 22) can be isolated from the master by the PCA9541A/03. The
                         PCA9541A/03 disconnects the bus when it is reset via the hardware reset line, restoring
                         the master's control of the rest of the bus (for example, Slave 0). The bus master can then
                         command the PCA9541A/03 to send 9 clock pulses/STOP condition to reset the
                         downstream I2C-bus devices before they are reconnected to the master or leave the
                         downstream devices isolated.

[1]   Pass gate propagation delay is calculated from the 20  typical Ron and the 15 pF load capacitance.
[2]   After this period, the first clock pulse is generated.
[3]   A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIH(min) of the SCL signal) in order to
      bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.

16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                16.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                             PCA9541A

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 30) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 19 and 20

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 30.
