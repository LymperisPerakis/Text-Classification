CP2130
1. System Overview
The CP2130 is a highly-integrated USB-to-SPI bridge controller providing a simple solution for bridging a Universal
Serial Bus (USB) host to a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus using a minimum of components and PCB space.
The CP2130 includes a USB 2.0 full-speed controller, USB transceiver, oscillator, one-time programmable (OTP)
ROM, and a SPI controller in a compact 4 x 4 mm QFN24 package (sometimes called “MLF” or “MLP”).
The on-chip, OTP ROM provides the option to customize the USB Vendor ID, Product ID, Manufacturer String,
Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, Device Serial Number, and GPIO
configuration as desired for OEM applications.
The CP2130 uses a Silicon Labs vendor-specific USB protocol using control and bulk transfers which is supported
by most operating systems through the use of generic USB drivers and interface libraries. A custom driver typically
does not need to be developed for this device. Windows applications communicate with the CP2130 through a
Windows DLL which is provided by Silicon Labs that communicates with the Microsoft WinUSB driver via a
WinUSB DLL. The interface specification for the CP2130 is also available to enable development of an API for any
operating system that supports control and bulk transfers over USB.
The CP2130 SPI implements the standard signals, including SCK, MISO, MOSI, CS, as well as a ready-to-read
(RTR) hardware handshaking input, so existing system firmware does not need to be modified. The SPI
capabilities of the CP2130 include fixed SPI clock rates ranging from 93.75 kHz to 12 MHz, configurable clock
phase, configurable clock polarity, adjustable SPI delays, and up to 11 configurable chip select signals.
Any of the multi-purpose pins not used as chip select signals may instead be used as GPIO signals that are user-
defined. The GPIO signals may also be configured to initiate a USB remote wakeup event on GPIO state change,
which allows the CP2130 to wake a USB host from sleep mode. Eight of the GPIO signals support alternate
features including ready-to-read (RTR) handshaking, a configurable event counter, a configurable clock output
(93.75 kHz to 24 MHz), SPI activity LED toggle, and USB suspend indicators. Support for I/O interface voltages
down to 1.8 V is provided via a VIO pin.
An evaluation kit for the CP2130 (Part Number: CP2130EK) is available. It includes a CP2130-based USB-to-SPI
evaluation board with SPI slave devices such as an EEPROM and ADC as well as connections for an external
CP2400 LCD controller EVB and SPI monitor. The kit also includes a Windows DLL and test application, USB
cables, and full documentation. See www.silabs.com for the latest application notes and product support
information for the CP2130. Contact a Silicon Labs sales representatives or go to www.silabs.com to order the

 Notes:
    1. Thermal resistance assumes a multi-layer PCB with any exposed pad soldered to a PCB pad.
    2. USB Pull-up current should be added for total supply current. USB normal and suspended supply current is current
        flowing into VREGIN. USB normal and suspended supply current is guaranteed by characterization.
    3. The USB Pull-up supply current values are calculated values based on USB specifications. USB Pull-up supply current
        is current flowing from VDD to GND through USB pull-down/pull-up resistors on D+ and D-.

3. USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) function controller in the CP2130 is a USB 2.0-compliant, full-speed device with
integrated transceiver and on-chip matching and pullup resistors. The USB function controller manages all data
transfers between the USB and the SPI bus as well as command requests generated by the USB host and
commands for controlling the function of the SPI and GPIO pins.
The USB Suspend and Resume modes are supported for power management of both the CP2130 device as well
as external circuitry. The CP2130 enters Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. Upon
entering Suspend mode, the Suspend signals are asserted. The Suspend signals are also asserted after a CP2130
reset until device configuration and USB Enumeration is complete. SUSPEND is logic high when the device is in
the Suspend state, and logic low when the device is in normal mode. The SUSPEND pin has the opposite logic
value of the SUSPEND pin.
The CP2130 exits Suspend mode when any of the following occur: Resume signaling is detected or generated, a
USB Reset signal is detected, the configured GPIO wakeup sources do not match the configured latch value, or a
device reset occurs. SUSPEND and SUSPEND are weakly pulled to VIO in a high impedance state during a
CP2130 reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong pulldown (10 k) can be used to ensure SUSPEND remains
low during reset.
The CP2130 can be configured to use any of the GPIO pins as a remote wakeup source. While suspended, if any
of the pins configured as a wakeup source does not match the configured wakeup match value, then the CP2130
will send remote wakeup signaling to the USB host. If the host has configured the CP2130 to enable remote
wakeup, then the host will send resume signaling to the CP2130 and the device will exit Suspend mode.
The logic level and output mode (push-pull or open-drain) of various pins during USB Suspend is configurable in
the OTP ROM. See Section 6 for more information.

CP2130
4. Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
The CP2130 Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) provides access to a flexible, full-duplex synchronous serial bus. The
CP2130 can operate as a master device in both 3-wire or 4-wire modes, and supports multiple slaves. Any of the
11 GPIO pins may be configured as chip select master outputs to select multiple SPI slave devices.
4.1. Signal Descriptions
The four signals used by SPI (MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS) are described below.
4.1.1. Master Out, Slave In (MOSI)
The master-out, slave-in (MOSI) signal is an output from a master device and an input to slave devices. It is used
to serially transfer data from the master to the slave. Data is transferred most-significant bit first.
4.1.2. Master In, Slave Out (MISO)
The master-in, slave-out (MISO) signal is an output from a slave device and an input to the master device. It is
used to serially transfer data from the slave to the master. Data is transferred most-significant bit first.
4.1.3. Serial Clock (SCK)
The serial clock (SCK) signal is an output from the master device and an input to slave devices. It is used to
synchronize the transfer of data between the master and slave on the MOSI and MISO lines. Since the CP2130
always acts as a SPI master, it always drives SCK.
4.1.4. Chip Select (CS0 - CS10)
The CP2130 may be used to control up to 11 different SPI slave devices using GPIO pins configured in chip select
output mode. Chip select signals are active low.
See Figure 2 and Figure 3 for typical connection diagrams of the various operational modes.

4.2. Data Throughput
SPI read and write data transfer throughput can be affected by many factors including USB host performance, host
driver and PC application performance, SPI clock rate, and data transfer size. Also USB bulk transfers are limited
by available bandwidth on the bus; increased traffic on the bus may decrease SPI throughput. Additionally, the
CP2130 can be configured to operate in high-priority write or high-priority read mode. The priority mode is
configured in the OTP ROM. The CP2130 has two independent USB endpoints used for bulk data transfers. The
first endpoint is double buffered whereas the second endpoint is single buffered. Each endpoint is used for only a
single direction. A USB IN transfer is data transferred from the device to the host. A USB OUT transfer is data
transferred from the host to the device. More information about the USB interface can be found in application note,
“AN792: CP2130 Interface Specification”. By default, the CP2130 is configured in high-priority write mode, in which
the double-buffered endpoint is used for OUT transfers and the single-buffered endpoint is used for IN transfers.
Conversely, when the CP2130 is configured in high-priority read mode, the double-buffered endpoint is used for IN
transfers and the single-buffered endpoint is used for OUT transfers.
Table 10 below shows the CP2130 typical SPI throughput in high-priority write and high-priority read modes using
a 64-bit PC.

4.3. Serial Clock Phase and Polarity
Four combinations of serial clock phase and polarity can be selected using SPI control commands over the USB
interface. The clock phase (CPHA) specifies which clock edge is used to latch the data. The clock polarity (CPOL)
selects between an active-high or active-low clock. Both master and slave devices must be configured to use the
same clock phase and polarity. The clock and data line relationships are shown in Figure 4.
The SPI clock field of the SPI control command controls the master mode serial clock frequency. The clock
frequency is restricted to discrete values between 93.8 kHz and 12 MHz.

5. GPIO Pins
The CP2130 supports 11 user-configurable GPIO pins. Each of these GPIO pins are usable as inputs, open-drain
outputs, or push-pull outputs. Each GPIO pin may also be configured for use as SPI chip select signals for up to 11
different SPI slaves. Six of these GPIO pins also have alternate functions which are listed in Table 12. More
information regarding the configuration and usage of these pins is available in application note, “AN721: CP21xx

       GPIO.5        Clock Output (Push-Pull Output)
The difference between an open-drain output and a push-pull output is evident when the GPIO output is driven to
logic high. A logic high, open-drain output pulls the pin to the VIO rail through an internal, pull-up resistor. A logic
high, push-pull output directly drives the pin to the VIO voltage. Open-drain outputs are typically used when
interfacing to logic at a higher voltage than the VIO pin. These pins can be safely pulled to the higher, external
voltage through an external pull-up resistor. The maximum external pull-up voltage is 5 V.
The speed of reading and writing the GPIO pins is subject to the timing of the USB interface and host computer.
GPIO pins configured as inputs or outputs are not recommended for real-time signaling.
The following paragraphs describe the alternate functions available on the corresponding GPIO pin.

5.1. GPIO.3—Ready-to-Read (RTR)
RTR, or Ready-to-Read, is a configurable active-low or active-high input to the CP2130 and is used by the SPI
slave device to indicate to the CP2130 when to read. When performing a Read with RTR command, the CP2130
will only read SPI data when the RTR pin is asserted.
By default, GPIO.3 is configured to operate as the RTR input pin. In addition to the GPIO OTP ROM configuration,
the device must be configured to use RTR flow control to use this pin.

5.2. GPIO.4—Event Counter
GPIO.4 is configurable as an event counter digital input pin. The event counter can be configured to count edges or
pulses. The four configurable modes are: rising edge, falling edge, positive pulse, or negative pulse. Once
configured for event counter mode, the CP2130 maintains a 16-bit counter that increments by ‘1’ whenever the
specified edge or pulse is detected. The user may query the CP2130 to get the current event count. The event
counter can be used to detect slave interrupt events by connecting the slave interrupt output pin to the CP2130
event counter pin.
5.3. GPIO.5—Clock Output
GPIO.5 is configurable to output a configurable CMOS clock output. The clock output appears at the pin at the
same time the device completes enumeration and exits USB Suspend mode. The clock output is removed from the
pin when the device enters USB Suspend mode. The output frequency is configurable through the use of a divider
and the accuracy is specified in Table 5. When the divider is set to 0, the output frequency is 93.75 kHz. For divider
values between 1 and 255, the output frequency is determined by the formula:
                                                                    24 MHz

CP2130
5.4. GPIO.8—SPI Activity Indicator
GPIO.8 is configurable as a SPI activity indicator pin. This pin is logic high when a device is not transferring data
over the SPI, and toggles at a fixed rate as specified in Table 5 when a data transfer is in progress. Typically, this
pin is connected to an LED to indicate data transfer.
                                                                               VIO

5.5. GPIO.9-10—SUSPEND and SUSPEND
GPIO.9 and GPIO.10 are configurable as active-high SUSPEND and active-low SUSPEND pins. The SUSPEND
pin is logic high when the device is in the suspended state and logic low when the device is in the active mode. The
SUSPEND pin has the opposite logic value of the SUSPEND pin.
5.6. USB Remote Wakeup
Any of the GPIO pins may be used to trigger a USB remote wakeup event. Before the CP2130 enters the Suspend
state, the device may be configured to wakeup on a port mismatch event. When any of the pins specified in the
wakeup mask do not match the pin logic value specified in the wakeup value, the CP2130 will wakeup and signal
remote wakeup on the bus. The CP2130 will assert USB remote wakeup signaling for 10 to 15 ms before the host
may respond by resuming the CP2130.
Any GPIO pin used for remote wakeup must be configured as an input during the Suspend state. GPIO pins are
selected as wakeup pins using the Wakeup Match Mask. The Wakeup Match Value specifies the logic level of the
wakeup pin. When the pin level does not match the value specified, the device will wakeup. The default Wakeup
Match Mask and Wakeup Match Value are shown in Table 15.
5.7. GPIO State During USB Suspend
All GPIO pins support programmable suspend state mode and latch values. When the CP2130 enter USB
Suspend mode and the Use Suspend Mode and Values option is set, the CP2130 will reconfigure the GPIO pins
just prior to entering USB Suspend mode. When the CP2130 resumes from USB Suspend mode, the GPIO pins
revert to the previous function configurations and modes.

6. One-Time Programmable ROM
The CP2130 includes an internal, OTP ROM that may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID
(PID), Manufacturer String, Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, Device Serial
Number, GPIO configuration, Suspend Pins and Modes as desired for OEM applications. If the OTP ROM has not
been customized, the default configuration data shown in Table 14 and Table 15 is used.

While customization of the USB configuration data is optional, customizing the VID/PID combination is strongly
recommended. A unique VID/PID will prevent the device from being recognized by any other manufacturer’s
software application. A vendor ID can be obtained from www.usb.org or Silicon Labs can provide a free PID for the
OEM product that can be used with the Silicon Labs VID at www.silabs.com/RequestPID. All CP2130 devices are
pre-programmed with a unique serial number. It is important to have a unique serial string if it is possible for
multiple CP2130 devices to be connected to the same PC.
Application note, “AN792: CP2130 Interface Specification”, includes more information about the programmable
values and their valid options. Note that certain items in the OTP ROM are programmed as a group and
programming one of the items in the group prevents further programming of any of the other items in the group.
The configuration data OTP ROM is programmable by Silicon Labs prior to shipment with the desired configuration
information. It can also be programmed in-system over the USB interface if a 4.7 µF capacitor is connected
between the VPP pin and ground. No other circuitry should be connected to VPP during a programming operation,
and VIO must remain at 3.3 V or higher to successfully write to the configuration OTP ROM.

CP2130
7. Voltage Regulator
The CP2130 includes an on-chip 5 V to 3.45 V voltage regulator. This allows the CP2130 to be configured as either
a USB bus-powered device or a USB self-powered device. A typical connection diagram of the device in a bus-
powered application using the regulator is shown in Figure 11. When enabled, the voltage regulator output appears
on the VDD pin and can be used to power external devices. See Table 4 for the voltage regulator electrical
characteristics.
Note: By default, the CP2130 is configured for bus-powered operation. The CP2130 OTP configuration must be changed if the
         device will be operated in either of the self-powered modes.
If the regulator is used to provide VDD in a self-powered application, use the same connections from Figure 11, but
connect REGIN to an on-board 5 V supply, and disconnect it from the VBUS pin. In addition, if REGIN may be
unpowered while VBUS is 5 V, a resistor divider (or functionally equivalent circuit) shown in Note 6 of Figure 12 is
required to meet the absolute maximum voltage on VBUS specification in Table 9.

     Notes:
          1. VIO can be connected directly to VDD or to a supply as low as 1.8 V to set the I/O interface voltage.
          2. USB connector shield decoupling capacitors and resistor are not required, but can be added for noise immunity.
          3. Avalanche transient voltage suppression diodes compatible with Full-speed USB should be added at the
             connector for ESD protection. Use Littelfuse p/n SP0503BAHT or equivalent.
          4. An external pull-up is not required, but can be added for noise immunity.
          5. If programming the configuration ROM via USB, add a 4.7 F capacitor between VPP and ground.
             During a programming operation, do not connect the VPP pin to other circuitry, and ensure that VIO is at least 3.3 V.

Alternatively, if 3.0 to 3.6 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2130 can function as a USB self-powered
device with the voltage regulator bypassed. For this configuration, tie the REGIN input to VDD to bypass the voltage
regulator. A typical connection diagram showing the device in a self-powered application with the regulator
bypassed is shown in Figure 12.
The USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match the device power usage and configuration. See
application note, “AN721: CP21xx Customization Guide”, for information on how to customize USB descriptors for

 Notes:
      1. VIO can be connected directly to VDD or to a supply as low as 1.8 V to set the I/O interface voltage.
      2. USB connector shield decoupling capacitors and resistor are not required, but can be added for noise immunity.
      3. Avalanche transient voltage suppression diodes compatible with Full-speed USB should be added at the
         connector for ESD protection. Use Littelfuse p/n SP0503BAHT or equivalent.
      4. An external pull-up is not required, but can be added for noise immunity.
      5. If programming the configuration ROM via USB, add a 4.7 F capacitor between VPP and ground.
         During a programming operation, do not connect the VPP pin to other circuitry, and ensure that VIO is at least 3.3 V.
      6. For self-powered systems where VDD and VIO may be unpowered when VBUS is connected to 5 V, a resistor
         divider (or functionally-equivalent circuit) on VBUS is required to meet the absolute maximum voltage on VBUS
         specification in the Electrical Characteristics section.

CP2130
8. CP2130 Interface Specification and Windows Interface DLL
The CP2130 is a Bulk Mode USB device and requires a generic USB driver such as Microsoft’s WinUSB driver or
the open-source LibUSB driver. The CP2130 uses a vendor-specific interface protocol, and so the host application
or library must comply with the CP2130 Interface Specification to communicate with the device. The low-level USB
specification for the CP2130 is provided in application note, “AN792: CP2130 Interface Specification.” This
document describes all of the basic functions for opening, reading from, writing to, and closing the device as well
as the OTP ROM programming functions.
Silicon Labs also provides an interface library that encapsulates the CP2130 interface and also adds higher level
features such as read/write time-outs. This library is the recommended interface for the CP2130. The interface
library is provided as a Windows DLL. Documentation for the interface library API is included in the installation
package.
AN792: CP2130 Interface Specification and the library are available in the CP2130EK CD as well as online at:
www.silabs.com.

       Notes:
       General
          1. All dimensions shown are in millimeters (mm) unless otherwise noted.
          2. This Land Pattern Design is based on the IPC-7351 guidelines.
       Solder Mask Design
          3. All metal pads are to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Clearance between the solder
              mask and the metal pad is to be 60 µm minimum, all the way around the pad.
       Stencil Design
          4. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be used
              to assure good solder paste release.
          5. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
          6. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for all perimeter pads.
          7. A 2 x 2 array of 1.10 x 1.10 mm openings on a 1.30 mm pitch should be used for the center
              pad.
       Card Assembly
          8. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
          9. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020 specification for Small
              Body Components.
