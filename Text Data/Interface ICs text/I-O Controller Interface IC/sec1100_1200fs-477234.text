SEC1100/1200
Smart Card Controllers with USB, SPI and UART Interfaces
SMSC’s SEC1100/1200 are low-cost, low-power, single-chip Smart Card controllers with USB, SPI or UART interfaces. Using
a combination of hardware and software, these devices deliver high-performance and flexible design customization options.
Both devices utilize SMSC’s TrustSpanTM technology which enables digital systems to securely communicate, process, move and
store information on system boards, across networks and through the cloud. Up-to-date EMV and USB certifications enhance
interoperability with all of the latest and legacy Smart Cards and host operating systems. Ready-to-use USB Chip Card
Interface Device (CCID) firmware provides a fast and easy platform to develop custom applications and one-time programmable
(OTP) memory offers the flexibility of custom firmware or vendor-specific device data. The OTP memory can be fully or partially
programmed by SMSC during chip manufacturing and by the customer during final product assembly. Package options range from a
small-footprint 16-pin QFN to our SEC1202 which offers a 48-pin QFN with dual Smart Card interfaces, dual SPI, UART, dual LED
and general purpose IOs for high-value designs. Additionally, SMSC’s complimentary and confidential USBCheck™ online design
review service is available for customers who select the SEC1100/120x family for their application design-in.*
