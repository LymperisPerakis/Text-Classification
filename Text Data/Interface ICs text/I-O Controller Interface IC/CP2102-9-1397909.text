CP2102/9
1. System Overview
The CP2102/9 is a highly-integrated USB-to-UART Bridge Controller providing a simple solution for updating RS-
232 designs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB space. The CP2102/9 includes a USB 2.0 full-
speed function controller, USB transceiver, oscillator, EEPROM or EPROM, and asynchronous serial data bus
(UART) with full modem control signals in a compact 5 x 5 mm QFN-28 package. No other external USB
components are required.
The on-chip programmable ROM may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID, Product ID, Product Description
String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, and Device Serial Number as desired for OEM applications.
The programmable ROM is programmed on-board via the USB, allowing the programming step to be easily
integrated into the product manufacturing and testing process.
Royalty-free Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers provided by Silicon Laboratories allow a CP2102/9-based
product to appear as a COM port to PC applications. The CP2102/9 UART interface implements all RS-232
signals, including control and handshaking signals, so existing system firmware does not need to be modified. In
many existing RS-232 designs, all that is required to update the design from RS-232 to USB is to replace the RS-
232 level-translator with the CP2102/9. Direct access driver support is available through the Silicon Laboratories
USBXpress driver set.

Notes:
   1. The USB Pull-up supply current values are calculated values based on USB specifications. USB Pull-up supply current
       is current flowing from VDD to GND through USB pull-down/pull-up resistors on D+ and D-.
   2. Thermal resistance assumes a multi-layer PCB with any exposed pad soldered to a PCB pad.
   3. USB Pull-up current should be added for total supply current. Normal and suspended supply current is current flowing
       into VREGIN. Normal and suspended supply current is guaranteed by characterization.

    Notes:
    General
       1. All dimensions shown are in millimeters (mm) unless otherwise noted.
       2. Dimensioning and Tolerancing is per the ANSI Y14.5M-1994 specification.
       3. This Land Pattern Design is based on the IPC-7351 guidelines.
    Solder Mask Design
       4. All metal pads are to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Clearance between the solder
           mask and the metal pad is to be 60 µm minimum, all the way around the pad.
    Stencil Design
       5. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be used
           to assure good solder paste release.
       6. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
       7. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for all perimeter pins.
       8. A 3x3 array of 0.90 mm openings on a 1.1 mm pitch should be used for the center pad to
           assure the proper paste volume (67% Paste Coverage).
    Card Assembly
       9. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
       10. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020 specification for Small
           Body Components.

6. USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The Universal Serial Bus function controller in the CP2102/9 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with
integrated transceiver and on-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages all data
transfers between the USB and the UART as well as command requests generated by the USB host controller and
commands for controlling the function of the UART.
The USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both the CP2102/9 device as well
as external circuitry. The CP2102/9 will enter Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. On
entering Suspend mode, the CP2102/9 asserts the SUSPEND and SUSPEND signals. SUSPEND and SUSPEND
are also asserted after a CP2102/9 reset until device configuration during USB Enumeration is complete.
The CP2102/9 exits Suspend mode when any of the following occur: (1) Resume signaling is detected or
generated, (2) a USB Reset signal is detected, or (3) a device reset occurs. On exit of Suspend mode, the
SUSPEND and SUSPEND signals are de-asserted.
Both SUSPEND and SUSPEND temporarily float high during a CP2102/9 reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a
strong pulldown (10 k) can be used to ensure SUSPEND remains low during reset. See Figure 5 for other
recommended options.

CP2102/9
7. Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interface
The CP2102/9 UART interface consists of the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data signals as well as the RTS,
CTS, DSR, DTR, DCD, and RI control signals. The UART supports RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR, and X-On/X-Off
handshaking.
The UART is programmable to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. If the Virtual COM Port drivers are
used, the data format and baud rate are set during COM port configuration on the PC. If the USBXpress drivers are
used, the CP2102/9 is configured through the USBXpress API. The data formats and baud rates available are
listed in Table 12.

8. Internal Programmable ROM
The CP2102 includes an internal electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and the
CP2109 includes an internal one-time programmable (OTP) erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM).
Either may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), Product Description String, Power
Descriptor, Device Release Number and Device Serial Number as desired for OEM applications. If the EEPROM/
EPROM is not programmed with OEM data, the default configuration data shown in Table 13 is used. The
EEPROM has a typical endurance of 100,000 write cycles with a data retention of 100 years. The EPROM can only
be written one time and cannot be erased.
While customization of the USB configuration data is optional, it is recommended to customize the VID/PID
combination. A unique VID/PID combination will prevent the driver from conflicting with any other USB driver. A
vendor ID can be obtained from http://www.usb.org/ or Silicon Laboratories can provide a free PID for the OEM
product that can be used with the Silicon Laboratories VID. It is also recommended to customize the serial number
if the OEM application is one in which it is possible for multiple CP2102/9-based devices to be connected to the
same PC.
The internal programmable ROM is programmed via the USB. This allows the OEM's USB configuration data and
serial number to be written to the CP2102/9 on-board ROM during the manufacturing and testing process. A stand-
alone utility for programming the internal programmable ROM is available from Silicon Laboratories. A library of
routines provided in the form of a Windows® DLL is also available. This library can be used to integrate the
programmable ROM programming step into custom software used by the OEM to streamline testing and serial
number management during manufacturing.
USB descriptors can be locked to prevent future modification on the CP2102. The CP2109 can be programmed in-
system over the USB interface by adding a capacitor to the PCB. If configuration ROM is to be programmed in-
system, a 4.7 μF capacitor must be added between the VPP pin and ground. No other circuitry should be
connected to VPP during a programming operation, and VDD must remain at 3.3 V or higher to successfully
write to the configuration ROM.

CP2102/9
9. CP2102/9 Device Drivers
There are two sets of device drivers available for the CP2102/9 devices: the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers and
the USBXpress Direct Access drivers. Only one set of drivers is necessary to interface with the device.
The latest drivers are available at http://www.silabs.com/support/Pages/software-downloads.aspx.
9.1. Virtual COM Port Drivers
The CP2102/9 Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2102/9-based device to appear to the PC's
application software as a COM port. Application software running on the PC accesses the CP2102/9-based device
as it would access a standard hardware COM port. However, actual data transfer between the PC and the CP2102/
9 device is performed over the USB interface. Therefore, existing COM port applications may be used to transfer
data via the USB to the CP2102/9-based device without modifying the application. See “AN197: Serial
Communications Guide for the CP210x” for Example Code for Interfacing to a CP2102/9 using the Virtual COM
drivers.
9.2. USBXpress Drivers
The Silicon Laboratories USBXpress drivers provide an alternate solution for interfacing with CP2102/9 devices.
No Serial Port protocol expertise is required. Instead, a simple, high-level application program interface (API) is
used to provide simpler CP210x connectivity and functionality. The USBXpress for CP210x Development Kit
includes Windows device drivers, Windows device driver installer and uninstallers, and a host interface function
library (host API) provided in the form of a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The USBXpress driver set is
recommended for new products that also include new PC software. The USBXpress interface is described in
“AN169: USBXpress® Programmer's Guide.”
9.3. Driver Customization
In addition to customizing the device as described in "8. Internal Programmable ROM" on page 17, the drivers and
the drivers installation package can be also be customized. See “AN220: USB Driver Customization” for more
information on generating customized VCP and USBXpress drivers.
9.4. Driver Certification
The default drivers that are shipped with the CP2102/9 are Microsoft WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs)
certified. The certification means that the drivers have been tested by Microsoft and their latest operating systems
(2000, Server 2003, XP, Vista, 7, and 8) will allow the drivers to be installed without any warnings or errors. Some
installations of Windows will prevent unsigned drivers from being installed at all.
The customized drivers that are generated using the AN220 software are not automatically certified. They must
first go through the Microsoft Driver Reseller Submission process. Contact Silicon Laboratories support for
assistance with this process.

10. Voltage Regulator
The CP2102/9 includes an on-chip 5 to 3 V voltage regulator. This allows the CP2102/9 to be configured as either
a USB bus-powered device or a USB self-powered device. These configurations are shown in Figure 6, Figure 7,
Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10. When enabled, the 3 V voltage regulator output appears on the VDD pin and can
be used to power external 3 V devices. See Table 6 for the voltage regulator electrical characteristics.
Alternatively, if 3 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2102/9 can function as a USB self-powered device with
the voltage regulator disabled. For this configuration, it is recommended that the REGIN input be tied to the 3 V net
to disable the voltage regulator. In addition, if VDD or REGIN may be unpowered while VBUS is 5 V, a resistor
divider (or functionally-equivalent circuit) shown in Note 1 of Figure 8 and Figure 10 is required to meet the
absolute maximum voltage on VBUS specification in Table 2.
The USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match the device power usage and configuration. See
“AN721: CP210x/CP211x Device Customization Guide” for information on how to customize USB descriptors for
the CP2102/9.
Note: It is recommended to connect additional decoupling capacitance (e.g., 0.1 µF in parallel with 1.0 µF) to the REGIN input.

11. Porting Considerations from CP2102 to CP2109
This section highlights the differences between the CP2102 and CP2109. These devices are designed to be pin-
compatible, and thus require very minor changes when porting hardware between devices. The CP2109 is an
updated, cost-reduced version of the CP2102 with a one-time programmable ROM.
11.1. Pin-Compatibility
The CP2109 is pin-compatible with the CP2102 with a single exception; the CP2109 requires an additional
capacitor between VPP and GND for in-application programming. This capacitor is not required after the CP2109
EPROM has been successfully programmed or if the CP2109 does not need to be customized in system.
11.2. Distinguishing Factors
The CP2102 has 1024 bytes of EEPROM for vendor ID (VID), product ID (PID), serial number, power descriptor,
release number, and product description strings. This configuration EEPROM can be written and re-written multiple
times. The CP2109 has 1024 bytes of one-time programmable EPROM for configuration. This configuration
EPROM can only be written one time.
The CP2109 may require an additional capacitor on VPP if in-application programming is desired.
The CP2102 default serial number is always “0001”. Every CP2109 is programmed from the factory with a unique
serial number.
11.3. Differences in Electrical Specifications
Table 14 and Table 15 list differences in absolute maximum and electrical specifications between the CP2102 and
CP2109. Refer to "3. Electrical Specifications" on page 6 for the comprehensive electrical specifications.
