Controller Architecture
A Thunderbolt controller is the building block used to create
Thunderbolt products. A Thunderbolt controller contains:
• A high-performance, cross-bar Thunderbolt protocol switch
• One or more Thunderbolt ports
• One or more DisplayPort protocol adapter ports
• One or more Thunderbolt ports
• A PCI Express switch with one or more PCI Express protocol

The external interfaces of a Thunderbolt controller that are
connected in a system depend on the application for which
the system is designed. An example implementation of a
host-side Thunderbolt controller is shown in Figure 4. Host
side Thunderbolt controllers have one or more DisplayPort
input interfaces, a PCI Express interface along with one or
more Thunderbolt technology interface. By integrating all the
