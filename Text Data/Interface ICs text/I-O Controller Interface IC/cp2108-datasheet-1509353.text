2. System Overview
The CP2108 is a highly integrated USB-to-Quad-UART Bridge Controller providing a simple solution for updating RS-232/RS-485 de-
signs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB space. The CP2108 includes a USB 2.0 full-speed function controller, USB
transceiver, oscillator, EEPROM, and four asynchronous serial data buses (UART) with full modem control signals in a compact 9 x 9
mm QFN-64 package (sometimes called “MLF” or “MLP”).
The on-chip EEPROM may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), Product Description String, Power De-
scriptor, Device Release Number, Interface Strings, Device Serial Number, Modem, and GPIO configuration as desired for OEM appli-
cations. The EEPROM is programmed on-board via the USB, allowing the programming step to be easily integrated into the product
manufacturing and testing process.
Royalty-free Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers provided by Silicon Labs allow a CP2108-based product to appear as four COM
ports in PC applications. The CP2108 UART interfaces implement all RS-232/RS-485 signals including control and handshaking, so
existing system firmware does not need to be modified. The device also features a total of sixteen GPIO signals that can be user-de-
fined for status and control information. See www.silabs.com/appnotes for the latest application notes and product support information
for the CP2108.
An evaluation kit for the CP2108 is available. It includes a CP2108-based USB-to-UART/RS-232 evaluation board, a complete set of
VCP device drivers, USB and RS-232 cables, and full documentation. Contact a Silicon Labs sales representative or go to www.si-
labs.com/products/interface/Pages/CP2108EK.aspx to order the CP2108 Evaluation Kit.

 Note:
    1. All voltages are with respect to VSS.
    2. This applies only when using the regulator. When not using the regulator, VREGIN and VDD are tied together externally and it is
       allowable for VREGIN to be equal to VDD.
    3. If the device is connected to the USB bus, the USB pull-up current should be added to the supply current to calculate total re-
       quired current.
    4. The USB pull-up supply current values are calculated values based on USB specifications.

3.4 Throughput and Flow Control
The throughput values in the following table are typical values based on bench testing and can serve as a guideline for expected per-
formance. Other factors such as PC system performance and USB bus loading will have an effect on throughput. Each column in the
table shows the typical throughput using 1, 2, 3 or all 4 UART interfaces for the set baud rate.
   1. It is not necessary to use hardware flow control if all CP2108 interfaces are configured for 230,400 bps or lower.
   2. For baud rates above 230,400 bps, hardware flow control should be used to guarantee reception of all bytes across the UART.
      Also, sending data across multiple interfaces simultaneously will cause a reduction in the effective throughput for each interface.
   3. UART 3 has lower throughput rates than UARTS 0-2. If the application is configured such that different interfaces will operate at
      different baud rates, the interface at the lowest baud rate should be put on UART 3. UART 3 throughput is 5% to 20% slower than
      the other interfaces.
   4. The performance of UART 3 starts to become significantly slower than the other UART interfaces at baud rates greater than
      230,400 bps.

       minimum, all the way around the pad.
 Stencil Design
    1. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be used to assure good solder paste release.
    2. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
    3. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for all pads.
    4. A 3x3 array of 1.0 mm square openings on a 1.5 mm pitch should be used for the center ground pad.
 Card Assembly
    1. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
    2. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020 specification for Small Body Components.

There are two configurations for self-powered applications: regulator used and regulator bypassed. To provide VDD in a self-powered
application using the regulator, use the same connections from the previous figure, but connect VREGIN to an on-board 5 V supply and
disconnect it from the VBUS pin. The typical self-powered connections with the regulator used is shown in the following figure.

Alternatively, if 3.0 to 3.6 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2108 can function as a USB self-powered device with the voltage
regulator bypassed. For this configuration, the VREGIN input should be tied to VDD to bypass the voltage regulator. The following fig-
ure shows a typical connection diagram showing the device in a self-powered application with the regulator bypassed.

                  connector for ESD protection. Use Littelfuse p/n SP0503BAHT or equivalent.
      Note 2 : An external pull-up is not required, but can be added for noise immunity.
      Note 3 : VIO can be connected directly to VDD or to a supply as low as 1.8 V to set the I/O interface voltage.
      Note 4: There are 2 VIO pins. All should be connected together. Each require a separate 1 µF and a 0.1 µF
                  capacitor.

                                                                                           USB Function Controller and Transceiver
7. USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) function controller in the CP2108 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with integrated transceiver
and on-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages all data transfers between the USB and the UARTs
as well as command requests generated by the USB host controller and commands for controlling the function of the UARTs and GPIO
pins.
Device pins for UART 0-2 are powered by VIO, while UART 3 pins 1-6 are powered through VIOHD and are high drive pins. These high
drive pins have higher input voltage requirements than other pins which are noted in all the electrical tables.
The USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both the CP2108 device as well as external circuitry.
The CP2108 will enter Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. Upon entering Suspend mode, the CP2108
asserts the SUSPEND and /SUSPEND signals. SUSPEND and /SUSPEND signals are also asserted after a CP2108 reset until device
configuration during USB enumeration is complete.
The CP2108 exits the Suspend mode when any of the following occur: resume signaling is detected or generated, a USB Reset signal
is detected, or a device reset occurs. On exit of Suspend mode, the SUSPEND and /SUSPEND signals are de-asserted. SUSPEND
and /SUSPEND are weakly pulled to VIO in a high impedance state during a CP2108 reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong
pulldown (10 kΩ) can be used to ensure /SUSPEND remains low during reset.
The logic level and output mode (push-pull or open-drain) of various pins during USB Suspend is configurable in the EEPROM. See
TODO for more information.
The USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match the device power usage and configuration. See application note

tors for the CP2108.

8. Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interfaces
The CP2108 contains four UART interfaces, each consisting of the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data signals and RTS and CTS flow
control signals. The UARTs also support modem flow control (DSR, DTR, DCD, RI).
The UARTs are programmable to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. The Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers are used to set
the data format and baud rate during COM port configuration on the PC. The data formats and baud rates available to each UART
interface are listed in the following table.

 Note:

8.1 Baud Rate Generation
The baud rate generator for the interface is very flexible, allowing any baud rate in the range from 300 bps to 2.0 Mbps. If the baud rate
cannot be directly generated from the 80 MHz oscillator, the device will choose the closest possible option. The actual baud rate is
dictated by the following equations.
                            80 MHz
Clock Divider =                                –1
                  2 × Requested Baud Rate
                            80 MHz
Actual Baud Rate =
                       2 × Clock Divider
Most baud rates can be generated with an error of less than 1.0%. A general rule of thumb for the majority of UART applications is to
limit the baud rate error on both the transmitter and the receiver to no more than ±2%. The clock divider value obtained in Equation 1 is
rounded to the nearest integer, which may produce an error source. Another error source will be the 80 MHz oscillator, which is accu-
rate to ±0.25%. Knowing the actual and requested baud rates, the total baud rate error can be found using the following equation.
Baud Rate Error (%) = 100 × 1 –  (      Actual Baud Rate
                                     Requested Baud Rate   ) ± 0.25%
The UART interfaces support the transmission and reception of a line break. The CP2108 detects a line break when the RX line is held
low for longer than one byte time at the configured baud rate. The length of a transmitted line break is application-specific: the applica-
tion sends a SET_BREAK command to set the TX line low, and the line stays low until the application sends a CLEAR_BREAK com-
mand.

9. GPIO and UART Pins
The CP2108 supports sixteen user-configurable GPIO pins for status and control information. Each of these GPIO pins are usable as
inputs, open-drain outputs, or push-pull outputs. By default, all of the GPIO pins are configured as a GPIO input. A logic high, open-
drain output pulls the pin to the VIO rail through an internal, pull-up resistor. A logic high, push-pull output directly connects the pin to
the VIO voltage. Open-drain outputs and push-pull outputs are identical when driving a logic low.
The speed to read and write the GPIO pins from an application is subject to the timing of the USB bus. GPIO pins configured as inputs
or outputs are not recommended for real-time signaling.
In addition to the primary GPIO function, each GPIO pin has an alternate function listed in the following table.
More information regarding the configuration and usage of the GPIO pins can be found in application note AN721: CP210x/CP211x

9.1 GPIO — Alternate Clock Outputs
There are four alternate clock outputs. The clock output frequency is shown in the following equation. Each clock has a 1-byte divider
value. GPIO pins 3,7,11, and 15 can output a configurable CMOS clock output. The clock output appears at the pin at the same time
the device completes enumeration and exits USB Suspend mode. The clock output is removed from the pin when the device enters
USB Suspend mode.
The clocks are derived by dividing the CP2108 core clock, allowing external components to be clocked synchronously with the CP2108.
                                 40 MHz
Clock Output Frequency =
                              Clock Divider
Note: A clock divider value of 1 is invalid, and a clock divider of 0 results in a frequency of 156 kHz.

9.2 GPIO — Transmit and Receive Toggle
GPIO.0, GPIO.1, GPIO.4, GPIO.5, GPIO.8, GPIO.9, GPIO.12, and GPIO.13 pins are configurable as Transmit Toggle and Receive
Toggle pins for the four UART interfaces. These pins are logic high when a device is not transmitting or receiving data, and they toggle
at a fixed rate as specified in 3.1.3 GPIO when data transfer is in progress. Typically, these pins are connected to two LEDs to indicate
data transfer.

                                                                                                                   GPIO and UART Pins
9.4 Hardware Flow Control (RTS and CTS)
To utilize the functionality of the RTS and CTS pins of the CP2108, each interface must be configured to use hardware flow control.
RTS, or Ready To Send, is an active-low output from the CP2108 and indicates to the external UART device that the CP2108’s UART
RX FIFO has not reached the watermark level of 1536 bytes and is ready to accept more data. When the amount of data in the RX
FIFO reaches the watermark, the CP2108 pulls RTS high to indicate to the external UART device to stop sending data.
CTS, or Clear To Send, is an active-low input to the CP2108 and is used by the external UART device to indicate to the CP2108 when
the external UART device’s RX FIFO is getting full. The CP2108 will not send more than two bytes of data once CTS is pulled high.
The CP2108 stores the received data in internal buffers. It is possible for the CP2108 to receive data on the RX line before a handle to
it is opened. In this case the user may wish to send the data to the USB pipe or may wish to flush it. Similarly, the user may close the
handle while data is still in the internal transmit buffer. It may be desirable to continue sending all of the data out the TX pin after the
handle has been closed. The flush buffer configuration options allow the user to define whether each buffer is flushed when a handle to
the device is opened or closed. By default all the buffers will be flushed when a handle is opened and will not be flushed when a handle
is closed. These options are configurable using Xpress Configurator in Simplicity Studio (www.silabs.com/simplicity) as shown in the
following figure.

9.5 High Drive Pins UART 3 Pins 1–6
The UART 3 pins 1–6 are high drive pins that have different input voltage conditions than the other UART and GPIO pins. If an input
voltage for VDD, VIO, and VIOHD is used that is overlapping for the three ranges, then these pins can all be tied together. One of the
benefits of this variation is that UART 3 can accept an input of up to 6 V and therefore can be connected directly to a 5 V device without
additional circuitry.

10. Internal EEPROM
The CP2108 includes an internal EEPROM that may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), Product De-
scription String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, Interface Strings, and Device Serial Number as desired for OEM applica-
tions. If the EEPROM has not been programmed with OEM data, the default configuration data shown in the following tables are used.
While customization of the USB configuration data is optional, customizing the VID/PID combination is strongly recommended. A
unique VID/PID combination will prevent the driver from conflicting with any other USB driver from a different manufacturer’s product. A
vendor ID can be obtained from www.usb.org, or Silicon Labs can provide a free PID for the OEM product that can be used with the
Silicon Labs VID. Customizing the serial string for each individual device is also recommended if the OEM application is one in which it
is possible for multiple CP210x-based devices to be connected to the same PC. Refer to application note AN721: CP210x/CP211x
Customization Guide for more information about device customization.

The internal EEPROM is programmed using the USB interface. This allows the OEM's USB configuration data and serial number to be
written to the CP2108 on-board during the manufacturing and testing process. A stand-alone utility for programming the internal EE-
PROM is available from Silicon Labs. A library of routines provided in the form of a Windows® DLL is also available. This library can be
used to integrate the EEPROM programming step into custom software used by the OEM to streamline testing and serial number man-
agement during manufacturing. USB descriptors can be locked to prevent future modification.

11. CP2108 Device Drivers
The device driver available for CP2108 is the Virtual COM Port (VCP) driver. The latest drivers are available at www.silabs.com/
vcpdrivers.
11.1 Virtual COM Port (VCP) Drivers
The CP2108 Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2108-based device to appear to the PC's application software as four
COM ports. Application software running on the PC accesses the CP2108-based device as it would access four standard hardware
COM ports. However, actual data transfer between the PC and the CP2108 device is performed over the USB interface. Therefore,
existing COM port applications may be used to transfer data via the USB to the CP2108-based device without modifying the applica-
tion. See application note AN197: Serial Communications Guide for the CP210x for example code for interfacing to a CP2108 using the
VCP drivers.
Note: Because the CP2108 uses a USB-based communication interface, timing will not be controllable or guaranteed as it is with a
standard COM port. Full-speed USB operates on 1 ms frames, and the host schedules packets for each USB device where it can in the
1 ms frame. It is recommended to use large data transfers when reading and writing from the host to send data as quickly as possible.
11.2 Driver Customization
In addition to customizing the device as described in 8. Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interfaces, the drivers and the drivers
installation package can be also be customized. See application note AN220: USB Driver Customization for more information on gener-
ating customized VCP drivers.
Note: The VID/PID in the drivers must match the VID/PID in the device for the drivers to load properly when the device is connected to
the PC.
11.3 Driver Certification
The default drivers for the CP2108 are Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) certified. The certification means that the
drivers have been tested by Microsoft and their latest operating systems will allow the drivers to be installed without any warnings or
errors.
The customized drivers that are generated using the AN220 software are not automatically certified. To become certified, they must go
first through the Microsoft Driver Reseller submission process. Refer to AN807: Recertifying a Customized Windows HCK Driver Pack-
age for assistance with this process.
