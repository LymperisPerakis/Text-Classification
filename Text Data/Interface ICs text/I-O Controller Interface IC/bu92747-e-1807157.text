●Reset
    Reset of IrDA controller and Ir remote control is common. In the case of crystal CLK oscillation, CLK isn't stable both just
    after the power supply is turned on and after the power down is reset. Therefore, RESET should be set to keep L
    for 2 or 3 msec until CLK becomes stable, and then RESET should be set to H after CLK stabilize.
    (Make sure that the unstable period of CLK depends on Crystal and circuit constants etc.)
●Input clock
    Input clock frequency is 48MHz.The tolerance is within ±100ppm.
    The basis of the Duty ratio is 50% , and make it within ±30%.
●About the IrSimple reception
    Data is transmitted more one-sidedly than the sending side at the IrSimple-Uni-mode. The error interrupt such as OE_EI
    and DEX_EI is generated when processing and the received data reading speed to interrupt request (INTR:L) are slow etc.
    and it is not likely to be able to receive it normally. It is necessary to set the interrupt processing and the reading speed, etc.
    at which the entire system is considered on the HOST side.
●Example of crystal-oscillator circuit configuration
    Please decide final circuitry and the constant after consulting the crystal-oscillator manufacturer.

     Caution: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
     between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is
     operated over the absolute maximum ratings.

●Time-out
    Interrupt requests are issued when a time-out occurs in the FIFO buffer under the following conditions:
       1 Condition causing an MIR and FIR receive time-out
            When one or more bytes of data is present in the FIFO buffer, the CPU does not read the FIFO buffer data
            even though 64s has elapsed after the last writing of data into the FIFO buffer from the receive shift register.
       2 Condition causing an SIR receives time-out
            When one or more bytes of data is present in the receive FIFO buffer, the CPU does not read the FIFO buffer data
            even though the Tout time has elapsed after the last writing of data into the FIFO buffer from
            the receive shift register.
            Tout = 4  (1 / Baud rate)  10
       3 Condition causing an MIR and FIR transmission time-out
            The CPU does not access the FIFO buffer for 1ms or more in the transmission mode.
            (Except for the condition of FTLV≦FLV)
       4 Condition causing a many windows transmission mode time-out
            The CPU does not write data for 1ms in many windows transmit mode, after setting FTLV or writing a former DATA.
            (Except for the condition of FTLV≦(FLV - FLVⅡ))

●TXD / RXD: Transmit/Receive Data Register
    TXD/RXD shares the same address.
    TXD is accessed when transmission data is written and is used as a transmission data hold register.
    When the FIFO buffer is effective, it works as the first storage register of TX_FIFO.
    RXD is accessed when received data is read out and is used as a receive data storage register.
    When the FIFO buffer is effective, it also works as the last storage register of RX_FIFO. Neither reading from TXD nor
    writing to RXD can be performed.
●IER: Interrupt Enable Register
    IER is used to control (enable) various kinds of interrupts.
    All 13 bits correspond to interrupts so that they can be controlled independently.
    Once system reset takes place, all the bits are set to "0". Each interrupt can be enabled by writing “1” to the corresponding
    bit.
IER0: DRX_IE (Data Receiver Interrupt Enable)
    When one-byte received data has been transmitted in SIR mode from the receive shift register to the FIFO buffer,
    this bit sets an interrupt as a data read request.
IER1:
    This bit works as EOFRX_IE in SIR mode or as STFRX_IE in MIR, FIR mode.
         EOFRX_IE: (End of Frame Receiver Interrupt Enable)
                         Sets an interrupt as a data read request when EOF (C1) data has been written to FIFO.
         STFRX_IE: (Stop Flag Receiver Interrupt Enable)
                         Sets a data read request when a Stop Flag has been detected during data reception.
IER2: TO_IE (Timeout Interrupt Enable)
    This bit sets an interrupt for time-out.
IER3: TXE_IE (Transmitter Empty Interrupt Enable)

●EIR: Event Identification Register
    EIR indicates an interrupt source at interrupt occurrence. All 13 bits corresponds to interrupts (interrupt array) set in IER.
    When an interrupt is invalid, the corresponding bits of EIR (status register) are set to “1” at event occurrence.
    At system reset, all bits are reset to “0". In addition, this register is cleared to“0” when the CPU reads data in the register.
EIR0: DRX_EI (Data Receiver Event Identification)
    This bit is set to “1” when one-byte received data is transmitted from the receive shift register to the FIFO buffer
    in SIR mode.
EIR1:
    This bit works as EOFRX_EI in SIR mode and STFRX_EI in MIR and FIR mode.
          EOFRX_EI: (End of Frame Receiver Event Identification)
                         Sets an interrupt as a data read request when EOF (C1) data has been written to FIFO.
          STFRX_EI: (Stop Flag Receiver Event Identification)
                       Sets an interrupt as a data read request when a Stop Flag has been detected during reception.
EIR2: TO_EI (Timeout Event Identification)
    This bit is set to“1” for time-out.
EIR3: TXE_EI (Transmitter Empty Event Identification)
    This bit is set to “1” when both transmissions FIFO buffer and transmission shift register are emptied and frame
    transmission is completed during data transmission. （This bit is set to “1” only when FIFO buffer becomes empty by
    transmitting data.
    If this bit is cleared by FCLR, it remains “0”.）

    when read the FIFO data.
    In the case, all data in FIFO is automatically reset by BU92747XXX, and it becomes FLV=FLVⅡ=0.
EIR9: DEX_EI (Data Exist Event Identification)
    This bit is effective in many windows receive mode (MIR and FIR) and AUTO_FLV_CP mode.
    When the setting is not done to FLV_CP=1 until the data of the next frame is received after Stop Flag of a front frame is
    received, interrupt is set. In that case, all data that exists in FIFO in the hard independence is reset, and it becomes
    FLV=FLVⅡ= FLVⅢ=FLVⅣ =0.
    This bit is set to "1" as a frame error when the Start Flag reception of the frame will start one after another by the time
    CPU finishes reading receive data after generating the RDE_EI interruption at the AUTO_ FLV_CP mode
EIR10: RDUE_EI (Read Underrun Error Event Identification)
    This bit is effective in many windows receive mode (MIR and FIR).
    This bit is set to "1" as a register that notifies the reading leaving of the front frame data FLVⅡ ≠ 0 to be
    when the value of FLV is copied to FLVⅡ with FLV_CP=1 (TRCR13).
EIR11: WRE_EI (Write Enable Event Identification)
    This bit is effective in many windows transmit mode.
    This bit is set to "1" as a register which tells the CPU to be able to write next frame data in many windows transmit mode.

●TRCR: Transmit / Receive Control Register
    The TRCR register sets various environments for transmission and reception.
TRCR0: TX_EN (Transmit Enable)
    When this bit is set to “1”, the transmission mode is set.
    When this bit is set to “0”, all data within the FIFO buffer is transmitted, and then transmission is terminated.
    When the relation between the number of registers set in the FTLV register and the FLV register (register indicating the
    amount of data within the buffer) is FLV  FTLV, then TX_EN=0 is automatically set and data transmission is terminated
    after all data within the FIFO buffer is transmitted.
    (Do not set TX_EN and RX_EN to 1 even though this setting causes data reception to take precedence over data
    transmission.)
TRCR1: RX_EN (Receive Enable)
    When this bit is set to “1”, the receive mode is set.
    When this bit is set to “0”, data reception is terminated. When the last data is odd byte at SIR reception,
    it must be “C1” (EOF).
    (When "C1" data of EOF is written on the LSB side of FIFO at the SIR mode, "00" is inserted in the MSB side by
    independence and the increment does the FIFO pointer.)
    In addition, when the receive mode is terminated once and set again after received data has been read at FIR reception,
    the next reception is started.
    (RX_CON=1and RX_EN=1, or AUTO_FLV_CP=1 and RX_EN=1, this bit doesn't have to be set to the
    receiving mode again.)
TRCR2: S_EOT (Set End of Transmission)
    This bit is effective in MIR and FIR mode. When This bit is set to ”1”, the next data written to the FIFO buffer
      (2-byte data only) is recognized as the last data and CRC and STF are added just after that data to send a frame.
    After frame transmission this bit is automatically set to “0". This bit cannot be used in SIR mode.
TRCR3: IR_PLS (IrDA Pulse)
    This bit is effective in MIR mode, FIR mode and many windows transmit mode (MIR and FIR). When this bit is set to “1”,
    an interaction pulse is transmitted just after the frame being transmitted. After transmission, IR_PLS is automatically set to
    “0". This bit cannot be used in SIR mode.
                                                8.7us

TRCR4: FCLR (FIFO clear)
    When this bit is set to “1”, WP (Write Point) and RP (Read Point) within the FIFO buffer are initialized.
    After completion of initialization, this bit is automatically set to “0".
TRCR5: MS_EN (Mode Select Enable)
    This bit is used to switch the communication mode of the Rohm IrDA module RPM971/972.
    When this bit is set to “1”, the operation mode of the IrDA module is changed according to the current operation mode of
    BU92747XXX. Upon completion of operation, MS_EN is automatically set to “0".
    When BU92747XXX has been set in the FIR mode, IrDA Module is changed to the FIR mode:
       1. The IrDA PWDOWN and IrTX pins are set to “High (H)".
       2. After about 200ns have elapsed, the IrDA PWDOWN pin is set to “Low (L)".
       3. After about 200ns have elapsed, the IrTX pin is set to “Low (L)” for 200µs.
    When BU92747XXX has been set in the SIR/MIR mode, IrDA Module is changed to the SIR mode:
       1. The IrDA PWDOWN pin is set to "High (H)” and the IrTX pin is set to “Low (L)".
       2. After about 200ns have elapsed, the IrDA PWDOWN pin is set to “Low (L)”.
       3. After about 200ns have elapsed, the IrTX pin is set to “Low (L)” for 200µs.
       (When TRCR3 and TRCR5 is set to “1” at the same time, TRCR5 takes precedence.)
TRCR6: IrPD (IrDA POWER DOWN)
    When this bit is set to “1”, the IrDA PWDOWN pin is set to “Hi”.
    When this bit is set to “0”, the IrDA PWDOWN pin is set to “Lo”.
    At system reset, this bit is set to "1". (When TRCR5 and TRCR6 is set to “1” at the same time, TRCR6 takes precedence.)

TRCR7: M_STA (MIR Start Flag times)
    This bit controls start flag times in MIR mode.
    When this bit is set to "0", start flag is 7E × 2 times (Default).
    When this bit is set to "1", start flag is 7E × 4times.
TRCR8: RXPWD (RXD Power down)
    When this bit is set to "1", the receive demodulation block is set to the power-down mode. Usually, RXPWD is set to “0".
TRCR9: TXPWD (TXD Power down)
    When this bit is set to "1", the transmission demodulation block is set to the power-down mode. Usually,
    TXPWD is set to “0”.
TRCR10: 1byteRead
    This bit is effective in SIR mode.
    When this bit is set to “1", 1-byte received data is written to the FIFO LSB and “00” is written to the FIFO MSB,
    resulting in 16-bit data h00xx. (Data is written to the only FIFO LSB 8bits)
    When this bit is set to “0”, 2-byte received data is written to the FIFO 16 bits.

TRCR11:AUTO_FLV_CP
    AUTO_FLV_CP (Automation many windows receive mode) change register. TRCR13 (FLV_CP) is processed by the
    automatic operation. The register of IER/EIR8, 9, and 12 , FLVⅡ, FLVⅢ, and FLVⅣ becomes effective by setting "1" to
    this bit at the MIR, FIR mode.
TRCR12: RX_CON
    When this bit is set to "1", the mode becomes many windows receive mode.
    In the MIR, FIR mode IER/EIR8.9.10 and FLVⅡ register are available.
    In the SIR mode, FIFO pointer is increased by itself after EOF"C1" data is written FIFO LSB.
    At the same moment, "00" is written to FIFO MSB.
TRCR13: FLV_CP
    This bit is effective in many windows receive mode (MIR and FIR).
    When this bit is set to "1", the data is copied from FLV to FLVⅡ. After the action, this bit is set to “0” automatically.
TRCR14：TX_CON
    When this bit is set to "1", the mode becomes many windows transmit mode. Data frame begins to be transmitted in the
    condition of FLV≧FTLV. FLV is data number written in FIFO, FTLV is data number transmitted.
    At the same moment, WRE_EI that means the CPU is able to write next frame data is set to "1".
    The rotation of these actions enables to transmit many windows.
TRCR15：TX_NUM
    This bit is effective in the many windows transmit mode (TX_CON=1).
    When the frame begins to be transmitted in the many windows transmit mode, this bit is set to "1" at the same time
    automatically. This bit is reset when TX_CON is set to "0".

 TRANSFER
    During “H” period of SCL, one data bit is transferred. The data on the SDA line must be stable during the HIGH period
    of the clock, as changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as a control signal.

  START AND STOP CONDITIONS
    Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH to LOW transition of the data line, while the
    clock is HIGH is defined as the START (S) condition. A LOW to HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is
    HIGH is defined as the STOP (P) condition.

  ACKNOWLEDGE
    After the occurrence of START condition, each 8-bits has to be followed. A receiver must generate an
    acknowledgement by pulling down the SDA line after the reception of each byte. In this event the transmitter leaves
    the SDA line.

  REGISTER WRITING PROTOCOL
     The following sentence is about writing protocol. After transmitting the slave address and WRITE command (first
     byte), the register address of BU92747XXX is transferred (second byte). The third byte is the register data of this
     register address (second byte). After the register data (third byte), it is possible to send the register data
     consecutively. The address is automatically increased. But the next register address becomes 00h when the
     register address becomes final address (3Fh). After finishing the transmission, the register address is increased.

         interrupt
    When transmission buffer is null, internal interrupt is generated.
    After the reset is canceled, transmission buffer becomes null.
    When Send bit is set to “1”, the setting data is forwarded to the transmission buffer, and starts the transmission in
    IrRC (or IrTX) pin.
    When the data is forward to the transmission buffer, the interrupt is cleared.
    Also, when Irqc bit is set “1”, the interrupt is cleared.
    When Irqe bit is set “1”, NIRQ pin outputs the interrupt condition because the internal interrupt is permitted.
    When Irqe bit is set “0”, NIRQ pin outputs “HIGH” because the internal interrupt is masked.

       ・Regs bit sets “0”: if Send bit sets “1”, the value of output data register is forwarded to the transmission buffer and
          internal interrupt is generated.
       ・Regs bit sets “1”: If Send bit sets “1”, the value of output data register is forwarded to the transmission buffer and
          internal interrupt factor is generated. Afterward, the value of output data register is forwarded to the transmission
          buffer when the last bit of transmission buffer is outputted. As often as this transmission is finished, internal
          interrupt is generated.
      Afterward, finished End part output, interrupt is generated (refer ○   c in the figure).
      When Irqc bit sets “1”, interrupt is cleared (refer ○  b and ○  d in the figure).
      When Irqe bit sets “1”, internal interrupt is permitted. Therefore with generating the internal interrupt, NIRQ pin
      outputs ”LOW” (refer ○    a and   ○c   in the figure).
      When Irqe bit sets “0”, NIRQ pin fixes “HIGH” (refer ○   e in the figure).

     This is an example that data length of one frame is 386 bits.
     a. Register setting is Irqe=1, i.e. it is permitted interrupt, Regs=1, i.e. it is repeated to forward output data register to
         transmission buffer, and Out0~15=Data_a, i.e. it is set output data register to Data_a as transmission data. Then
         to set Send=1, the transmission is started.
     b. After the transmission is started, Out0~15 is forwarded to transmission buffer. Then, interrupt is generated
         (NIRQ=”LOW”), and it is informed to update Out0~15.
     c. After Irqc=1, i.e. it is cleared internal interrupt, Out0~15 set to Data_b.
     d. After header part output is finished, Data_a in transmission buffer is outputted from IrRC(or IrTx) pin.
     e. When the last bit of Data_a is outputted, Data_b in Out0~15 is forwarded to transmission buffer. Then interrupt is
         generated, and it is informed to update Out0~15.
     f. After Data_a output is finished, Data_b in transmission buffer is outputted to IrRC (or IrTx) pin.
     g. After internal interrupt is cleared, Out0~15 set to Data_c.
     h. When the last bit of Data_b is outputted, Data_c in Out0~15 is forwarded to transmission buffer. Then interrupt is
         generated, and it is informed to update Out0~15.
     i. After Data_b output is finished, Data_c of transmission buffer is outputted to IrRC (or IrTx) pin.
     j. Internal interrupt is cleared. Then register setting is Regs=0, i.e. it is to forwarded output data register to
         transmission buffer once, and BitLen=02h, i.e. data bit length is 2bits.
     k. When the last bit of Data_c is outputted, Data_d in Out0~15 is forwarded to transmission buffer. Then interrupt is
         generated. For Regs=0 and BitLen=02h, finished Data_c output, next output is 2bits of Data_d.
     l. After Data_b output is finished, 2bits of Data_d in transmission buffer is outputted to IrRC (or ITtx) pin, then End
     m. A sequence of sending is finished, and then interrupt is generated.
         To repeat above e-g, it is enabled to send more than 128 bits data length.

    Note 1   When it is sent the data of more than 128 bits, if data output is sent several times in the way to set Rpt
                                                     nd                                     st
             register, the frame output after the 2 frame output is different from the 1 frame output. In the above
                                           nd                                                             st
             example, if Rpt=2, the 2 frame output is “Header + 2bits in Data_d + End part”. If 1 frame output is
                                   st
             repeated. After 1 frame output is finished, it needs to re-set Reg=1 and Out0-15.
    Note 2  When start of header is selected as base of frame interval (Frmb=0), It is the possibility that the time to send
            a series of data from header to End part is out of the FrmLen’s range. To avoid such a case, end of End part
            as base of frame interval is selected (Frmb=1).

●Operational Notes
1. Reverse Connection of Power Supply
    Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
    connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power supply pins.
2. Power Supply Lines
    Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all
    power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic
    capacitors.
3. Ground Voltage
    Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
4. Ground Wiring Pattern
    When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
    connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal ground
    caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations on the ground
    voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
5. Thermal Consideration
    Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
    deterioration of the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the board size and
    copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
6. Recommended Operating Conditions
    These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained. The
    electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
7. Inrush Current
    When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
    instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power supply.
    Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and routing of
    connections.
8. Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
    Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
9. Testing on Application Boards
    When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may subject the
    IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply should always be
    turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection process. To prevent damage
    from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during transport and storage.
10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
    Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
    damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin. Inter-pin
    shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and unintentional
    solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
11. Unused Input Pins
    Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
    extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small charge
    acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and cause unexpected
    operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the power supply or ground
    line.
12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
    In the construction of this IC, P-N junctions are inevitably formed creating parasitic diodes or transistors. The operation of
    these parasitic elements can result in mutual interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore,
    conditions which cause these parasitic elements to operate, such as applying a voltage to an input pin lower than the ground
    voltage should be avoided. Furthermore, do not apply a voltage to the input pins when no power supply voltage is applied to
    the IC. Even if the power supply voltage is applied, make sure that the input pins have voltages within the values specified in
    the electrical characteristics of this IC.

              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification
