 It is our intention to provide our valued customers with the best documentation possible to ensure successful use of your Microchip
 products. To this end, we will continue to improve our publications to better suit your needs. Our publications will be refined and
 enhanced as new volumes and updates are introduced.
 If you have any questions or comments regarding this publication, please contact the Marketing Communications Department via
 E-mail at docerrors@microchip.com. We welcome your feedback.
 Most Current Data Sheet
 To obtain the most up-to-date version of this data sheet, please register at our Worldwide Web site at:
        http://www.microchip.com
 You can determine the version of a data sheet by examining its literature number found on the bottom outside corner of any page.
 The last character of the literature number is the version number, (e.g., DS30000000A is version A of document DS30000000).
 Errata
 An errata sheet, describing minor operational differences from the data sheet and recommended workarounds, may exist for cur-
 rent devices. As device/documentation issues become known to us, we will publish an errata sheet. The errata will specify the
 revision of silicon and revision of document to which it applies.
 To determine if an errata sheet exists for a particular device, please check with one of the following:
 • Microchip’s Worldwide Web site; http://www.microchip.com
 • Your local Microchip sales office (see last page)
 When contacting a sales office, please specify which device, revision of silicon and data sheet (include -literature number) you are
 using.

1.0       INTRODUCTION
1.1       General Description
The SCH3223 is a 3.3V (Super I/O Block is 5V tolerant) PC99/PC2001 compliant Super I/O controller with an LPC inter-
face. The SCH3223 also includes Hardware Monitoring capabilities, enhanced Security features, Power Control logic
and Motherboard Glue logic.
The SCH3223 is ACPI 1.0/2.0 compatible and therefore supports multiple low power-down modes. It incorporates
sophisticated power control circuitry (PCC), which includes support for keyboard.
The SCH3223 supports the ISA Plug-and-Play Standard register set (Version 1.0a). The I/O Address and hardware IRQ
of each Logical Device may be reprogrammed through the internal configuration registers. There are up to 480 I/O
address location options, and a Serialized IRQ interface.
Super I/O functionality includes two serial ports. The serial ports are fully functional NS16550 compatible UARTs that
support data rates up to 1.5 Mbps. They both have the full 8 pin interface. The Serial Ports contain programmable direc-
tion control, which will automatically drive nRTS when the Output Buffer is loaded, then drive nRTS when the Output
Buffer is empty.
Hardware Monitoring (HWM) includes support for monitoring an external temperature via thermal diode inputs and an
internal sensor for measuring local ambient temperature.
Hardware Monitoring also includes programmable, automatic fan control, consisting of a fan tachometer input and a
pulse width modulator (PWM) fan control output, responding to temperature inputs and programmable via the LPC bus.
It has the ability to alert the system to out-of-limit conditions and automatically control the speed of a fan in response.
Hardware Monitoring capability also includes voltage monitoring, and it has the ability to alert the system to out-of-limit
conditions. There are four analog inputs for monitoring external voltages of +5V, +2.5V, +12V and Vccp (core processor
voltage), as well as internal monitoring of the device’s internal VCC, VTR, and VBAT power supplies. SMI and PME
Wake outputs are provided to indicate out-of-limit temperature, voltage, and fan speed conditions. Hardware Monitoring
features are accessible via the LPC bus.
The Motherboard Glue logic includes various power management and system logic including generation of nRSMRST,
and reset generation. The reset generation includes a watchdog timer which can be used to generate a reset pulse. The
width of this pulse is selectable via an external strapping option.
System related functionality, which offers flexibility to the system designer, includes General Purpose I/O control func-
tions, and control of two LED's.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
