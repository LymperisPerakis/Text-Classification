CP2103
1. System Overview
The CP2103 is a highly-integrated USB-to-UART Bridge Controller providing a simple solution for updating
RS-232/RS-485 designs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB space. The CP2103 includes a USB
2.0 full-speed function controller, USB transceiver, oscillator, EEPROM, and asynchronous serial data bus (UART)
with full modem control signals in a compact 5x5 mm QFN-28 package (sometimes called “MLF” or “MLP”). No
other external USB components are required.
The on-chip EEPROM may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID, Product ID, Product Description String,
Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, and Device Serial Number as desired for OEM applications. The
EEPROM is programmed on-board via the USB, allowing the programming step to be easily integrated into the
product manufacturing and testing process.
Royalty-free Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers provided by Silicon Laboratories allow a CP2103-based
product to appear as a COM port to PC applications. The CP2103 UART interface implements all RS-232/RS-485
signals, including control and handshaking signals; so, existing system firmware does not need to be modified. The
device also features up to four GPIO signals that can be user-defined for status and control information. Support
for I/O interface voltages down to 1.8 V is provided via a VIO pin. In many existing RS-232 designs, all that is
required to update the design from RS-232 to USB is to replace the RS-232 level-translator with the CP2103.
Direct access driver support is available through the Silicon Laboratories USBXpress driver set. Go to
www.silabs.com for the latest application notes and product support information for CP2103.
An evaluation kit for the CP2103 (Part Number: CP2103EK) is available. It includes a CP2103-based USB-to-
UART/RS-232 evaluation board, a complete set of VCP device drivers, USB and RS-232 cables, and complete
documentation. Contact a Silicon Labs sales representatives or visit www.silabs.com to order the CP2103
Evaluation Kit.

4. USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The universal serial bus function controller in the CP2103 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with integrated
transceiver and on-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages all data transfers
between the USB and the UART as well as command requests generated by the USB host controller and
commands for controlling the function of the UART.
The USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both the CP2103 device as well
as external circuitry. The CP2103 will enter Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. Upon
entering Suspend mode, the CP2103 asserts the SUSPEND and SUSPEND signals. SUSPEND and SUSPEND
are also asserted after a CP2103 reset until device configuration during USB Enumeration is complete.
The CP2103 exits the Suspend mode when any of the following events occurs: (1) Resume signaling is detected or
generated, (2) a USB Reset signal is detected, or (3) a device reset occurs. Upon exit from Suspend mode, the
SUSPEND and SUSPEND signals are de-asserted.
Both SUSPEND and SUSPEND temporarily float high during a CP2103 reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a
strong pulldown (10 k) can be used to ensure SUSPEND remains low during reset. See Figure 6 for other
recommended options.

CP2103
5. Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interface
The CP2103 UART interface consists of the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data signals as well as the RTS, CTS,
DSR, DTR, DCD, and RI control signals. The UART supports RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR, and X-On/X-Off handshaking.
The UART can be programmed to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. If the Virtual COM Port drivers
are used, the data format and baud rate are set during COM port configuration on the PC. If the USBXpress drivers
are used, the CP2103 is configured through the USBXpress API. The available data formats and baud rates are
listed in Table 9.
                                      Table 9. Data Formats and Baud Rates

     2. Additional baud rates are supported. See “AN205: CP210x Baud Rate Support”.
     3. 7 or 8 data bits only.
6. GPIO Pins
The CP2103 supports four user-configurable GPIO pins for status and control information. More information
regarding the configuration and use of these pins can be found in “AN144: CP21xx Device Customization Guide”
and “AN223: Port Configuration and GPIO for CP210x” available at www.silabs.com.
7. Internal EEPROM
The CP2103 includes an internal EEPROM that may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID
(PID), Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, and Device Serial Number as
desired for OEM applications. If the EEPROM is not programmed with OEM data, the default configuration data
shown in Table 10 is used.
While customization of the USB configuration data is optional, it is recommended to customize the VID/PID
combination. A unique VID/PID combination prevents the driver from conflicting with any other USB driver. A
vendor ID can be obtained from www.usb.org, or Silicon Labs can provide a free PID for the OEM product that can
be used with the Silicon Laboratories VID. It is also recommended to customize the serial number if the OEM
application is one in which it is possible for multiple CP2103-based devices to be connected to the same PC.
The internal EEPROM is programmed via the USB. This allows the OEM's USB configuration data and serial
number to be written to the CP2103 on-board during the manufacturing and testing process. A stand-alone utility
for programming the internal EEPROM is available from Silicon Labs. A library of routines provided in the form of a
Windows® DLL is also available. This library can be used to integrate the EEPROM programming step into custom
software used by the OEM to streamline testing and serial number management during manufacturing. The
EEPROM has a typical endurance of 100,000 write cycles with a data retention of 100 years. USB descriptors can
be locked to prevent future modification.

8. CP2103 Device Drivers
There are two sets of device drivers available for the CP2103 devices: the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers and the
USBXpress Direct Access drivers. Only one set of drivers is necessary to interface with the device. The latest
drivers are available at http://www.silabs.com/products/microcontroller/downloads.asp.
8.1. Virtual COM Port Drivers
The CP2103 Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2103-based device to appear to the PC's
application software as a COM port. Application software running on the PC accesses the CP2103-based device
as it would access a standard hardware COM port. However, actual data transfer between the PC and the CP2103
device is performed over the USB interface. Therefore, existing COM port applications may be used to transfer
data via the USB to the CP2103-based device without modifying the application. See “AN197: Serial
Communications Guide for the CP210x” for example code for interfacing to a CP2103 using the Virtual COM
drivers.
8.2. USBXpress Drivers
The Silicon Laboratories USBXpress drivers provide an alternate solution for interfacing with CP2103 devices. No
serial port protocol expertise is required. Instead, a simple, high-level application program interface (API) is used to
provide simpler CP201x connectivity and functionality. The USBXpress for CP210x Development Kit includes
Windows device drivers, Windows device driver installers and uninstallers, and a host interface function library
(host API) provided in the form of a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The USBXpress driver set is
recommended for new products that also include new PC software. The USBXpress interface is described in
“AN169: USBXpress® Programmer's Guide.”
8.3. Driver Customization
In addition to customizing the device as described in “7. Internal EEPROM” , the drivers and the drivers installation
package can be also be customized. See “AN220: USB Driver Customization” for more information on generating
customized VCP and USBXpress drivers.
8.4. Driver Certification
The default drivers that are shipped with the CP2103 are Microsoft WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs)
certified. The certification means that the drivers have been tested by Microsoft, and their latest operating systems
(XP and Vista) allow the drivers to be installed without any warnings or errors.
The customized drivers generated using the AN220 software are not automatically certified. They must go first
through the Microsoft Driver Reseller Submission process. Contact Silicon Laboratories support for assistance with
this process.

CP2103
9. Voltage Regulator
The CP2103 includes an on-chip 5 to 3 V voltage regulator. This allows the CP2103 to be configured as either a
USB bus-powered device or a USB self-powered device. These configurations are shown in Figures 7 and 8.
When enabled, the 3 V voltage regulator output appears on the VDD pin and can be used to power external 3 V
devices. See Table 11 for the voltage regulator electrical characteristics.
Alternatively, if 3 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2103 can function as a USB self-powered device with
the voltage regulator disabled. For this configuration, it is recommended that the REGIN input be tied to the 3 V net
to disable the voltage regulator. This configuration is shown in Figure 9.
The USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match the device power usage and configuration. See
“AN144: CP21xx Device Customization Guide” for information on how to customize USB descriptors for the
CP2103.
Note: It is recommended that additional decoupling capacitance (e.g., 0.1 µF in parallel with 1.0 µF) be provided on the REGIN
       input.
