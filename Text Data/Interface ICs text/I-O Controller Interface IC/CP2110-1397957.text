CP2110
1. System Overview
The CP2110 is a highly-integrated HID USB-to-UART Bridge Controller providing a simple solution for updating
RS-232 designs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB space. The CP2110 includes a USB 2.0 full-
speed function controller, USB transceiver, oscillator, one-time programmable ROM, and an asynchronous serial
data bus (UART) in compact 4 x 4 mm QFN24 and 5 x 5 mm QFN28 packages (sometimes called “MLF” or
“MLP”).
The on-chip, one-time programmable ROM provides the option to customize the USB Vendor ID, Product ID,
Manufacturer Product String, Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number, Device Serial
Number, and GPIO configuration as desired for OEM applications.
The CP2110 uses the standard USB HID device class which is natively supported by most operating systems. A
custom driver does not need to be installed for this device. Windows applications communicate with the CP2110
through a Windows DLL which is provided by Silicon Labs. The interface specification for the CP2110 is also
available to enable development of an API for any operating system that supports HID.
Note: The CP2110 devices will not enumerate as a standard HID mouse or keyboard.
The CP2110 UART interface implements all RS-232 signals, including control and hardware handshaking, so
existing system firmware does not need to be modified. The UART capabilities of the CP2110 include baud rate
support from 300 to 1 Mbps, hardware flow control, support for 5-8 data bits, 5 types of parity and RS-485 support.
The device also features a total of 10 GPIO signals that are user-defined for status and control information. Six of
the GPIO signals support alternate features including hardware flow control (RTS and CTS), a configurable clock
output (24 MHz to 47 kHz), RS-485 transceiver control, and TX and RX LED toggle. On the –GM packages,
support for I/O interface voltages down to 1.8 V is provided via a VIO pin. On the -GM1 packages, the VIO pin is
internally tied to VDD.
An evaluation kit for the CP2110 (Part Number: CP2110EK) is available. It includes a CP2110-based USB-to-
UART/RS-232 evaluation board, Windows DLL and test application, USB and RS-232 cables, and full
documentation. See www.silabs.com for the latest application notes and product support information for the
CP2110. Contact a Silicon Labs sales representatives or go to www.silabs.com to order the CP2110 Evaluation Kit.

6. USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) function controller in the CP2110 is a USB 2.0-compliant, full-speed device with
integrated transceiver and on-chip matching and pullup resistors. The USB function controller manages all data
transfers between the USB and the UARTs as well as command requests generated by the USB host controller
and commands for controlling the function of the UARTs and GPIO pins.
The USB Suspend and Resume modes are supported for power management of both the CP2110 device as well
as external circuitry. The CP2110 enters Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. Upon
entering Suspend mode, the Suspend signals are asserted. The Suspend signals are also asserted after a CP2110
reset until device configuration during USB Enumeration is complete. SUSPEND is logic high when the device is in
the Suspend state, and logic low when the device is in normal mode. The SUSPEND pin has the opposite logic
value of the SUSPEND pin.
The CP2110 exits Suspend mode when any of the following occur: Resume signaling is detected or generated, a
USB Reset signal is detected, or a device reset occurs. SUSPEND and SUSPEND are weakly pulled to VIO in a
high impedance state during a CP2110 reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong pulldown (10 k) can be used
to ensure SUSPEND remains low during reset.
The logic level and output mode (push-pull or open-drain) of various pins during USB Suspend is configurable in

7. Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interface
The UART interface consists of the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data signals as well as the optional RTS and
CTS flow control signals. The UART is programmable to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. The data
format and baud rate are set during device configuration on the PC. The data formats and baud rates available to
each interface are listed in Table 12.
                                                         Table 12. Data Formats and Baud Rates

                                  2. Baud rates above 500,000 baud not supported with 5 or 6 data bits.
The baud rate generator for the UART interface is very flexible and allows the user to request any baud rate in the
range from 300 bps to 1 Mbps. If the baud rate cannot be directly generated from the internal 24 MHz oscillator, the
device will choose the closest possible option. The actual baud rate is dictated by Equation 1 and Equation 2.
                                                                24 MHz                                                           Prescale = 4 if Requested Baud Rate  300 bps

                                                                  Equation 1. Clock Divider Calculation
                                                                      24 MHz                                                  Prescale = 4 if Requested Baud Rate  300 bps

Most baud rates can be generated with an error of less than 1.0%. A general rule of thumb for the majority of UART
applications is to limit the baud rate error on both the transmitter and the receiver to no more than ±2%. The clock
divider value obtained in Equation 1 is rounded to the nearest integer, which may produce an error source. Another
error source will be the 24 MHz oscillator, which is accurate to ±0.25%. Knowing the actual and requested baud
rates, the total baud rate error can be found using Equation 3.

The UART also supports the transmission of a line break. The length of time for a line break is programmable from
1 to 125 ms, or it can be set to transmit indefinitely until a stop command is sent from the application.
                                                                                                                  Rev. 1.2                                                     17


CP2110
8. GPIO Pins
The CP2110 supports 10 user-configurable GPIO pins. Each of these GPIO pins are usable as inputs, open-drain
outputs, or push-pull outputs. Six of these GPIO pins also have alternate functions which are listed in Table 13.
More information regarding the configuration and usage of these pins is available in “AN721: CP21xx
Customization Guide” available on the Silicon Labs website.

                                         GPIO.5               RX Toggle
The default configuration for all of the GPIO pins is provided in Table 14. The configuration of the pins is one-time
programmable for each device. See Section 9 for more information about programming the GPIO pin functionality.

       GPIO.2                       CTS                               GPIO.7                   GPIO Input
       GPIO.3           RS-485 Transceiver Control                    GPIO.8             GPIO Push-Pull Output

The difference between an open-drain output and a push-pull output is when the GPIO output is driven to logic
high. A logic high, open-drain output pulls the pin to the VIO rail through an internal, pull-up resistor. A logic high,
push-pull output directly connects the pin to the VIO voltage. Open-drain outputs are typically used when
interfacing to logic at a higher voltage than the VIO pin. These pins can be safely pulled to the higher, external
voltage through an external pull-up resistor. The maximum external pull-up voltage is 5 V.
The speed of reading and writing the GPIO pins is subject to the timing of the USB bus. GPIO pins configured as
inputs or outputs are not recommended for real-time signalling.

8.1. GPIO.0—Clock Output
GPIO.0 is configurable to output a configurable CMOS clock output. The clock output appears at the pin at the
same time the device completes enumeration and exits USB Suspend mode. The clock output is removed from the
pin when the device enters USB Suspend mode. The output frequency is configurable through the use of a divider
and the accuracy is specified in Table 6. When the divider is set to 0, the output frequency is 24 MHz. For divider
values between 1 and 255, the output frequency is determined by the formula:
                                                                    24 MHz

                                                                2  Divider
                                  Equation 4. GPIO.0 Clock Output Frequency
This divider is independent from the divider used to set UART baud rate.
8.2. GPIO.1-2—Hardware Flow Control (RTS and CTS)
By default, GPIO.1 and GPIO.2 are configured to operate as the hardware flow control pins RTS and CTS. In
addition to the GPIO PROM configuration, the device must be configured to use hardware flow control to use these
pins.
RTS, or Ready To Send, is an active-low output from the CP2110 and indicates to the external UART device that
the CP2110’s UART RX FIFO has not reached the watermark level of 450 bytes and is ready to accept more data.
When the amount of data in the RX FIFO reaches the watermark, the CP2110 pulls RTS high to indicate to the
external UART device to stop sending data.
CTS, or Clear To Send, is an active-low input to the CP2110 and is used by the external UART device to indicate to
the CP2110 when the external UART device’s RX FIFO is getting full. The CP2110 will not send more than two
bytes of data once CTS is pulled high.

CP2110
8.3. GPIO.3—RS-485 Transceiver Bus Control
GPIO.3 is configurable as an RS-485 bus transceiver control pin that is connected to the DE and RE inputs of the
transceiver. When configured for RS-485 mode, the pin is asserted during UART data transmission as well as line
break transmission. The RS-485 mode of GPIO.3 is active-high by default, but is also configurable for active-low
mode.

8.4. GPIO.4-5—Transmit and Receive Toggle
GPIO.4 and GPIO.5 are configurable as Transmit Toggle and Receive Toggle pins. These pins are logic high when
a device is not transmitting or receiving data, and they toggle at a fixed rate as specified in Table 6 when data
transfer is in progress. Typically, these pins are connected to two LEDs to indicate data transfer.
                                                                             VIO

9. One-Time Programmable ROM
The CP2110 includes an internal, one-time programmable ROM that may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID
(VID), Product ID (PID), Manufacturer String, Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release
Number, Device Serial Number, GPIO configuration, Suspend Pins and Modes as desired for OEM applications. If
the programmable ROM has not been customized, the default configuration data shown in Table 15 and Table 16 is
used.

While customization of the USB configuration data is optional, customizing the VID/PID combination is strongly
recommended. A unique VID/PID will prevent the device from being recognized by any other manufacturer’s
software application. A vendor ID can be obtained from www.usb.org or Silicon Labs can provide a free PID for the
OEM product that can be used with the Silicon Labs VID. All CP2110 devices are pre-programmed with a unique
serial number. It is important to have a unique serial if it is possible for multiple CP2110-based devices to be
connected to the same PC.
Application Note “AN433: CP2110/4 HID-to-UART API Specification” includes more information about the
programmable values and their valid options. Note that certain items in the PROM are programmed as a group and
programming one of the items in the group prevents further programming of any of the other items in the group.
The configuration data ROM is programmable by Silicon Labs prior to shipment with the desired configuration
information. It can also be programmed in-system over the USB interface by adding a capacitor to the PCB. If the
configuration ROM is to be programmed in-system, a 4.7 µF capacitor must be added between the VPP pin and
ground. No other circuitry should be connected to VPP during a programming operation, and VDD must remain at
3.3 V or higher to successfully write to the configuration ROM.

10. Voltage Regulator
The CP2110 includes an on-chip 5 to 3.45 V voltage regulator. This allows the CP2110 to be configured as either a
USB bus-powered device or a USB self-powered device. A typical connection diagram of the device in a bus-
powered application using the regulator is shown in Figure 11. When enabled, the voltage regulator output appears
on the VDD pin and can be used to power external devices. See Table 5 for the voltage regulator electrical
characteristics.
If the regulator is used to provide VDD in a self-powered application, use the same connections from Figure 11, but
connect REGIN to an on-board 5 V supply, and disconnect it from the VBUS pin. In addition, if REGIN may be un-
powered while VBUS is 5 V, a resistor divider shown in Note 5 of Figure 12 is required to meet the absolute
maximum voltage on VBUS specification in Table 1.

Alternatively, if 3.0 to 3.6 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2110 can function as a USB self-powered
device with the voltage regulator bypassed. For this configuration, tie the REGIN input to VDD to bypass the voltage
regulator. A typical connection diagram showing the device in a self-powered application with the regulator
bypassed is shown in Figure 12.
The USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match the device power usage and configuration. See
application note “AN721: CP21xx Customization Guide” for information on how to customize USB descriptors for
the CP2110.

CP2110
11. CP2110 Interface Specification and Windows Interface DLL
The CP2110 is a USB Human Interface Device (HID), and as most operating systems include native HID drivers,
custom drivers do not need to be installed. The CP2110 does not fit one of the standard HID device types, such as
a keyboard or mouse, and so any CP2110 PC application needs to use the CP2110’s HID specification to
communicate with the device. The low-level HID specification for the CP2110 is provided in “AN434: CP2110/4
Interface Specification.” This document describes all of the basic functions for opening, reading from, writing to,
and closing the device as well as the ROM programming functions.
A Windows DLL that encapsulates the CP2110 HID interface and also adds higher level features such as read/
write time-outs is provided by Silicon Labs. This DLL is the recommended interface for the CP2110. The Windows
DLL is documented in CP2110 Windows DLL Specification.
Both of these documents and the DLL are available in the CP2110EK CD as well as online at
http://www.silabs.com/.
