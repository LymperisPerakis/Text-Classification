The MAX5942A/MAX5942B integrate a complete power                     ♦ Powered Device Interface
IC for powered devices (PD) in a power-over-ethernet                    Fully Integrated IEEE 802.3af-Compliant PD
(PoE) system. The MAX5942A/MAX5942B provide a PD                        Interface
interface and a compact DC-DC PWM controller suitable                   PD Detection and Programmable Classification
for flyback and forward converters in either isolated or                Signatures
nonisolated designs.                                                    Less than 10µA Leakage Current Offset During
The MAX5942A/MAX5942B PD interface complies with                        Detection
the IEEE™ 802.3af standard, providing the PD with a                     Integrated MOSFET for Isolation and Inrush
detection signature, a classification signature, and an                 Current Limiting
integrated isolation switch with programmable inrush cur-               Gate Output Allows External Control of the
rent control. These devices also feature power-mode                     Internal Isolation FET
undervoltage lockout (UVLO) with wide hysteresis and                    Programmable Inrush Current Control/ULVO
power-good status outputs.                                              PGOOD/PGOOD Outputs Enable PWM

range power supplies. A high-voltage startup circuit
allows the PWM controller to draw power directly from the               Current-Mode Control
18V to 67V input supply during startup. The switching                   Leading-Edge Blanking

                    absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1:  All min/max limits for the PD interface are production tested at +85°C (extended grade)/+70°C (commercial grade). Limits
         at +25°C and -40°C are guaranteed by design. All PWM controller min/max limits are 100% production tested at +25°C
         and +85°C (extended grade)/+70°C (commercial grade). Limits at -40°C are guaranteed by design, unless otherwise
         noted.
Note 2: The input offset current is illustrated in Figure 1.
Note 3: Effective differential input resistance is defined as the differential resistance between GND and VEE without any external
         resistance.
Note 4: Classification current is turned off whenever the IC is in power mode.
Note 5: See Table 2 in the PD Classification Mode section. RDISC and RCL must be 100ppm or better.
Note 6: See Thermal Dissipation section for details.
Note 7: When UVLO is connected to the midpoint of an external resistor-divider with a series resistance of 25.5kΩ (±1%), the turn-
         on threshold set point for the power mode is defined by the external resistor-divider. Make sure the voltage on the UVLO
         pin does not exceed its maximum rating of 8V when VIN is at the maximum voltage.
Note 8: When the VUVLO is below VTH, G, UVLO, the MAX5942_ sets the turn-on voltage threshold internally (VUVLO,ON).
Note 9: An input voltage or VUVLO glitch below their respective thresholds shorter than or equal to tOFF_DLY will not cause the
         MAX5942A/MAX5942B to exit power-on mode (as long as the input voltage remains above an operable voltage level of 12V).
Note 10: PGOOD references to OUT while PGOOD references to VEE.
Note 11: Guaranteed by design.
