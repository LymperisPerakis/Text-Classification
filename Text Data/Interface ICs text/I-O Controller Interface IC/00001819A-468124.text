SIO10N268
Description
The SIO10N268 is a single chip I/O device that can be used on the ISA or LPC bus. Bus selection is accomplished as
a jumper option. Offering the same part with two system busses enables easy migration from an ISA architecture to the
LPC generation enabling the preservation of design techniques and BIOS.
The SIO10N268 is a 3.3V operational (5.0V tolerant), PC 99/2001, and ACPI 1.0 compliant Super I/O Controller. This
device includes Microchip’s true CMOS 765B floppy disk controller with advanced digital data separator and Microchip’s
Multi-Mode parallel port with ChiProtect circuitry plus EPP and ECP support.
The part also includes 33 GPIO pins, support for two LED’s with blinking option, and a WatchDog Timer (WDT) with
optional output pin. The SIO10N268 includes (4) 16C550 compatible UARTs. One UART includes additional support for
a Serial Infrared Interface that complies with IrDA v1.2 (Fast IR), HPSIR, and ASKIR formats, as well as Consumer IR.
SIO10N268, when LPC Mode is selected, implements the LPC bus interface. In this mode, the X-Bus Interface is
enabled to interface to external I/O devices that have an 8-bit data bus and to standard ISA memory devices, up to 2MB,
which can serve as BIOS flash.
SIO10N268, when ISA Mode is selected, supports the ISA Plug-and-Play Standard (Version 1.0a). The I/O Address,
DMA Channel and Hardware IRQ of each device in the part may be reprogrammed through the internal configuration
registers.
                                             TO OUR VALUED CUSTOMERS
  It is our intention to provide our valued customers with the best documentation possible to ensure successful use of your Microchip

  E-mail at docerrors@microchip.com. We welcome your feedback.
  Most Current Data Sheet
  To obtain the most up-to-date version of this data sheet, please register at our Worldwide Web site at:
         http://www.microchip.com
  You can determine the version of a data sheet by examining its literature number found on the bottom outside corner of any page.
  The last character of the literature number is the version number, (e.g., DS30000000A is version A of document DS30000000).
  Errata
  An errata sheet, describing minor operational differences from the data sheet and recommended workarounds, may exist for cur-
  rent devices. As device/documentation issues become known to us, we will publish an errata sheet. The errata will specify the
  revision of silicon and revision of document to which it applies.
  To determine if an errata sheet exists for a particular device, please check with one of the following:
  • Microchip’s Worldwide Web site; http://www.microchip.com
  • Your local Microchip sales office (see last page)
  When contacting a sales office, please specify which device, revision of silicon and data sheet (include -literature number) you are
  using.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR
    OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
