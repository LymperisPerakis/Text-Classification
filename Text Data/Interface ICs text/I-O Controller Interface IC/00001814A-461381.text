LPC47N267
Description
The Microchip LPC47N267 is a 3.3V PC 99 and ACPI 1.0 compliant Super I/O Controller. The LPC47N267 implements
an LPC interface, a pin reduced ISA interface, for supported I/O and DMA cycles. In addition, this part includes an X-
Bus interface that may be accessed through the LPC interface for supported I/O cycles (memory cycles are not sup-
ported by this device). The X-Bus interface supports as many as four external components and it offers three different
modes of operation for interfacing with these components. The X-Bus interface has an added “Write Protect” feature
that ensures that the Base Address and disable bit for each component can only be set by the BIOS to prevent corrup-
tion by any virus software. This part also includes 29 GPIO pins.
The LPC47N267 incorporates Microchip’s true CMOS 765B floppy disk controller, advanced digital data separator, 16-
byte data FIFO, two 16C550 compatible UARTs, one Multi-Mode parallel port with ChiProtect circuitry plus EPP and
ECP support and one floppy direct drive support. The LPC47N267 does not require any external filter components, is
easy to use and offers lower system cost and reduced board area. The LPC47N267 is software and register compatible
with Microchip’s proprietary 82077AA core.
The true CMOS 765B core provides 100% compatibility with IBM PC/XT and PC/AT architectures and provides data
overflow and underflow protection. The Microchip advanced digital data separator incorporates Microchip’s patented
data separator technology allowing for ease of testing and use. The LPC47N267 supports both 1Mbps and 2Mbps data
rates and vertical recording operation at 1Mbps Data Rate.
The LPC47N267 also features a full 16-bit internally decoded address bus, a Serial IRQ interface with PCI nCLKRUN
support, relocatable configuration ports and three DMA channel options.
Both on-chip UARTs are compatible with the NS16C550. One UART includes additional support for a Serial Infrared
Interface that complies with IrDA v1.2 (Fast IR), HPSIR, and ASKIR formats (used by Sharp and other PDAs), as well
as Consumer IR.
The parallel port is compatible with IBM PC/AT architectures, as well as IEEE 1284 EPP and ECP. The parallel port
ChiProtect circuitry prevents damage caused by an attached powered printer when the LPC47N267 is not powered.
The LPC47N267 incorporates sophisticated power control circuitry (PCC). The PCC supports multiple low power down
modes. The LPC47N267 also features Software Configurable Logic (SCL) for ease of use. SCL allows programmable
system configuration of key functions such as the FDC, parallel port, and UARTs.
The LPC47N267 supports the ISA Plug-and-Play Standard (Version 1.0a) and provides the recommended functionality
to support Windows ‘95/’98 and PC99. The I/O Address, DMA Channel and Hardware IRQ of each device in the
LPC47N267 may be reprogrammed through the internal configuration registers. There are 192 I/O address location
options, a Serialized IRQ interface, and three DMA channels.

 Most Current Data Sheet
 To obtain the most up-to-date version of this data sheet, please register at our Worldwide Web site at:
        http://www.microchip.com
 You can determine the version of a data sheet by examining its literature number found on the bottom outside corner of any page.
 The last character of the literature number is the version number, (e.g., DS30000000A is version A of document DS30000000).
 Errata
 An errata sheet, describing minor operational differences from the data sheet and recommended workarounds, may exist for cur-
 rent devices. As device/documentation issues become known to us, we will publish an errata sheet. The errata will specify the
 revision of silicon and revision of document to which it applies.
 To determine if an errata sheet exists for a particular device, please check with one of the following:
 • Microchip’s Worldwide Web site; http://www.microchip.com
 • Your local Microchip sales office (see last page)
 When contacting a sales office, please specify which device, revision of silicon and data sheet (include -literature number) you are
 using.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.
•     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
      knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
      Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
      mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO

OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
