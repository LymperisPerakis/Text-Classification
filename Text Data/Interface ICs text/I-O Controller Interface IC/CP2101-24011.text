1.     System Overview
The CP2101 is a highly-integrated USB-to-UART Bridge Controller providing a simple solution for updating
RS-232 designs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB space. The CP2101 includes a USB
2.0 full-speed function controller, USB transceiver, oscillator, EEPROM and asynchronous serial data bus
(UART) with full modem control signals in a compact 5 x 5 mm QFN-28 package. No other external USB
components are required.
The on-chip EEPROM may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID, Product ID, Product Description
String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number and Device Serial Number as desired for OEM applica-
tions. The EEPROM is programmed on-board via the USB allowing the programming step to be easily inte-
grated into the product manufacturing and testing process.
Royalty-free Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers provided by Silicon Laboratories allow a CP2101-
based product to appear as a COM port to PC applications. The CP2101 UART interface implements all
RS-232 signals, including control and handshaking signals, so existing system firmware does not need to
be modified. In many existing RS-232 designs, all that is required to update the design from RS-232 to
USB is to replace the RS-232 level-translator with the CP2101. Direct access driver support is available
through the Silicon Laboratories USBXpress driver set.
The CP2101 is a mature product and is not recommended for new designs. The CP2102 is a pin and soft-
ware compatible alternative for the CP2101. The CP2102 is recommended for all new designs. Contact
Silicon Laboratories customer support at www.silabs.com for any questions about replacing the CP2101.

CP2101
5.    USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The Universal Serial Bus function controller in the CP2101 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with
integrated transceiver and on-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages
all data transfers between the USB and the UART as well as command requests generated by the USB
host controller and commands for controlling the function of the UART.
The USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both the CP2101 device
as well as external circuitry. The CP2101 will enter Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected
on the bus. On entering Suspend mode, the CP2101 asserts the SUSPEND and SUSPEND signals.
SUSPEND and SUSPEND are also asserted after a CP2101 reset until device configuration during USB
Enumeration is complete
The CP2101 exits the Suspend mode when any of the following occur: (1) Resume signaling is detected or
generated, (2) a USB Reset signal is detected, or (3) a device reset occurs. On exit of Suspend mode, the
SUSPEND and SUSPEND signals are de-asserted.
Both SUSPEND and SUSPEND temporarily float high during a CP2101 reset. If this behavior is undesir-
able, a strong pulldown (10 k) can be used to ensure SUSPEND remains low during reset. See
Figure 5.1 for other recommended options.

6.     Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interface
The CP2101 UART interface consists of the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data signals as well as the
RTS, CTS, DSR, DTR, DCD and RI control signals. The UART supports RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR and X-On/X-
Off handshaking.
The UART is programmable to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. If the Virtual COM Port
drivers are used, the data format and baud rate are set during COM port configuration on the PC. If the
USBXpress drivers are used, the CP2101 is configured through the USBXpress API. The data formats
and baud rates available are listed in Table 6.1.

7.     Internal EEPROM
The CP2101 includes an internal EEPROM that may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Prod-
uct ID (PID), Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number and Device Serial
Number as desired for OEM applications. If the EEPROM is not programmed with OEM data, the default
configuration data shown in Table 7.1 is used.
While customization of the USB configuration data is optional, it is recommended to customize the VID/PID
combination. A unique VID/PID combination will prevent the driver from conflicting with any other USB
driver. A vendor ID can be obtained from www.usb.org or Silicon Laboratories can provide a free PID for
the OEM product that can be used with the Silicon Laboratories VID. It is also recommended to customize
the serial number if the OEM application is one in which it is possible for multiple CP2101-based devices to
be connected to the same PC.
The internal EEPROM is programmed via the USB. This allows the OEM's USB configuration data and
serial number to be written to the CP2101 on-board during the manufacturing and testing process. A
stand-alone utility for programming the internal EEPROM is available from Silicon Laboratories. A library of
routines provided in the form of a Windows® DLL is also available. This library can be used to integrate the
EEPROM programming step into custom software used by the OEM to streamline testing and serial num-
ber management during manufacturing. The EEPROM has a typical endurance of 100,000 write cycles
with a data retention of 100 years.

8.     CP2101 Device Drivers
There are two sets of device drivers available for the CP2101 devices: the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers
and the USBXpress Direct Access drivers. Only one set of drivers is necessary to interface with the
device.
The latest drivers are available at http://www.silabs.com/products/microcontroller/downloads.asp.
8.1.     Virtual COM Port Drivers
The CP2101 Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2101-based device to appear to the PC's
application software as a COM port. Application software running on the PC accesses the CP2101-based
device as it would access a standard hardware COM port. However, actual data transfer between the PC
and the CP2101 device is performed over the USB interface. Therefore, existing COM port applications
may be used to transfer data via the USB to the CP2101-based device without modifying the application.
See Application Note AN197: Code for Example Code for Interfacing to a CP2102 using the Virtual COM
drivers.
8.2.     USBXpress Drivers
The Silicon Laboratories USBXpress drivers provide an alternate solution for interfacing with CP2102
devices. No Serial Port protocol expertise is required. Instead, a simple, high-level application program
interface (API) is used to provide simpler CP201x connectivity and functionality. The USBXpress for
CP210x Development Kit includes Windows device drivers, Windows device driver installer and uninstall-
ers, and a host interface function library (host API) provided in the form of a Windows Dynamic Link
Library (DLL). The USBXpress driver set is recommended for new products that also include new PC soft-
ware. The USBXpress interface is described in Application Note “AN169: USBXpress Programmer's
Guide.”
8.3.     Driver Customization
In addition to customizing the device as described in Section 7. "Internal EEPROM" on page 13, the driv-
ers and the drivers installation package can be also be customized. See Application Note “AN220: USB
Driver Customization” for more information on generating customized VCP and USBXpress drivers.
8.4.     Driver Certification
The default drivers that are shipped with the CP2101 are Microsoft WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality
Labs) certified. The certification means that the drivers have been tested by Microsoft and their latest
operating systems (XP and Vista) will allow the drivers to be installed without any warnings or errors.
The customized drivers that are generated using the AN220 software are not automatically certified. They
must go first through the Microsoft Driver Reseller Submission process. Contact Silicon Laboratories sup-
port for assistance with this process.

9.     Voltage Regulator
The CP2101 includes an on-chip 5-to-3 V voltage regulator. This allows the CP2101 to be configured as
either a USB bus-powered device or a USB self-powered device. These configurations are shown in
Figure 9.1 and Figure 9.2. When enabled, the 3 V voltage regulator output appears on the VDD pin and can
be used to power external 3V devices. See Table 9.1 for the voltage regulator electrical characteristics.
Alternatively, if 3 V power is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2101 can function as a USB self-powered
device with the voltage regulator disabled. For this configuration, it is recommended that the REGIN input
be tied to the 3 V net to disable the voltage regulator. This configuration is shown in Figure 9.3.
The USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match the device power usage and configura-
tion. See application note “AN144: CP2101 Customization Guide” for information on how to customize USB
descriptors for the CP2101.
Note: It is recommended that additional decoupling capacitance (e.g., 0.1 µF in parallel with 1.0 µF) be pro-
vided on the REGIN input.
