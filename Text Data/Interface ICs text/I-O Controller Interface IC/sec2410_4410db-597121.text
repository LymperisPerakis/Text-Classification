General Description
            SEC2410/SEC4410 is a flash media card reader solution intended to provide a flexible means of
            providing embedded Audio/video systems (TVs, DVD players, STBs, Portable Media Copiers or
            Players, etc. ) access to Media files store d on Fl ash Media C ards such as Se cure
            Digital/MultiMediaCard (SD/MMC), and NAND Flash.
            SEC2410/SEC4410 is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 Specification. All required transivers and
            resistors of the USB ports are integrated into the device. This includes all series termination resistors
            on D+ and D- pins and all required pull-down and pull-up resistors. The over-current sense inputs for
            the downstream facing ports have internal pull-up resistors. One Control, One interrupt Pair, and Two
            Bulk Pair Endpoints are provided with reconfigurable Endpoint Buffers.
            SEC2410/SEC4410 incorporates a powerfull ARM M3 32-bit microprocessor with 60 MHz execution
            speed at 1 cycles per instruction (minimum).

                Hardware support for SDIO (SD Input/Output)
            It has on-chip power FET's for supplying flash media card power with minimum board components.
            SEC2410/SEC4410 supports SmartCard interface, ISO/IEC 7816 compliant and has Integrated 3/1.8
            Volt regulator.
            Integrated cryptographical module offers AES encryption with AES 128, AES 192, AES 256 key sizes
            and ECB, CBC or CTR implementation.
            SEC2410/SEC4410 offers up to 32 GPIOs with diverse configuration and polarity options for special
            function such as LED indicators, button inputs, and power control to memory devices. The number of
            actual GPIOs depends on the implemented configuration. One GPIO available with up to 200 mA drive
            and “fold-back” short circuit protection
            SEC2410/SEC4410 has a 24 MHz Crystal Driver Circuit and internal PLL for 480 MHz USB 2.0
            Sampling on board.
