Thunderbolt™ 3 Controllers
Thunderbolt™ 3: The USB-C That Does It All
Thunderbolt™ 3 delivers a single cable, multi-purpose I/O solution at speeds up to 40 Gbps, creating one
compact port that does it all – delivering today’s fastest,1 most versatile connection to any dock, display,
or data device. With Thunderbolt 3, one computer port connects to Thunderbolt devices, every display, and
billions of USB devices. A single cable now provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of
any other solution, while also supplying power. It’s unrivaled for new uses, such as single-cable docks with
charging, docking displays, super-fast storage, external graphics, and 10 GbE networking. Simply put,
Thunderbolt 3 delivers the best USB-C.
Thunderbolt Overview
Fundamentally, Thunderbolt is a tunneling architecture designed to combine underlying protocols onto
a single interface so that the total speed and performance of the link can be shared between the usages
of these protocols allowing Thunderbolt 3 to deliver data, display, and power all over a single cable.
Thunderbolt 3 provides more protocols, more speed, more pixels, and more power.

to that downstream port. If each consecutive device is a Thunderbolt
device, up to six devices in a chain can be supported.
