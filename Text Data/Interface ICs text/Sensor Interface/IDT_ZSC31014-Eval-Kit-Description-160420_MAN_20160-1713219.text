The ZSC31014 SSC Evaluation Kit contains the software and hardware needed for communication and calibra-
tion of a ZSC31014 sensor signal conditioning IC. A user’s PC can communicate with a ZSC31014 socketed on
the SSC Evaluation Board via an SSC Communication Board through a USB connection. The software should
function on any Windows® 2000/XP/ Vista / Windows® 7 system after installation of a USB driver. Both the SSC
Evaluation Board and the Sensor Replacement Board (SRB) can provide a replacement for a sensor. Only one of
these can be used at a time for calibration as determined by the settings of jumpers K6 and K7 (see Figure 2.1).
On the SRB, the sensor replacement is controlled by a potentiometer (see Figure 1.1). The SRB can be
disconnected if the SSC Evaluation Board’s sensor replacement (artificial bridge stimulus) will be used.

2       ZSC31014 SSC Evaluation Board
2.1. Overview
The main purpose of the SSC Evaluation System is communication between the PC and the ZSC31014 (referred
to as the DUT). The PC sends commands and data via the USB port on the CB (virtual com port). The
                                                                                                               2
microcontroller on the SSC CB interprets these commands and relays them to the ZSC31014 in the I C bus
standard format (K1 Pin 9/SCL Pin 11/SCK). The microcontroller will also forward any data bytes from the
ZSC31014 back to the PC via the USB connection. These bytes can be bridge and temperature readings to be
displayed by the PC software, raw ADC readings used during calibration, or EEPROM content bytes.
                                                                           1

                                                                                      ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
2.2. Connections to the ZSC31014
The SSC Evaluation Board has an SOP-8 socket for inserting the ZSC31014.
Using the VDD, GND, SDA/MISO, SCL/SCLK and INT/SS/ connections on connector K5 on the SSC Evaluation
Board, the board can be used for in-circuit programming of the ZSC31014 in the user’s calibration fixture.
NOTE: Only one ASIC connection option can be used at a time.
2.3. Power Supply to the Board
The K1 connector to the SSC CB provides the power supply from the SSC CB’s USB port to the SSC Evaluation
Board. Using the power via the USB port, the maximum current that can be provided is 40mA. All functions of the
board are operative down to 2.7V. The board has a red LED labeled D1, which lights if the board has power.
The current consumption of the ZSC31014 can be measured by removing the jumper on 2-pin connector K9 and
reading across the pins with an ammeter.
2.4. Reset Switch
During operation, use the push button on the Communication Board to reset communications if needed.
2.5. Connecting a Customer Module to the SCC Evaluation Board
A customer-specific sensor module usually includes a bridge sensor and a ZSC31014 contained in a protective
casing. These modules provide access to Vdd, GND, SCL, and SDA pins via extended wires. These wires should
be connected to the corresponding pins of K5 (refer to Figure 2.1; pins are indicated with green shading) on the
ZSC31014 SSC Evaluation Board for evaluation and programming of the module. The packaged ZSC31014 chip
must be removed from the IC socket when an external module is connected to the SSC Evaluation Board.
A universal test board (refer to Figure 2.2) is also available for users who would like to use ZSC31014 in an SOP8
package and make connections to the ZSC31014 SSC Evaluation Board via pins on K5. The universal test board
supports first test applications for IDT’s different SSOP/SOP packaging.

                                                                                    ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
2.6. Connecting an External Bridge and External Temperature Sensor to the SSC
       Evaluation Board
Use the Excel™ file ZSC31014_iLite_Ext_Temperature_Meas_RevX.x.xls to determine the value of the PTC.
Follow these steps for connecting an external bridge and external temperature sensor to the SSC Evaluation
Board:
    •  Remove the SRB and open the jumpers on K5 and K6 (refer to Figure 2.1).
    •  Connect the external bridge to KL1: VBR, VINP and VINN.
    •  Important: Leave VSSB open. Connect the bridge bottom to the Bsink pin on K3.
    •  Short K3 VSSB to GND.
    •  Solder the top of the PTC resistor to pin 10 on terminal block K4 (BSINK).
    •  Solder the bottom of PTC resistor to pin 9 on terminal block K4 (VSS)
3      Installing and Setting up the Software and USB Drivers
3.1. Installing the ZSC31014 iLiteTester™ Software
The ZSC31014 SSC Evaluation Kit DVD contains a setup program (setup.exe), which automatically installs the
iLiteTester™ software when clicked. Follow the dialog boxes to complete the installation, which automatically
creates a shortcut on the PC desktop. Clicking this icon opens the ZSC31014 iLiteTester™ software for evalu-
ating and calibrating ZSC31014 modules, which can also be used for the ZSC31014 SSC Mass Calibration Kit.
Important: Before using the ZSC31014 iLiteTester™ software, install the USB drivers as described below. When
the software is activated for the first time, the COM port must be selected and the ZSC31014 silicon revision must
be entered as described in section 3.3 and 3.4.
3.2. Installing the USB Drivers
The ZSC31014 SSC Evaluation Kit requires installation of two USB drivers. To install the drivers, the user’s
system must meet these requirements:
    •  5x86-compatible PC
    •  32 MB RAM
    •  Hard drive with 20MB free space
    •  USB port
    •  Windows® 2000/XP/ Vista / Windows® 7
The two required driver files are in the USB_Driver folder on the DVD. These drivers will make the PC’s USB port
appear as a virtual COM port (typically COM3 or COM4 on most computers). The ZSC31014 iLiteTester™
software accesses the SSC Evaluation Board through the CB as if it were a COM (RS232) port. These drivers will
not affect the operation of any other USB peripherals. Refer to SSC_AN_CommunicationBoard_Driver_Installa-

3.3.    “Find Com” on the Setup Menu
After installing the software and the USB drivers, activate the software. The ZSC31014 iLiteTester™ software
automatically detects which type of IDT evaluation board is connected. To set up communication with the SSC
CB, click on “Setup” and then “Find COM.” Click “Yes” in the resulting dialog box if the COM port selected is
acceptable. If not, click “No” until an acceptable COM port is found.
If communication fails, an error message detailing the reason for failure will be displayed. For a full list of all com-
munication-related error messages, see the “Error-Code” tab in SSC_CommunicationBoard_CommandSyntax_
Rev_X_x.xls.

4        ZSC31014 iLiteTester™ Software
4.1. Overview
The IDT software provided with the ZSC31014 SSC Evaluation Kit is intended for demonstration purposes and
                                                                                              2
calibration of single units. The installation folder is (C:\\program files\ZMDI\ZSC31014) . IDT can provide the user
with algorithms and assistance in developing their full production calibration software. Five types of text files
support the software user:
4.1.1.        Log Files
                                                                      1
These files are saved in C:\\My Documents\ZMDI\ZSC31014
     • When the software is activated and the communication port is opened, a CommLog.txt file is saved. This
         file is a log of the communication to the IC during the software session and can be saved after closing the
         software by renaming the file. Otherwise, it would be overwritten the next time the software is opened.
     • In Command Mode (CM) the user can save/load the EEPROM contents from a *.eep file to the EEPROM
         and vise versa.
     • In Normal Operation Mode (NOM) the user can log bridge and temperature readings to the DataLog.txt file.
     • The calibration is documented in the CalibrationLog.txt file, which is more convenient for users than the
         caldata.txt file.
4.1.2.        Data File caldata.txt
                        2
The caldata.txt file is used by the software for calibration. Its structure is explained in Appendix B. Depending on
the Windows system, the file is saved in one of the following locations:
     • for Windows 2000 and Windows XP
          in C:\\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\ZMDI\ZSC31014
     • for Windows Vista
         C:\\ProgramData\ZMDI\ZSC31014
4.2. Bridge and Temperature Display
The software displays two large readout windows for temperature and bridge values (see Figure 4.1). The
                                                               o
temperature reading is the ZSC31014 temperature in C. The bridge reading is in %. Calibration determines the
relationship of the % reading to the value the bridge is measuring. If the ZSC31014 has not been temperature
calibrated, the displayed temperature is invalid.
There is a continuous transmission of bridge readings and temperature readings.

                                                                                       ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
The ZSC31014 is designed to be a generic resistive bridge conditioner, but for the following calibration example,
assume it is connected to a pressure bridge. If the unit is calibrated to read pressure with 50kPa reading as 100%
and 10kPa reading as 0%, then the span of pressure readings would be 40kPa. Half of that span (20kPa) plus the
set zero point (10kPa) should be the 50% point. After calibration, if the chamber is set to 30kPa, theZSC31014
should give a 50% reading.
4.3.    “Log File” Field
Bridge and temperature readings can be logged to a PC file. Use the “Browse” button to select the filename and
directory where the file will be stored. Then click “Open.” The “Sample Rate” field sets how often the data is col-
lected. If the sample rate is 0 sec, then an entry is written for each transmission from the ZSC31014.
The resulting text file is a space-delimited ASCII file and can be imported into Microsoft Excel.
4.4. “Start CM” Button
To communicate to the ZSC31014, start the Command Mode (full command set, measurement cycle stopped) by
clicking “START CM” (Start Command Mode).
4.5. “Start NOM” Button
To exit Command Mode and return the ZSC31014 to Normal Operation Mode (reading, conditioning and trans-
mitting bridge data), click “START NOM” (Start Normal Operation Mode).
Note: For the ZSC31014, the NOM is recommended for the raw value collection during the calibration.
4.6. “Normal Mode” Section
“Run Continuous” Button
To start a continuous readout of bridge and temperature data, click the “Run Continuous” button.
“Sample Rate” Field
This field sets the period (ms) for the sample rate of the continuous read out. Valid settings are 10ms or longer.
“Average Samples” Field
This feature allows averaging the measured values by choosing the number of samples to average before
displaying the result. Note this is a running average, so increasing the number to average increases the display’s
settling time but does not affect the update rate.

4.8. “Communication and Operation Config” Section
This section is used to expedite programming configuration and communication settings in the EEPROM of the
ZSC31014 under test.
“Comm Type” Menu
Three communication options are available on the “Comm Type” drop-down menu:
     • I2C
     • SPI (pos edge): SPI / MISO changes on positive edge clock frequency
     • SPI (neg edge): SPI / MISO changes on negative edge clock frequency
“Clock Freq” Menu
Select 1MHz or 4MHz for the clock frequency for the ZSC31014 using the “Clock Freq” drop-down menu. The
lower clock frequency (1MHz) is the recommend selection for lower power and better noise performance. If faster
response time is required, the 4MHz clock frequency setting is needed.
“I2C Addr” Field
                                2
When the ZSC31014 is in I C communication mode, the default slave address is 28HEX. If a different slave
address is required, program the part for the new address by entering the hex value of the new address in the
“I2C Addr” field and then click “Write Addr.” The valid address range is 00HEX to 7FHEX.
Note: If the “Lock I2C Address” is on (see below), “I2C Addr” must match the “I2C Comm Addr” setting (see
section 3.5).
“Lock I2C Address” Checkbox
Lock the slave address selection by clicking “Lock I2C Address” checkbox. Without this lock, the IC will respond
to all I2C addresses.
“Sleep Mode” Checkbox
To select the Sleep Mode, click on the “Sleep Mode” checkbox; otherwise, the Update Rate Mode is selected as
the default mode. The Sleep Mode enables the most power saving mode of the ZSC31014.

“Update_Rate” Menu
When operating in Update Mode, the update rate determines power consumption and response time. Select the
update rate by clicking on one of the four update rates on the “Update_Rate” drop-down menu.
“Sensor Short Check” Checkbox
To enable the sensor short diagnostic, click on the “Sensor Short Check” checkbox.
“Sensor Connection Check” Checkbox
To enable the sensor open diagnostic, click on the “Sensor Connection Check” checkbox.
Note This check must be disabled when using the modular Sensor Replacement Board for evaluation. Its dummy
bridge is actually only a half bridge and will always report a diagnostic case. For more details refer to the
ZSC31014 RbiciLite™ Data Sheet.
4.9. Math Config Section
“SOT_Curve” Menu
Some sensors perform better when compensated with a second order term (SOT) based on a zero-point
                                     6
symmetrical output function (S-shaped) instead of the parabolic curve function used to compensate more
common sensors. The curve type is controlled by SOT_Curve (bit 9 in EEPROM word 01HEX). Select the curve
type from the “SOT_Curve” drop-down menu. When the S-shaped curve is selected, the zero point is in the
                                                                                                     nd
middle of the output and a negative and positive output signal can be compensated using only the 2 order term.
“Negative Coeffs” Subsection
The Tco, Tcg, SOT_Bridge, SOT_Tco, SOT_Tcg and SOT_T checkboxes in the “Negative Coeffs” section
indicate the sign of the calculated calibration coefficients after calibration.
4.10. “Front End Config” Section
In the “Front End Config” section, select the configuration for the AFE (Analog Front End) as determined from the
bridge sensor performance before starting calibration. The configuration for the temperature depends on the
choice of an internal or external temperature sensor. For the internal sensor, a default calibration word is
configured. Additional selections are available in the “Calibration/Set ASIC Configuration” window (click
“Calibration” to initialize).
Note: The Excel™ file ZSC31014_AFE_Configuration.xls can be used to determine the correct adjustment of the
analog PreAmp gain and the analog A2D offset modes based on the known sensor characteristics. The
Excel™sheet ZSC31014_iLite_ext_Temperaturemeasurement.xls can be used to determine the configuration for
external temperature sensors.

                                                                                     ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
“A2D_Offset” Menu
To help compensate for bridges that have a large inherent offset, the ZSC31014 has eleven programmable
analog offset modes for bridge and temperature measurements. See Table 5.1 for the A2D offset settings.
Use the “A2D_Offset” drop-down menus for “Bridge” and “Temperature” to select the A2D offset mode settings,
which are stored in EEPROM.
The [-1/2, 1/2] mode is best for a balanced bridge [-50mV, 50mV] @ VDD=5V (Pre-Amp=24).The [-1/16, 15/16]
mode is best for positive-skewed bridges [-10mV, 90mV] @VDD=5V (Pre-Amp=24).
Note: For ZSC31014 silicon revision D and higher, T_Config is configured individually to the specific internal
temperature sensor during the final test and should not be changed. If this configuration is lost, it can be restored
using the Temperature A2D Offset Mode shown in the Excel™ file ZSC31014 Trim_Internal TempSensorT_Con-
fig.xls.
Figure 4.3 Select Temperature A2D_Offset
The Gain_T is always 6. For more details, refer to ZSC31014 Trim_Internal TempSensorT_Config.xls.
Note for External Temperature Sensors: The A2D_Offset is always [-1/16, 15/16] if the “Positive Gain” setting is
on, and [-15/16, 1/16] if it is off.
Note: As a single ended input, the temperature input signal must fit in the voltage range 1V to (VDD/2-1.2V).

                                                                                                           ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
“PreAmp_Gain” Menu
The ZSC31014 PreAmp amplifies the bridge signal to produce the differential signal that will be converted by the
                                                                                                                                  7
ADC. The PreAmp has eight possible analog gain settings: 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24 (default), 48, 96, and 192 . Use the
“PreAmp_Gain” drop-down menus for “Bridge” and “Temperature” to select the PreAmp gain settings, which are
stored in EEPROM. (Note: This term is different from the digital gain terms Gain_B and Gain_T, which are
multiplied by the result of the ADC to compensate sensor span for bridge and temperature measurements.)
Any bridge input signal greater than 40mV/V in differential mode will saturate the pre-amp if the gain is set to 24
(default). In this case, the pre-amp gain must be set to the lower value 12.
For very small differential input signals, the higher analog gain (e.g., 40) can improve the output resolution (see
section 1.4 in the data sheet), but the sensor offset must always be considered as well as sensor span. Both the
offset and span of the sensor are amplified by the pre-amp. With a high analog gain (48), the total offset plus span
cannot exceed 20mV/V differential. Otherwise the input to the ADC will be saturated.
Note for External Temperature Sensors: The PreAmp_Gain is usually set to 3 or 5, which always guarantees the
specified resolution.
Note: As a single ended input, the temperature input signal must fit in the voltage range 1V to (VDD/2-1.2V).
“Negative” Checkbox
To select negative bridge gain polarity, click on the “Negative” checkbox.
“LongInt” Checkbox
To select the longer conversion time for low noise, click on the “LongInt” checkbox. (For more details see the
ZSC31014 RbiciLite™ Data Sheet.)
“Bsink” Checkbox
To enable the Bsink power-saving option, click on the “Bsink” checkbox.
“Gain8X” Checkbox
If “Gain8X_B” is checked, the Gain_B is multiplied by a factor of 8. The check box is set by the calibration DLL as
result of the calculated calibration coefficients stored in the EEPROM.
4.11. “Calibration” Button
To initiate a calibration run, click the “Calibration” button. This results in the calibration screen and dialog box
shown in Figure 4.4. See section 5 for a full description of calibration and settings used on the “Calibration”
window.

5 Calibration
5.1. Calibration Sequence
Although the ZSC31014 can function with many different types of resistive bridges, assume it is connected to a
pressure bridge for the following calibration example. In this case, calibration essentially involves collecting raw
bridge and temperature data from the ZSC31014 for different known pressures and temperatures. This raw data
can then be processed by the calibration master (the PC), and the calculated coefficients can then be written to
the EEPROM of the ZSC31014.
The software IDT provides with the SSC Evaluation Kit is intended for demonstration purposes and calibration of
single units. IDT can provide customers with algorithms and assistance in developing their full production
calibration software. For the following steps, refer to the calibration window shown in Figure 4.4.

There are three main steps to calibration:
    1. Assigning a unique identification to the ZSC31014. This identification is programmed in EEPROM
        Cust_ID0 and Cust_ID1 registers and can be used as an index in the database stored on the calibration
        PC. This database will contain all the raw values of bridge readings and temperature readings for that
        part, as well as the known pressure and temperature to which the bridge was exposed.
    2. Collecting data. Data collection involves getting raw data from the bridge at different known pressures
        and temperatures. This data is then stored on the calibration PC using the unique identification of the
        ZSC31014 as the index into the database.
    3. Calculating and writing coefficients to EEPROM. After enough data points have been collected to
        calculate all the desired coefficients, the coefficients can be calculated by the calibrating PC and written
        to the EEPROM of the ZSC31014.

                                                                                     ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
Step 1 – Assigning a Unique Identification (ASIC ID Section)
In the top middle of the calibration screen (see Figure 4.4), click on “Initialize.” In the resulting dialog box (see
Figure 5.1), verify or correct the configuration for the ZSC31014 under test and then click OK to initialize the part.
The part is assigned a unique ID, which is used as an index in the database. This unique ID is also programmed
into the EEPROM Cust_ID0 and Cust_ID1 registers. The software automatically loads and writes unity values for
Gain_B and Gain_T to the EEPROM and sets the Offset_B to an A2D_Offset related value. All other coefficients
are set to zero. The raw data are collected with these settings in NOM.
Note: The default values shown in this dialog window are the previous settings and can differ from the actual
EEPROM contents, which will be overwritten by clicking the OK button.
Step 2 – Data Collection
“Common Calibration Type” Menu
Next, select the type of calibration required from the “Common Calibration Type” pull-down menu in the top right
of the calibration screen (see Figure 5.1). The number of unique points (for this example, pressure and tempera-
ture points) at which calibration must be performed depends on the user’s requirements. The minimum is a
2-point calibration, and the maximum is a 7-point calibration.
Depending on the number of calibration temperature points, a linear or second order temperature correction is
performed with 2 or 3 (respectively) temperature coefficients (Offset_T&Gain_T or Offset_T&Gain_T&SOT_T).
In the left section of the calibration screen (see Figure 4.4), there is a graph (X-axis = Temperature, Y-axis =
Bridge). This graph outlines the recommended spread of points (pressure for this example and temperature) to be
used for calibration.
Based on statistical sensor measurements, a customer can decide to reduce the calibration costs by setting user-
selected default values for various calibration coefficients instead of using the calibration measurements. In this
case, enter the default values to be used for the selected calibration method in the coefficient entry fields at the
right of the calibration screen (see Figure 4.4). These fields will not be calculated by the chosen calibration
method. The calculation is disabled if there are entries for all defaults.
“Reset Defaults” Button
If needed, clicking the “Reset Defaults” button sets the default coefficients to 00HEX except Gain_B/Gain_T, which
are set to unity (2000HEX) and Offset_B, which is set to a value related to the ADC offset (A2D_Offset setting).
See Table 5.1.

“Bridge (%)” and “Temperature (°C)” Fields
Place the bridge/ZSC31014 pair to be calibrated in a controlled environment (for this example, a pressure and
temperature chamber), and stabilize the environment at the first desired calibration point.
→ Enter the target bridge readout in % (in this case, pressure) in the “Bridge (%)” field under “Actual.”
     (See Figure 5.1.)
→ Enter the target temperature in °C in the “Temperature (°C)” field under “Actual.”
→ Click on “Add New Point.” The raw data (pressure and temperature) are obtained from the part, and the
    point is displayed on the large graph. The point is graphed as the values entered in the previous two steps: the
    X-axis is the target temperature reading and the Y-axis is the target % value.
→ Change the pressure/temperature of the bridge/ZSC31014 pair being calibrated and repeat. Take as
    many more points as needed.
Hints:
For good calibration results, choose the temperature and bridge readout (%) values as close as possible to the
desired working range.
Step 3 – Calculating and Writing the Coefficients
“Calculate & Write Coefficients” Button
After enough data points have been collected to calculate the calibration coefficients, click the “Calculate & Write
Coefficients” button. The software calculates all the coefficients, writes them to EEPROM, and frees up that index
for future use. The bridge/IC pair is now calibrated. Before the software starts to calculate and write the
coefficients, all raw readings are stored in the caldata.txt file (see section 4.1.2).

                                                                                      ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
5.2. Dry Run Calibration
The following steps demonstrate a simple 2-point linear calibration using the artificial bridge on the Evaluation
Board. Important: The jumpers must be connected on K6 (VBP) and K7 (VNP).
Steps for a Dry Run Calibration using the Artificial Bridge on the Evaluation Board:
    1. Connect the SSC Communication (SSC CB) and the SSC ZSC31014 Evaluation Board. Insert the
        ZSC31014 in the SOP-8 socket on the SSC Evaluation Board. The correct orientation for pin 1 is shown
        in Figure 2.1.
    2. Connect a USB cable from the USB connector on the SSC CB to an available USB port on the PC. Verify
        that the green PWR LED is lit on the SSC CB.
    3. Start the ZSC31014 iLiteTester™ software.
    4. Click “Find Port” to find the proper COM port.
    5. Click on “START CM.” If the setup is correct, the buttons in the lower part of the main window will be
        activated.
    6. Click on “Calibration.” The calibration window appears (Figure 4.4).
    7. In the upper right section of the calibration window, under the “Common Calibration Types” drop-down
        menu, choose “2-Pt Gain_B, Offset_B” calibration. The graph indicates the recommended pattern of two
        bridge readings at the same temperature.
    8. Click on the “Initialize” button, and click “OK” to keep the default settings for the dialog box (Figure 5.2). A
        unique identifier is assigned to the ZSC31014 and is written to its EEPROM.

                                                                     Internal diode settings
                                                                     except “LongInt” should
                                                                     not be changed by the
                                                                     software (see data sheet
                                                                     for more details)

                                                                                      ZSC31014 Evaluation Kit Description
    9. The next step is to start data collection. Normally this would be done with a real bridge attached to the
        ZSC31014 on a remote board in a controlled chamber. Instead, this dry run calibration uses the artificial
        bridge inputs controlled by the on-board DAC. The DAC is controlled by the “Artificial Stimulus” slider bar
        or its adjacent entry field at the top of the calibration window (see Figure 4.4).
        a. Set the DAC control to 300HEX.
        b. Enter 10 in the “Bridge (%)” field under “Actual.”
        c.   Click on “Add New Point.” The software obtains a raw reading from the part and graphs the new data
             point.
        d. Change the DAC setting to D00HEX.
        e. Enter 90 in the “Bridge (%)” field under “Actual.”
        f.   Click on “Add New Point” again. The software obtains a new raw reading from the part and graphs
             the new data point.
    10. Because this is a 2-point calibration, the software has all the necessary data for calculating and writing
        the coefficients. Click on “Calculate & Write Coefficients,” which should now be active.
    11. Close the calibration window. The temperature reading is not valid because not enough data points were
        collected for temperature calibration.
    12. Start the Normal Operation Mode (NOM) by clicking on “START NOM” and read the measurement results
        continuously (click Run Continuous).The DAC is now controlled by the “Artificial” slider below the data
        read-outs and its adjacent entry field. Adjust the DAC, and check that the displayed values make sense.
        For example, 800HEX should read 50% and A80HEX should read 70%.
Steps for a Dry Run Calibration using the Sensor Replacement Board:
The following steps demonstrate a simple 2-point linear calibration using the artificial bridge on the Sensor
Replacement Board (SRB).
Important: The jumpers must be removed from connectors K6 (VBP) and K7 (VNP).
    1. Connect the SSC Communication (SSC CB), the SSC ZSC31014 Evaluation Board and SSC SRB. Insert
        the ZSC31014 in the SOP-8 socket on the SSC Evaluation Board. The correct orientation for pin 1 is
        shown in Figure 2.1.
    2. Connect a USB cable from the USB connector on the SSC CB to an available USB port on the PC. Verify
        that the green PWR LED is lit on the SSC CB.
    3. Start the iLiteTester™ software.
    4. Click “Find Port” to find the proper COM port.
    5. Click on “START CM.” If the setup is correct, the buttons in the lower part of the main window will be
        activated.
    6. Click on “Calibration.” The calibration window appears (Figure 4.4).
    7. In the upper right section of the calibration window, under the “Common Calibration Types” drop-down
        menu, choose “2-Pt Gain_B, Offset_B” calibration. The graph indicates the recommended pattern of two
        bridge readings at the same temperature.

                                                                                      software (see data sheet
                                                                                      for more details)
    9. The next step is to start data collection. Normally this would be done with a real bridge attached to the
        ZSC31014 on a remote board in a controlled chamber. Instead, this dry run calibration uses the Sensor
        Replacement Board (SRB) as bridge inputs.
        a. Turn the red potentiometer on the SRB all the way to the left.
        b. Enter 10% in the “Bridge (%)” field under “Actual.”
        c.   Click on “Add New Point.” The software obtains a raw reading from the part and graphs the new data
             point.
        d. Turn the red potentiometer on the SRB all the way to the right.
        e. Enter 90% in the “Bridge (%)” field under “Actual.”
        f.   Click on “Add New Point” again. The software obtains a new raw reading from the part and graphs
             the new data point.
    10. Because this is a 2-point calibration, the software has all the necessary data for calculating and writing
        the coefficients. Click on “Calculate & Write Coefficients,” which should now be active.
    11. Close the calibration window. The temperature reading is not valid because not enough data points were
        collected for temperature calibration.
    12. Start the Normal Operation Mode (NOM) by clicking on “START NOM” and read the measurement results
        continuously (click Run Continuous) to verify the output change according to the potentiometer position.

Steps for the Off-line Calibration Coefficient Calculation:
(1) Start the ZSC31014 cLite™ Software.
(2) Click on “Calibrate.” The calibration window appears (see Figure 6.1).
(3) Select the coefficients for the desired calibration method by highlighting the coefficients in the upper middle
     section of the calibration window. The smaller graph above the coefficient list indicates the recommended
     pattern of capacitive sensor readings and temperature readings.
(4) Click on “Initialize” in the “Initialization” section (upper left corner). The “Initialize Calibration” window appears
     (see Figure 5.2). Click “Browse” and select any xxx.eep file stored in the folder C:\Documents And
     Settings\[Current User]\My Documents\ZMDI\ZSC31014. Click on “Initialize From File.”
     Note: This is a “blind” initialization, because no part is connected.
(5) Start data collection. Fill in numbers in the column “Point”. The target and raw values can be written/copied in
     the related fields. The numbers are [%] for the bridge target and raw readings and [°C] for the temperature
     target and raw readings.
           a. Click on “Add New Point.”
           b. Enter the first target bridge reading [%] in the “sensor” field and enter the raw value [%] in the “raw”
               field. For calibration with temperature compensation, also add the chamber temperature in the “temp”
               field temperature and raw readings in the “rawT” fields.
           c.  Repeat a) and b) as needed until all calibration points are entered.
(6) Check the “Valid” check box, and click on the “Calculate Coefficients“button. The coefficients are stored in the
     CalibrationLog.txt file.
(7) Click “View Log” to open this file. For each calibration point, the error for the point is calculated in the same
     file.
Note Instead of entering the raw and target values for the bridge and temperature target and raw values, these
        values can be transferred from an Excel™ file using the copy/paste feature. First, add the correct number of
        calibration points ( correct table size). Make sure that the Excel™ table includes only numbers in the
        correct format (Category: Number). Copying from formula results is not possible.
The minimum number of points is determined by the selected calibration method. Additional points can be added.
If the points are selected (check box enabled), they will be part of the calibration; otherwise these points will be
used for error validation only.

7 ZSC31014 Software with the IDT SSC Terminal
7.1. Protocol
The microcontroller (type Atmega32) on the SSC Communication Board (SSC CB) enables communication with
                                                                                                                  2
the SSC Evaluation Board and the ZSC31014 using the evaluation software running on the PC. The standard l C
protocol is implemented in the microcontroller’s software. The USB_UART IC on the SSC CB transfers the signals
from the microcontroller to the USB port of the PC.
For more details, see SSC_CommunicationBoard_CommandSyntax_Rev_X_x.xls.
7.2. IDT SSC Terminal
The IDT SSC Terminal is the lowest level of communication for transferring commands from the PC to the
microcontroller on the SSC CB. A fully summary and detailed command description of the applicable controller
commands are given in SSC_CommunicationBoard_CommandSyntax_Rev_X_x.xls.
Install the SSC Terminal V201.exe from the SSC CD-ROM, which will create a IDT SSC Terminal icon on the PC
desktop. Click on this icon to active the terminal program. For the ZSC31014 communication mode, use the
                        2
setting explained for I C (bi-directional) or SPI (only reading).

In Command Mode, the master uses the I C protocol to send 4-byte commands to the Rbiciite™. This 32-bit I C
                                                  2
packet command/data stream consists of a I C WRITE command byte, which is the 7-bit slave address followed
                                   2
by the write bit 0 (e.g., 50HEX = I C WRITE command byte for the default slave address 28HEX and write bit 0); then
a command byte; and then16 data bits. See the ZSC31014_iLite_Data_Sheet document for a detailed illustration
of the WRITE command packet. Table 8.1 gives the format and valid range for the three bytes that follow the
         2
initial I C WRITE command byte.
Note: Only the commands listed in Table 8.1 are valid for the ZSC31014 in Command Mode. Other encodings
might cause unpredictable results. If data is not needed for the command, zeros must be supplied as data to
complete the 32-bit packet.

                                               sent and executed, a data fetch of three bytes must be performed. The first
                                               byte will be a response byte, which should be a 5AHEX, and then the next two
                                               bytes will be the EEPROM data.

                                               Mode. When a Start_NOM command is executed, a flag is checked to see if
                                               EEPROM was programmed during Command Mode. If so, the device will
                                               regenerate the checksum and update the signature EEPROM word.
