Brief Description                                          Benefits
IDT’s ZSSC416x/ZSSC417x is a family of CMOS                   SENT output option based on SAE J2716 Rev 3.0
integrated circuits for highly accurate amplification          standard using fast and SDM data channels
and sensor-specific correction of differential bridge         Supports output of one or more sensor signals
sensor signals. Featuring a maximum analog pre-                and product identification via a single SENT
amplification in the range of 150 to 200, this product         interface connection
is adjustable to nearly all resistive bridges as well as      Configurable for nearly all resistive bridge sensors
voltage source sensor types; e.g., thermocouples.
                                                              One-pass end-of-line calibration algorithm
Digital compensation of offset, sensitivity, temper-           minimizes production costs
