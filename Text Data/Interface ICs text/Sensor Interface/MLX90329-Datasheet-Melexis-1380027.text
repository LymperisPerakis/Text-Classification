MLX90329
Automotive Sensor Interfaces
5. General Description
The MLX90329 covers the most typical resistive type of Wheatstone bridge applications for use in an automotive
environment. It is a mixed signal sensor interface IC that converts small changes in resistors, configured in a full
Wheatstone bridge on a sensing element, to large output voltage variations.
The signal conditioning includes gain adjustment, offset control as well as temperature compensation in order to
accommodate variations of the different resistive sensing elements. Compensation values are stored in EEPROM
and can be reprogrammed with a Melexis tool including the necessary software. The MLX90329 is programmed
with a single wire serial interface through the output pin.
The user can specify SENT fast channel configuration, slow channel messages and enable several diagnostic
settings. By intercepting these various fault modes, the MLX90329 is able to inform about the reliability of its
output signal.

10. Filters
There are two filters available to filter the pressure signal. The first filter is a Small Signal Filter which can be
disabled or enabled. The second filter is a first order low pass filter for the pressure signal which has a
programmable depth.
An overview of the noise levels using different filter and gain combinations can be found in Table 6.
10.1. PFLT
PFLT is a programmable first order low pass filter. The depth of this filter can be selected. This filter can be
configured to select the optimal trade-off between response time and output noise.
3
  A maximum performance can be obtained with this sensor sensitivity range. A programmable gain with 5 bits from a gain of 9 to 237 is used in the
analog front end circuitry to adapt the sensor range to the on chip ADC input range. Half of the ADC input range (= 1.75V) is foreseen to be used
during the sensor calibration at the first temperature. The rest of the ADC input range is left for the compensation of the s ensor temperature
effects. A coarse offset compensation is available to calibrate large sensor offsets.
A more detailed overview of the gains in the analog frontend can be found in Table 7.

The low pass filter is implemented according to the following formula:
                                                          ( )                (   )
                                       ( )                                                       ( )
The PFLT parameter in the formula is set in EEPROM and can have a value between 0 and 9. An overview of
typical response times when applying a step on the input using different PFLT filter settings can be found in Table
5. The number of SENT frames indicated in the table includes the last frame which contains stable pressure data.
Filter setting 0 disables the PFLT.

10.2. SSF
The SSF (Small Signal Filter) is a digital filter which is designed not to have an impact on the response time of a
fast changing pressure signal like a pressure step. When a large signal change at the input is present, the filter is
bypassed and not filtering the signal. For small signal changes, which are in most cases noise, the filter is used
and filtering the pressure signal.
The Small Signal Filter can be enabled or disabled in EEPROM. It is advised not to use the SSF in combination with
the PFLT enabled.

11. Analog Front End
The analog front end of the MLX90329 consists of a chopping stage and 3 amplification stages as can be seen in
Figure 2. There are also several input diagnostics integrated into this front end to be able to detect a broken InP
or InN connection or an input which is out of range. This diagnostic information is transferred to the
microcontroller to handle further action for example flagging a diagnostic message.
                                                                                G = 1.25 or 3.5

The first stage is an instrumentation amplifier of which the gain can be programmed using 3 bits to cover a gain
range between 4.5 and 10.6.
Transfer equation:
OUTP1 – OUTN1 = Gst1*(InP – InN) in phase 1
OUTP1 – OUTN1 = Gst1*(InN – InP) in phase 2
The second stage is a fully differential amplifier. The gain of the amplifier can be calibrated using 1 bit.
Transfer equation:
OUTP2 – OUTN2 = -Gst2*(OUTP1 – OUTN1) – Gst2*(CSOF1 – CSOF2) in phase 1
OUTP2 – OUTN2 = -Gst2*(OUTN1 – OUTP1) – Gst2*(CSOF2 – CSOF1) in phase 2
The CSOF1 and CSOF2 signals are generated by the coarse offset DAC with the following transfer functions:
                                    2 1  VDDA CO[6 : 0]

CO[6:0] fixes the DAC output. CO7 is used for the polarity.
The third stage is an integrator which is controlled using 2 bits to set a gain between 1.6 and 6.4
Transfer equation at the outputs of the amplifier:
OUTP3 – OUTN3 = -N*(C1/C2)*(OUTP2 – OUTN2)
OUTP3_common_mode and OUTN3_common_mode = VCM = VDDA/2
In this equation N represents the number of integration cycles which is a fixed value of N = 40.
C2 is a fixed feedback capacitor of approximately 5pF. C1 can have 3 different values: 0.2pF, 0.4pF or 0.8pF.
Transfer equation after the ADC:
Pressure_ADC = ((OUTN3 – OUTP3)*216/VDDA) + 32768

13. Digital
The digital is built around a 16-bit microcontroller. It contains besides the processor also ROM, RAM and EEPROM
and a set of user and system IO registers.
Temperature compensation of the pressure signal and pressure linearization is handled by the microcontroller.
For the pressure compensation there are EEPROM parameters allocated to be able to cover a large variety of
calibration approaches.
Both for gain and offset of the pressure signal, there is a separate temperature dependency programmable
ranging from a temperature independence to a first order, second order and finally a third order compensation.
This is reflected in EEPROM parameters for the offset (O0, O1, O2 and O3) and for the gain (G0, G1, G2 and G3). If
required, the linearity of the pressure signal can also be compensated without a temperature dependency or
with a first order temperature dependency through EEPROM parameters L0 and L1.
For the temperature compensation of the pressure signal both the internal on-chip PTAT temperature as the
temperature measured using the sensor bridge resistance can be used. The selection between both can be set in
EEPROM using the ‘Tpress_Select’ parameter. Tpress_Select = 0 corresponds to sensing element temperature
reference and Tpress_Select = 1 is on-chip PTAT temperature. When using the sensing element bridge resistance

Linearization of the NTC temperature is also covered partially by the microcontroller. More information in this
topic can be found in chapter 14.
14. NTC Temperature Linearization
The linearization of the NTC temperature signal is split up in several stages. A schematic overview of these steps
can be seen in Figure 4.

The complete system can be divided into 5 separate stages.
       1. A resistor divider with internal resistor Rs is used to linearize Rntc into a voltage.
       2. A fully differential amplifier with unity gain is used to drive the ADC.
       3. The 16-bit ADC is being used to convert the analog resistor divider output voltage into a digital signal
            called ADC_raw.
       4. With the help of calibration data saved in EEPROM the microcontroller will perform a first compensation
            on ADC_raw converting in to ADC_comp. This new value is targeted to be as close as possible to the value
            ADC_ROM.
       5. Finally a look up table (LUT) will be used to convert the ADC_ROM values into the Tntc value which is the
            desired linearized NTC temperature.

  It is not mandatory to have a bridge resistance identical to the resistance selection setting. In this case it is advised to select the setting closest to
the actual value. In case support is needed please contact Melexis.

The default NTC characteristic which is calibrated can be found in Table 10. When using an NTC which does not
match the coefficients described above, it is advised to contact Melexis.
The EEPROM coefficients which are used for the conversion from ADC_raw to ADC_comp are N0 to N3,
N0_Diff_Low to N3_Diff_Low, N0_Diff_High to N3_Diff_High and TEMP1 to TEMP3.

15. SENT Configuration
The SENT output is designed to be compliant with the SAE J2716 rev. Apr 2016 SENT standard. The tick time is
configurable in EEPROM using parameter TICK_DIV. The available tick time settings are 3us, 4us, 6us, 10us, 12us
and 16us. A pause pulse can also be enabled to have a fixed frame length of 282 ticks. This can be done using
parameter PAUSE.
15.1. Fast Channel Configuration
On the fast channel, 8 different options are available to configure channel 1 and channel 2. An overview of these
different options and how to configure them can be found in Table 12.

                                              Table 12: Fast channel configuration options
The selection of the fast channel output mode can be done by changing the parameter ‘FC_CFG’ in the EEPROM.
In case Medium temperature is selected to be available on fast channel 2, the type of media should be defined in
EEPROM using parameter ‘Tmedium_Select’. When selecting 0, linearized NTC temperature will be available.
Selecting 1 enables sensing element temperature. Sensing element temperature needs to be calibrated after
connecting the sensing element to the MLX90329 and is not calibrated by Melexis(7).
For Internal temperature, also two options are available defined in EEPROM parameter ‘Tinternal_Select’ where
0 corresponds to on chip factory calibrated PTAT temperature and 1 corresponds to sensing element
temperature. The same comment regarding the calibration of the sensing element temperature calibration as
made above applies here.

15.2. Slow Channel Configuration
The Slow Serial Channel is implemented according to the Enhanced Serial Message Format using 12 bit data and 8
bit message ID as described in the reference SENT protocol standard SAE J2716 rev. Apr 2016.
An overview of the different slow channel messages which are available in the MLX90329 can be found in Table
13. From this table 16 messages can be configured completely in EEPROM. The 12 bit data content of these
messages can be configured freely. The ID of programmable message PR0, PR1, PR2 and PR3 is copied from
EEPROM (2x 4 bit). The ID of PR5 is 1 bit higher than of PR4. The same is valid for the other pairs: PR6-7, PR8-9, …,
PR14-15. This programmable ID is indicated in Table 13 as 0xYZ.
All programmable messages can also be enabled and disabled, but not all independently of each other:
      PR0, PR1, PR2 and PR3 can be each independently enabled or disabled
      PR4 and PR5 are together enabled or disabled
      PR6 and PR7 are together enabled or disabled
      PR8, PR9, PR10 and PR11 are together enabled or disabled
      PR12, PR13, PR14 and PR15 are together enabled or disabled

The repeatable messages MID01h, MID10h and MID23h can be configured individually to have their own
repetition rate. The repetition factor setting can be done in respectively “SENT_REP_FACT_ID_01”,
“SENT_REP_FACT_ID_10” and “SENT_REP_FACT_ID_23”.

Once a message is configured to be repeatable, it will automatically have the highest priority. Therefore it will
appear first in the slow message sequences.
The priority order between MID01, MID10 and MID23 can also be configured using EEPROM parameter
“SC_R_O”:
                   SC_R_O = 0: Priority order: ID01h > ID10h > ID23h
                      SC_R_O = 1: Priority order: ID10h > ID23h > ID01h

17.2. Diagnostic Sources
The MLX90329 product has several internal checks which monitor the status of device. These checks or
diagnostic sources can be enabled or disabled based on the sensor module requirements. An overview of the
different diagnostic sources, their enable/disable parameter and the explanation of their functionality can
be found below in table Table 17.

17.3. Fast and Slow Channel Diagnostics
There are two values reserved to show an error diagnostic mode in the fast channel. These values are 4090 and
4091. According to the type of diagnostic flag, one of the values will be transmitted if enabled. Internal errors like
for example PRESS_BROKEN_W or PRESS_PAR use 4090 to indicate an error condition on the fast channel.
Errors conditions which can be linked to external influences can be configured to either transmit 4090 or 4091.
These errors are VSUP_HIGH, VSUP_LOW and T_CHIP.
For both VSUP_HIGH and VSUP_LOW fast channel overwriting using an error message can even be disabled. This
allows you to still decode properly the pressure or optionally temperature information in case of an over voltage
or under voltage condition. The OV or UV condition can still be monitored using the status bits for FC1 and FC2
and the slow channel diagnostic message MID01.
An overview of the fast channel error configuration can be found in Table 18. The EEPROM parameters V_ERR,
FCE_VSUP and FCE_TCHIP handle this configuration.

The diagnostic slow channel message (MID 1) can be enabled or disabled independent of the other slow channel
messages and it has an adjustable repetition factor (2, 4, .., 30).

Automotive Sensor Interfaces
19. Unique features
Thanks to its state of the art mixed signal chain, the MLX90329 offers the possibility to calibrate several types of
resistive Wheatstone bridge technologies allowing the MLX90329 users to reach an outstanding overall sensor
accuracy. The MLX90329 is robust for harsh automotive environments like large temperature range, overvoltage
conditions and external EMC disturbances.
The MLX90329 allows the compensation of sensor nonlinear variations over temperature as well as compensates
for the sensor pressure signal non linearity. Several parameters can be programmed through the application pins
in the MLX90329 to set clamping levels or filter settings to choose for the best trade-off between signal chain
noise and speed. The MLX90329 can also diagnose several error conditions like sensor connections errors.
The sensor bias Vbrg which is supplying the external pressure sensor is generated using a regulator. The target
sensor supply is 6/7VDDA or typically 3V. The current through the bridge resistance is mirrored and divided so
that it can be fed to an IV convertor. This IV converted signal is a measure for the external temperature so that it
can be used for the calibration of the pressure sensor.
MLX90329 can interface an external NTC and provide the linearized temperature information together with the
pressure signal on the SENT output. This NTC is factory calibrated by Melexis.

20. Application Information
The MLX90329 only needs 2 capacitors in the application. A 100nF decoupling capacitor connected between the
supply line and the ground a 2.2nF load between the SENT output pin and the ground.
Optionally an NTC can be connected to pin 7. It is recommended to place a 10nF capacitor in parallel with the
NTC to improve EMC performance. In case no NTC is used, pin 7 has to be connected to GND.
MLX90329 has built in EMC protection for the sensor supply and sensing element input pins. Therefore it is
advised not to place any external capacitors between the sensing element and the interface. Capacitors on the
sensor supply or the inputs can even disturb the normal operation of the interface.
These recommendations for external components are however only providing a basic protection. Depending on
the module design and the EMC requirements different configurations can be needed.
