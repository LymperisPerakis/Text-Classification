© ABLIC Inc., 2012-2016                                                                                            Rev.1.3_02
The S-5470 Series, developed by CMOS technology, is a normally-off faint signal detection IC with an ultra-low current
consumption.
This IC has a function to detect certain current level of 0.7 nA typ., which makes it possible to detect faint signals for a
variety of electric generating devices or sensor devices. It also has a function to detect the difference of current level, and
thus detects difference between strengths of two signals input at the same time.
Due to its ultra-low current consumption and low-voltage operation, the S-5470 Series is suitable for battery-operated
small mobile device applications.

   ULTRA-LOW CURRENT CONSUMPTION NORMALLY-OFF FAINT SIGNAL DETECTION IC
 Rev.1.3_02                                                                                               S-5470 Series
 Operation
     The S-5470 Series detects either certain current level or the difference of current level.
     The operation of the S-5470 Series is described below, using CMOS output and active "H" products as examples.
  1.   Basic operation when detecting certain current level (INM pin = VSS)
     The S-5470 Series operates as follows when the INM pin is connected to VSS pin.
       (1) If IINP is lower than IDET, an "L" level signal is output from the OUT pin.
       (2) If IINP increases and becomes equal to or higher than IDET, an "H" level signal is output from the OUT pin (point
           A in Figure 14). Even if IINP decreases and falls below IDET, as long as IINP is higher than IREL, an "H" level
           signal is output from the OUT pin.
       (3) If IINP then decreases further and becomes equal to or lower than IREL, an "L" level signal is output from the
           OUT pin (point B in Figure 14).
       Remark        IINP: Current input to the INP pin
                     IDET: Detection current (refer to "4. 1 Detection current (IDET)")
                     IREL: Release current (refer to "4. 2 Release current (IREL)")
     Caution 1.        There are internal diodes at the INP pin and the INM pin. Therefore, in order to input a current
                       to the INP pin and the INM pin, an input voltage of at least the forward voltage of these diodes
                       is required.
                2. Feed-through current (IPEAK = 100 nA) flows around the time when the OUT pin voltage switches,
                       as shown in Figure 14. Therefore, if the input current is fixed around this time, the current
                       consumption will increase.

   2.  Basic operation when detecting the difference of current level
       (Current amplifier current amplification ratio  GINM)
      The S-5470 Series operates as follows when current (IINM) is applied to the INM pin.
        (1) If IINP is lower than IDET  GINM  IINM, an "L" level signal is output from the OUT pin.
        (2) If IINP increases and becomes equal to or higher than IDET  GINM  IINM, an "H" level signal is output from the
            OUT pin (point A in Figure 16). Even if IINP decreases and falls below IDET  GINM  IINM, as long as IINP is
            higher than IREL  GINM  IINM, an "H" level signal is output from the OUT pin.
        (3) If IINP then decreases further and becomes equal to or lower than IREL  GINM  IINM, an "L" level signal is output
            from the OUT pin (point B in Figure 16).
        Remark       IINP:  Current input to the INP pin
                     IINM:  Current input to the INM pin
                     IDET:  Detection current (refer to "4. 1 Detection current (IDET)")
                     IREL:  Release current (refer to "4. 2 Release current (IREL)")
      Caution 1.       There are internal diodes at the INP pin and the INM pin. Therefore, in order to input a current
                       to the INP pin and the INM pin, an input voltage of at least the forward voltage of these diodes
                       is required.
                 2. Feed-through current (IPEAK = 100 nA) flows around the time when the OUT pin voltage switches,
                       as shown in Figure 16. Therefore, if the input current is fixed around this time, the current
                       consumption will increase.

           The detection current (IDET) is the current at which the output switches to "H".
           The detection current varies slightly even among products with the same specification. The variation in detection
           current from the minimum detection current (IDET min.) to the maximum detection current (IDET max.) is called the
           detection current range (refer to Figure 18).

      4. 2   Release current (IREL)
           The release current (IREL) is the current at which the output switches to "L".
           The release current varies slightly even among products with the same specification. The variation in release
           current from the minimum release current (IREL min.) to the maximum release current (IREL max.) is called the
           release current range (refer to Figure 19).
           The range is calculated from the actual detection current (IDET) of a product and is in the range of IDET  0.7 
           IREL  IDET  0.9.

      4. 3   Hysteresis width
           The hysteresis width is the current difference between the detection current and the release current (current at
           point B  current at point A in "Figure 14 Operation when Detecting Certain Current Level" and "Figure 16
           Operation when Detecting the Difference of Current Level").
           The hysteresis width between the detection current and the release current prevents malfunction caused by
           noise in the input current.

 Precautions
    Use the S-5470 Series with the output current of 20 mA or less.
    The S-5470 Series may malfunction if the power supply voltage changes suddenly.
    As for the detecting circuit of the photocurrent difference (Refer to "Figure 22, Figure 23 Example Photocurrent
     Level Difference Detector"), use the S-5470 Series when input current of INP pin is 20 A or less and input
     current of INM pin is 10 A or less. In case of input current excess, note that the S-5470 Series might malfunction.
    The output in the S-5470 Series is unstable in lower voltage than the minimum operation voltage. At the time of
     power-on, use the S-5470 Series after output stabilization.
    Set a capacitor of 0.1 F or more between the VDD pin and VSS pin for stabilization.
    Since INP pin and INM pin is easy to be affected by disturbance noise, perform countermeasures such as
     mounting external parts to ICs as close as possible.
    If power impedance is high, the S-5470 Series may malfunction due to voltage drop caused by feed-through
     current. Set wire patterns carefully for lower power impedance.
    Do not apply an electrostatic discharge to this IC that exceeds the performance ratings of the built-in electrostatic
     protection circuit.
    ABLIC Inc. claims no responsibility for any disputes arising out of or in connection with any infringement by
     products including this IC of patents owned by a third party.
