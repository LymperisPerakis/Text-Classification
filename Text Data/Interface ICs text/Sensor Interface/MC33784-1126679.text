DSI 2.02 Sensor Interface
   The 33784 is a slave, Distributed System Interface Bus (DBUS),                                33784
version 2.02 compatible device, optimized as a sensor interface. The
device contains circuits to power sensors such as accelerometers,
and to digitize the analog level from the sensor. The device is
controlled by commands over the bus, and returns measured data                            SENSOR INTERFACE
and other information over the bus.

     1. ESD1 testing is performed in accordance with the Human Body Model (HBM) (CZAP = 100pF, RZAP = 1500Ω), ESD2 testing is
          performed in accordance with the Machine Model (MM) (CZAP = 200pF, RZAP = 0Ω); and Charge Body Model (CBM)
     2.   Pin soldering temperature limit is for 10 seconds maximum duration. Not designed for immersion soldering. Exceeding these limits may
          cause malfunction or permanent damage to the device.
     3.   Freescale’s Package Reflow capability meets Pb-free requirements for JEDEC standard J-STD-020C. For Peak Package Reflow
          Temperature and Moisture Sensitivity Levels (MSL), Go to www.freescale.com, search by part number [e.g. remove prefixes/suffixes
          and enter the core ID to view all orderable parts. (i.e. MC33xxxD enter 33xxx), and review parametrics.
