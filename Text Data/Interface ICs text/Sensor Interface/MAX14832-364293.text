Note 2: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Limits over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: When DIN1 or DIN2 is near the logic input threshold, the VCC supply current increases by a maximum of 275µA for each
        input.
Note 4: Supply voltage required at VCC to ensure reliable OTP.
Note 5: See the Voltage Transients section.
Note 6: ESD and surge protection for VCC is only guaranteed with an external 0.1µF capacitor connected between VCC and GND.
