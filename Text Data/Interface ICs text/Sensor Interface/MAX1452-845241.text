Note 1:  Excludes sensor or load current.
Note 2:  All electronics temperature errors are compensated together with sensors errors.
Note 3:  The sensor and the MAX1452 must be at the same temperature during calibration and use.
Note 4:  This is the maximum allowable sensor offset.
Note 5:  This is the sensor’s sensitivity normalized to its drive voltage, assuming a desired full span output of +4V and a bridge volt-
         age range of +1.7V to +4.25V.
Note 6: Bit weight is ratiometric to VDD.
Note 7: Programming of the EEPROM at room temperature is recommended.
Note 8: Allow a minimum of 6ms elapsed time before sending any command.
