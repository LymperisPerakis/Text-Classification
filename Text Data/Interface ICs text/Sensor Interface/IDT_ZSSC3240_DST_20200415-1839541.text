ZSSC3240
6.      Device Description
The ZSSC3240 can be set up to for one of three main operating modes:
Sleep Mode                        The Sleep Mode is recommended for smart sensors with purely digital output. The
                                  ZSSC3240 automatically enters the idle state after command execution for minimum
                                  current consumption, whereas the interface is still listening and accepts commands.
                                  After receiving a valid command, the ZSSC3240 wakes up, executes the command,
                                  provides the results at the digital interface, where the results must be read, and returns
                                  to idle state after the data fetch. The results are only available once; repeated data fetch
                                  is not supported. In Sleep Mode, sensor measurement results cannot be provided at the
                                  analog output of ZSSC3240.
Command Mode                      The Command Mode is most appropriate for evaluation, test, and calibration purposes.
                                  In this mode, all commands are available, both digital and analog outputs are supported
                                  and all functionality is available. Command Mode can be used for applications requiring
                                  re-occurring (or even continuous) digital interaction, potential analog output, and
                                  minimum latency. Applications in Command Mode are only active on command request.
Cyclic Mode                       In Cyclic Mode, autonomous, cyclically repeated sensor measurements are performed
                                  and related digital and/or analog output updates are provided. Cyclic Mode is
                                  recommended for analog output applications. The cyclic sequence for measurements,
                                  diagnostics, and hence the output update rate is configurable.
The ZSSC3240 always enters the programmed default_mode after power-on (reset). One of the three operating
modes can be set up as the default. After the ZSSC3240 is powered and has entered its default mode, changing
to one of the other operating modes is possible via the mode change and start commands: START_CM,
START_CYC, START_SLEEP (see section 6.6.1 for details).
                                                                  Power-On (VDD),

                                          Figure 3.    Main Operating Modes of the ZSSC3240
The ZSSC3240 supports three different types of digital interfaces: I2C, SPI, and OWI. All interface types allow
application and control of each of the main operating modes.
Exception: The combination of Sleep Mode as the default mode (see the default_mode bit in the SSF1 register in
Table 34) and the OWI interface is not supported. The OWI interface must be disabled (owi_off = 1, bit[13] in the
SSF1 register) for correct Sleep Mode operation.

ZSSC3240
When using commands to change the operating mode, e.g. START_CM or START_SLEEP, validation of the
new operating mode is recommended; e.g., by reading an NVM register or simply retrieving the status byte.
Note: The ZSSC3240 always requires two or more interface command interactions after an operating mode
change prior to any additional changes in the mode.
6.1       Signal Flow
See the figures on page 2 for the ZSSC3240 block diagram and circuit diagrams for different input sensors. The
ZSSC3240 supports two sensor supplies: ratiometric voltage and current mode, i.e., sensor current bias. In the
ratiometric sensor-supply configuration, VDDB and the power supply for analog circuitry are provided by an on-
chip voltage regulator, which is optimized for power supply disturbance rejection (PSRR). To improve noise
suppression, the digital blocks are powered by a separate voltage regulator. A power supervision circuit monitors
all supply voltages and generates appropriate reset signals for initializing the digital blocks.
The System Control Unit controls the analog circuitry to perform the measurement types: external sensor,
external or internal temperature, and offset measurement. The multiplexer selects the signal input to the
amplifier, which can be the external signals from the input pins INP, INN, TEXT, VDDB, and VSSB or the internal
temperature reference sensor signals. A full measurement request will trigger an automatic sequence of all
measurement types and all input signals. The basic sensor signal source configuration is set up in the SSF1
register (see Table 34) in the on-chip memory.
The programmable gain amplifier (PGA) consists of two stages with programmable gain values. The ZSSC3240
employs a programmable analog-to-digital converter (ADC) optimized for conversion speed and noise
suppression. The programmable resolution from 12 to 24 bits provides flexibility for adapting the conversion
characteristics. To improve power supply noise suppression, the ADC uses the external sensor supply voltage,
e.g., VDDB for the ratiometric supply of a connected full-bridge sensor element, as its reference voltage leading
to a ratiometric measurement topology. The remaining IC-internal offset and the sensor element offset, i.e., the
overall system offset for the amplifier and ADC, can be canceled via an offset and auto-zero measurement,
respectively.
The math core accomplishes the auto-zero, span, and 1st and 2nd order temperature compensation of the
measured external sensor signal. The correction coefficients are stored in the non-volatile memory.
The ZSSC3240 supports SPI, OWI, and I2C interface communication for controlling the ZSSC3240,
configuration, and measurement result output. Analog output signals can be provided, which are proportional to
the sensor signal that has been compensated for nonlinearity and temperature. The ZSSC3240 can also check
and signalize numerous sensor and self-check diagnostic values.
6.2       Analog (Sensor) Front-End
The main blocks and functions of the analog sensor front-end of the ZSSC3240 are illustrated in Figure 4. As a
typical first setup, the type and supply of the connected (external) sensor element should be determined and
configured. The sensor_sup and temp_source bits in the SSF1 register (03HEX; see Table 34) of the NVM must
be set up according to the connected sensor configuration.
Important: If using the current mode sensor biasing via the “Sensor Bias Current” block, which is configured with
the Tbiasout bit field (see section 6.2.4), ensure that the selection for bias current combined with the
dimensioning for the connected external sensor is within the input common mode constraints, VCMin (typical
0.85V) as defined in Table 4.

6.2.1.      Programmable-Gain Amplifier (PGA)
The amplifier has a fully differential architecture and consists of two stages. The amplification of each stage and
the external sensor gain polarity are programmable via settings in the measurement configuration register:
•   For the main sensor element: SM_config1 and SM_config2 (NVM addresses 14HEX and 15HEX; see Table 34)
•   For an optional external temperature sensor: extTemp_config1 and extTemp_config2 (NVM addresses 16HEX
    and 17HEX; see Table 34).
The first 7 bits of the *_config1 registers are the programmable gain settings Gain_stage1 and Gain_stage2. The
options for the programmable gain settings are listed in Table 5 and Table 6. The resulting analog gain is the
linear product of the stage 1 and stage 2 selection: GainPGA = Gain1 ⋅ Gain2. With the programmable
Gain_polarity bit in the *_config1 registers, the sign of the effective PGA gain can be swapped; e.g., to invert the
sensor characteristic’s slope and invert signal processing of the differential signal between INP and INN.

In addition to the amplification of the sensor input signals, the PGA’s first stage can perform an absolute offset
shifting of the differential sensor signal. This shift operation can be programmed in 1mV steps with the
configuration setup ioffsc bit field in the SM_config2 and extTemp_config2 registers. The effective voltage-shift
depends on the selected Gain1, Gain_stage1. The VIOFFSC values (in Table 8) correspond to the higher Gain1
values, i.e. Gain1 > 100. The PGA-operation including shift effect for a differential input signal, VDIFFin can be
described as:

The shifting can be configured independently for the main sensor and the optional, external temperature sensor.
If the absolute offset shifting is enabled, then the ZSSC3240 current consumption increases by 100µA. The
advantage of absolute offset shifting is an increase of analog dynamic range in the ZSSC3240’s sensor front-
end, which results in higher measurement result quality (less noise/fluctuations).

The PGA can perform an automatic adjustment for the PGA input to ADC input common mode. This can be
enabled via the pga_en_shift bit in the *_config2 registers. The supportable input common mode range at the
PGA, i.e. at the sensor front-end input, is constant per IC because it is derived from the internally regulated
voltage VDDAint.

  [a]  There is a general PGA-input range constraint to support VINdiff of ±700mV at maximum, which is especially dominating for GAMP < 2.
6.2.2.        Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to digitize the amplifier signal. To allow optimizing the trade-off
between conversion time and resolution, the resolution can be programmed from 12-bit to 24-bit (adc_bits bit
fields in the SM_config1, and extTemp_config1 registers; see section 6.6.2.1). The ADC processes differential
input signals around its input common mode level: VADCmid. Table 10 lists the ADC resolution, signal ranges,
conversion times for a single Analog-to-Digital conversion.

[b]   With the following settings: absolute reference, sel_ref* = 0, and no ADC-shift (adc_en_shift = 0) nor extra ADC-gain, i.e. GainADC=1
The ADC can perform an additional offset shift (independent of the PGA shifting with ioffsc) in order to adapt
input signals with offsets to the ADC input range. The shift feature is enabled by setting adc_en_shift = 1 (bit[8]
in the SM_config2 or extTemp_config2 registers). As defined in Table 11, the respective analog offset shift can
be selected with bits [14:12], adc_offset in SM_config1 or extTemp_config1.
Note: Enabling the offset shift causes the ADC to perform an additional amplification of the ADC’s input signal by
factor 2. This must be considered for a correct analog sensor setup by means of the PGA’s gain, the absolute
offset shift in the PGA, the ADC offset shift, and the potential ADC gain.
The overall analog amplification GainTOTAL = GainPGA · GainADC can be determined for the following potential use
cases using Equation 2 or Equation 3 depending on the ADC offset setting:
  If no ADC offset shift is selected, i.e., adc_en_shift = 0 and adc_offset = 000, then
  GainTOTAL = GainPGA ⋅ 1                                                                                                    Equation 2
  If ADC offset shift is selected, i.e., adc_en_shift = 1 (adc_offset is configurable), then
  GainTOTAL = GainPGA ⋅ 2                                                                                                    Equation 3

ZSSC3240
6.2.3.       Internal Temperature Sensor
The ZSSC3240 provides an internal temperature sensor measurement to allow compensation for temperature
effects. The temperature output signal is a differential voltage that is adapted by the amplifier (PGA) for the ADC
input, comparable to the external sensor’s signal. For ZSSC3240-internal temperature measurements, the
respective settings are defined and programmed in the NVM by Renesas.
6.2.4.       Supported Supplies for Sensor Elements and Additional, External Temperature Sensing
There are two options to supply and bias the external sensor element, which can be selected by the sensor_sup
bit field in the SSF1 register (03HEX) in the NVM (see Table 34). The differential sensor signal (e.g., from a
sensor bridge) is fed into the ZSSC3240 at the INP pin for the positive and the INN pin for the negative signal
level.

There are multiple possible combinations of an external main sensing supply and the SSC-input signal
generation with different sensing elements and approaches for generating a temperature signal for temperature-
dependency compensation. Table 13 illustrates the possible sensor connections, application circuits, and
ZSSC3240 configurations.
Note: The applications circuits S1 to S3 and T1 to T5 highlight the supply paths in blue and the input signal paths
in red for the main sensing element connection and supply in Table 13 and for the supporting, external
temperature sensing in Table 15.

For a ratiometric sensor supply, the VDDAint voltage from the ZSSC3240-internal regulator is used. As defined in
Table 14, the alternative sensor bias current source generates a bias current that is programmable with the
Tbiasout in bit field in the *_config2 registers (see Table 34).

The ZSSC3240 supports internal and external temperature sensing for sensor-signal conditioning (SSC)
purposes; i.e. an extra, separate temperature measurement in order to compensate temperature effects in the
measurand signal from the main sensing element; e.g., a pressure sensor. The respective setup must be
configured via the temp_source bit field in the SSF1 register.
If the main sensing element itself with its inherent temperature sensitivity is used to generate the temperature
information for SSC correction, then the internal_rt and extra_rt bit fields in the SFF1 register must be
programmed. Table 15 provides an overview for the some of the supported temperature measurement options.
The internal resistors Rt and Rt’ have been designed for flat, almost zero-sensitivity to temperature, such that the
resulting temperature sensor measurements’ characteristic is mainly dominated only by the (typically spurious)
temperature characteristic of the main sensor element itself. The use of the bottom resistance Rt’, selectable by
extra_rt, is recommended for most related applications in order to have a bridge-resistance-related, symmetric
temperature excitation, and not to introduce further differential signal offset when using the bridge-sensor
element as the temperature sensor.
In any configuration, the constraints for the minimum /maximum absolute and differential input signal dynamics
must be considered.

When using scenario T1, “Bridge as the temperature sensor with the internal Rt in Current Mode” in Table 15,
the setup for bias current (Isup) and internal Rt must fulfill the requirements given in Equation 4 and Equation 5:
 (0.5 ⋅ Rsens + Rt) ⋅ Isup = 0.85V ±125mV                                                                               Equation 4
              Where Rsens is the nominal resistance of the sensor element; i.e. the typical, effective resistance
              generating the differential sensor signal as input to the INP and INN pads.
              Important: Take into consideration the maximum specifications for the PGA common mode input
              level, VCmin (see Table 4).
 (MAX[Rsens ] – MIN[Rsens]) ⋅ Isup < 700mV                                                                              Equation 5
              Important: Take into consideration the maximum specifications for the input signal, MAX[VDIFFin]
              (see Table 4).
The best method for deriving the respective values for Rt and Isup is to choose an Rt value close to but greater
than Rsens and to calculate Isup accordingly.
When using scenario T4, “Temperature sensor with internal Rt with ratiometric supply,” in Table 15 the setup for
bias current (Isup) and internal Rt must fulfill Equation 6:
               Important: Take into consideration the maximum specifications for the PGA common mode input
               level, VCmin, which is automatically ensured if Rt and the extra Rt’ are selected.

                Important: Take into consideration the maximum specifications for the input signal, MAX[VDIFFin]
                with VDDBtyp = 1.85V.
In most cases, a low Rt value will suffice for ratiometrically supplied configurations. The lower the applied Rt
value, the less the noise-level effect onto the temperature measurement signal.
Sensor-bridge elements, which already contain a top resistor for temperature sensing purposes, can use the
internal extra Rt’.
6.3        On-Chip Diagnostics
The ZSSC3240 offers analog and digital self-test and sensor-diagnostic features to ensure robust system
operation. If the part is programmed and operated with analog output (cont_ANAoutn = 0BIN in the SSF2 register;
see Table 34), then diagnostic states are indicated by upper and lower levels at the AOUT pin; see Table 16.
With the SPI, I2C, and OWI digital interfaces, the default status byte contains fault-diagnostics information. If
further detailed diagnostic information is required, the CHECK_DIAG command B0HEX must be issued to retrieve
the detailed diagnostics’ results in the diagnosticreg output register. The content of diagnosticreg (see Table 17)
is updated each time new respective diagnostic information becomes available. This is also the case with the
default ZSSC3240 initialization after power-on-reset (POR) or if specific commands are triggered in order to
perform diagnostic checks or influence diagnosticreg:
RESET_DIAG, B1HEX                 Resets the contents of diagnosticreg.
UPDATE_DIAG, B2HEX                Performs all enabled diagnostic checks (selected via the select_checks bit field
                                     [9:0] in register 21HEX in NVM; see Table 34) and default diagnostic checks
                                     including checksum validation of the NVM; results in complete update of
                                     diagnosticreg.
Connection Checks                 These are scheduled connection checks in the Cyclic Mode setup. All enabled
                                     checks (as selected with select_checks) are performed, and diagnosticreg is
                                     updated accordingly.
The analog signalization of diagnostic states at the AOUT pin for the different analog output options can be
enabled/disabled via the diagouten bit in the SSF2 register 04HEX in the NVM (see Table 34). In Cyclic Mode, the
analog signalization of a diagnostic state is present with the SSC Calculation and Output Update phase of the
same measurement slot; see section 6.5.2. In Command Mode (with enabled analog output at AOUT pin), the
diagnostic state at AOUT will be present with completion of the next SSC-conversion command, i.e. AAHEX or
ACHEX to AFHEX; see Table 33).

If multiple failures are detected leading to analog outputs that would be contradictory to each other, the high
signal is always provided. The effective absolute, analog diagnostic-output level is constant for lower and upper
diagnostic signal output. This absolute level may vary from IC to IC slightly. Hence, the effective lower and upper
level for the absolute AOUT signal in the event of a valid diagnostic and failure event, respectively, are not
influenced by any diagnostic-related setup in NVM nor by calibration coefficients, etc., per the Aout_setup bit
field in register 04HEX in NVM (see Table 34). However, the threshold (i.e., the sensor-signal-valid maximum for
the upper and minimum for the lower diagnostic band) can be programmed and adjusted via proper calibration
and the diagouten bit in register 04HEX.

  [a]   The effective low limit for the DAC and resulting AOUT output signaling scales with the set up DAC resolution and is 16-bit =

If a bit reset, i.e. a change from 1BIN (FAULT) back to 0BIN (NO-FAULT), for any bit occurs, diagnosticreg[0] is set
in order to signal an improvement of fault states during the ZSSC3240 operation. This is especially relevant for
Cyclic Mode and Continuous Analog-Output Mode operation.

ZSSC3240
The select_checks bit field in NVM register 21HEX 1 can be programed to select which (analog) checks are
executed and/or signalized when the UPDATE_DIAG command is triggered or when a connection check is
performed during Cyclic Mode operation. Checks that are not selected do not result in diagnosticreg register
updates and are not signalized at the DAC and AOUT output.
6.4        Digital Interfaces
The ZSSC3240 supports three different digital interface protocols: SPI, I2C, and OWI. The implementation of the
interfaces is such that the available commands (section 6.6.1) and request codes for the ZSSC3240 are the
same regardless on the interface type used.
The selection of whether the ZSSC3240 operates with SPI, I2C, or OWI interface is determined in the start-up
phase after power-on. Initially all interface relevant parameters are loaded from address 02HEX in the NVM (slave
address, SPI configuration). If the first command after power-on is a valid and properly formatted I2C request
including the correct slave address, the interface is fixed as an I2C slave. If, instead, there is an active signal at
the SS pin as the first valid activity, then the IC is fixed as an SPI slave. Alternatively, a valid OWI start (within
the start-up window) will fix the interface as OWI. Once, the interface is established and fixed, a change of the
interface can only be done by means of a power-on-reset. The status byte defined in Table 18 is common for all
supported interface types, and it is part of the ZSSC3240’s digital response to read requests.

6.4.1.       SPI
The SPI interface mode is available if the first interface activity after ZSSC3240 power-up is an active signal at
the SS pin. The polarity and phase of the SPI clock are programmable via the CKP_CKE setting in bits [11:10] in
address 02HEX as described in Table 34. CKP_CKE is two bits: CPHA (bit 10), which selects which edge of
SCLK latches data, and CPOL (bit 11), which indicates whether SCLK is high or low when it is idle. The polarity
of the SS signal and pin are programmable via the SS_polarity setting (bit 9).
The different combinations of polarity and phase are illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6. See Table 20 for the
timing parameters.

   Recommendation for current loop applications: To minimize the effect of varying current draw in current loop applications, do not perform
   short-connection checks (sens_short_check, text_inn_short_check, text_inp_short_check).

In SPI Mode, each command except NOP is started as shown in Figure 7. After the execution of a command
(busy = 0), the expected data can be read as illustrated in Figure 8 or if no data are returned by the command,
the next command can be sent. The status can be read at any time with the NOP command (see Figure 9).
Note: If SS and SCLK do not end after one complete read-response cycle, but continue for any reason, the
ZSSC3240 will start repeating; e.g. the measurement result data would repeat in the following sequence
(comparable to the OWI response shown in Figure 17):
Status → SensorData [23:16] → SensorData [15:8] → SensorData [7:0] → TempData[23:16] → TempData[15:8]
→ TempData[7:0] → SensorData [23:16] → SensorData [15:8] →...

I2C Mode is selected if the first interface activity after the ZSSC3240 power-up is an I2C command with valid
slave address. In I2C Mode, each command is started as shown in Figure 10. Only the number of bytes that are
needed for the command must be sent. An exception is the I2C High Speed Mode where 3 bytes must always
be sent as in SPI Mode. After the execution of a command (busy = 0), the expected data can be read as
illustrated in Figure 11 or if no data are returned by the command, the next command can be sent. The status
can be read at any time as described in Figure 12.

6.4.3.     One-Wire-Interface, OWI
The ZSSC3240 employs a one-wire digital interface concept (OWI). It combines a simple and easy protocol
adaptation with a cost-saving pin sharing. The communication principle of the OWI interface is derived from the
I2C protocol.

Both the analog output signal and the digital OWI interface use the same pin, AOUT. An advantage of the OWI is
that it enables “end of line” calibration – no additional pins are required to digitally calibrate a finished assembly.
Although the OWI is integrated mainly for calibration, it can also be used to read out the calibrated sensor signal
continuously or retrieve diagnostic detail information.
The OWI protocol is defined as follows:
• Idle State: During inactivity of the bus, the OWI line is pulled up to the supply voltage VDD by an external
  resistor.
• Start Condition: When the OWI line is in idle mode, a low pulse with a minimum width of tOWI,START ≥ 10μs and
  then a return to high indicates a start condition. Every request must be initiated by a start condition sent by a
  master. A master can generate a start condition only when the OWI line is in idle mode.
• Valid Data: Data is transmitted in bytes (8 bits) starting with the most significant bit (MSB). Transmitted bits
  are recognized after a start condition at every transition from low to high at the OWI line. The value of the
  transmitted bit depends on the duty ratio between the high phase and high/low period (bit period, tOWI,BIT in
  Figure 14). A duty ratio greater than 1/8 and less than 3/8 is detected as 0; a duty ratio greater than 5/8 and
  less than 7/8 is detected as 1. The bit period of consecutive bits must not increase to more than 1.5 times the
  previous bit period or decrease to less than half of the previous bit period because a stop condition is detected
  in this case.
The length of the OWI-line and the size of ROWI,PULL (if it is statically connected to AOUT), and consequently the
resistive and capacitive load influence the maximum possible interface speed and minimum Bit period,
respectively. Further, it can be beneficial for harsh EMC conditions to intentionally add capacitance to the OWI1
(AOUT) line in order to improve RF disturbance robustness. Table 22 shows some practical OWI-interface
dimensioning examples and the resulting maximum signal frequencies (minimum possible Bit periods). The
complete ZSSC3240’s OWI interface properties and timing capabilities are given in Table 23.

  [a]   To switch from analog output to “OWI listen” at AOUT pin.
  [b]   For the selection of ROWI,PULL, the minimum current limit of the AOUT buffer and maximal VDD supply must take into account if
        OWI and analog output voltage mode are set up to work concurrently; that is owi_off = 0, cont_ANAoutn = 0, and owi_su_case = 1.
        If the current limitation condition (IOUTmax, see Table 4) is exceeded, it is recommended to use the Dynamic Driving Approach for
        ROWI,PULL at the OWI-master, and only switch the ROWI,PULL to AOUT when the OWI-master starts communication. This setting is
        specifically recommended for the phases when the OWI-master listens to the AOUT-line, and the OWI-slave (the ZSSC3240) has
        to respond, respectively.
The effective OWI properties depend on the load conditions at the OWI1 pin. Additional to Table 22, some
further applicable configurations are as follows:
•  For maximum operation speed (50kHz) of OWI1, the capacitive load, COWI,LOAD can be up to 1nF and the
   maximum ROWI,PULL is 2.5kΩ.
•  For high operation speed (10kHz) of OWI1, the capacitive load, COWI,LOAD can be up to 4.7nF and ROWI,PULL
   must be ≤ 3.3kΩ.
•  For an equivalent frequency of 1kHz of OWI1, it should be ensured that COWI,LOAD ≤ 22nF and ROWI,PULL ≤ 7kΩ,
   or for example that COWI,LOAD ≤ 66nF combined with ROWI,PULL ≤ 4.5kΩ.

                                              Figure 17. OWI Response by ZSSC3240
The ZSSC3240 allows utilization of the OWI interface in different application configurations:
• OWI Disable: The OWI interface can be deactivated by owi_off = 1 (bit[13] in SSF1 register 03HEX). For
  example, this could be applied in cases when an analog-output smart sensor is configured and calibrated
  using the OWI interface and the OWI will not be available after calibration and final setup/programming.
• OWI Only (no analog output): With the NVM configuration owi_off = 0 and cont_ANAoutn = 1, the AOUT will
  not provide any analog outputs and is only used as the OWI pin. There is no startup window limitation
  (owi_su_length is ignored by the ZSSC3240). If the first (valid) digital interface activity is the Startup OWI
  (D2HEX) command, the ZSSC3240’s interface type will be fixed as OWI communication (SPI and I2C will be
  disabled/ignored).
• OWI with Startup Window and Analog Output: The OWI startup window followed by subsequent activation
  of the analog output is possible with owi_off = 0, cont_ANAoutn = 0, and owi_su_case = 0. AOUT works as a
  (listening) OWI signal pin after power-up until the selected startup window (owi_su_length) has elapsed. If the
  Startup OWI (D2HEX) command is received within the startup window, AOUT persists as the OWI
  communication pin until a power-on reset occurs. If the ZSSC3240 does not receive the
  Startup OWI command (D2HEX) during the startup window, the OWI interface will be disabled and AOUT starts
  functioning as an analog output.
• Continuous OWI and Analog Output: The configuration owi_off = 0, cont_ANAoutn = 0, and
  owi_su_case = 1 results in AOUT providing analog output levels as soon as they are available after power-up
  (in Cyclic Mode). Concurrently, the OWI listens to the AOUT 1 pin in order to check for valid OWI commands.
  The OWI still needs to be enabled by means of the Startup OWI command. The physical protocol in this
  configuration requires an extra pulse (see Figure 15) prior the Startup OWI command. After the release of the
  extra OWI initialization pulse, the analog output is switched off 2 and AOUT becomes the OWI I/O pin until the
  OWI startup window (according to owi_su_length) has elapsed.
  The OWI-master implements Dynamic Driving to avoid dynamic currents (due to DAC-output level changes)
  causing unwanted pull-up signal generation (via ROWI,PULL). When Dynamic Driving Approach is not applied in
  this configuration, set the constantly connected OWI-master pull-up resistances (ROWI,PULL) to ≥5.5kΩ to
  prevent erroneous OWI-start detections that can be triggered by changing DAC-output levels. Limit the
  interface speed to slower values with the proper setting, such as longer bit period.

  Dependent on Aout_setup, OWI2 is the alternative input pin, e.g., in the case of the current loop setup, i.e. the Aout_setup bit field = 000 in
  register 04HEX.
2
  The DAC switch-off time point is variable and depends on the activity status in the measurement cycle, measurement execution, etc. It can
  be anytime between the extra-pulse and a received, completed Startup OWI command.

ZSSC3240
6.5       Measurement and Output Options
Sensor or diagnostic measurement results of the ZSSC3240 can be provided in both domains, digital and
analog. Any of the supported digital interfaces and output options can be used as the only active interaction
path, or it can be combined with any of the analog output configurations. For digital communication, only one
interface type can be active and supported (see section 6.4).
Digital communication via SPI and I2C are fully independent of the configuration and application of the
ZSSC3240’s analog outputs. For digital OWI communication combined with analog output, special application
circuits and constraints might have to be considered, as the OWI interface and the analog outputs use the same
pin, AOUT.
6.5.1.      Single Measurements, Digital Raw Results, and SSC Results
The IC generates digital raw values, which are processed by the ZSSC3240-internal math core generating the
SSC-corrected (linearized, temperature-compensated) output signal. See section 6.6.3 for details about the SSC
math, etc. In addition to the SSC-corrected digital measurement results, the ZSSC3240 can provide raw values
without SSC correction for evaluation and/or calibration purposes. The respective results are provided at the
digital interface as a 24-bit wide data word. Raw values and SSC results are MSB-aligned. Raw values are
formatted as two’s-complement, whereas SSC results are formatted as unsigned absolute value.

The ZSSC3240 can process and digitize the following signals:
•  SM: Direct sensor signal inputs; i.e., perform sensor measurements
•  AZS: Auto-zero signals for the sensor channel
•  TM: Direct temperature signal inputs, i.e. perform temperature measurements
•  AZT: Auto-zero signals for the temperature channel
The internal sequence (in time) of A2D-conversions with both auto-zero measurements enabled is: first is AZS,
second is SM, third is AZT, and forth is TM. The utilization of auto-zero measurements allows further
optimization and reduction of the noise level for the sensor signal in combination with the inherent compensation
of the residual offsets of the analog sensor front-end. If an auto-zero measurement is enabled, then the sensor
signal remains the input for the auto-zero measurement with the gain and ADC set up as for the original signal
measurement, but with swapped inputs and offset configurations of the PGA and ADC such that the following
holds for the resulting raw value:
•  Sensor raw value with auto-zero: S_raw = 0.5 ⋅ (SM – AZS)
•  Temperature raw value with auto-zero: T_raw = 0.5 ⋅ (TM – AZT)
The application benefits with enabled auto-zero measurements are
•  ZSSC3240 front-end offset cancellation – residual signal degradation 1 or drift for the application is eliminated
•  Improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio for the raw or SSC-corrected output signal
1
  Worst-case IC-offset drift is < 2ppm/day at 125°C.

ZSSC3240
On the other hand, the default application benefit without auto-zero measurements is an approximately 50%
faster output update rate compared to an equivalent configuration with enabled auto-zero measurements.
Recommendations: For applications where a faster update rate is the priority, disable and not apply the auto-
zero measurements. For applications where a better signal-to-noise level and maximum signal quality are the
priority, enable and apply the auto-zero measurements.
The NVM configuration and measurement-request commands can be used to select which measurements are
performed, processed, and provided at the digital interface. See Table 33 for command details.
Examples of options for a single measurement request and output:
•  SSC-corrected sensor readings (requested by the Measure command AAHEX) generating an output of SSC-
   corrected, 24-bit sensor data followed by SSC-corrected, 24-bit temperature data.
•  Raw sensor measurement with or without auto-zero correction (requested by the Raw Sensor Measure
   command A2HEX) generating an output of raw 24-bit sensor data.
•  Raw temperature measurement with or without auto-zero correction (requested by the Raw Temperature
   Measure command, A4HEX) generating an output of raw 24-bit temperature data.
The auto-zero measurements can be disabled/enabled via the AZMs_on and AZMt_on bits in NVM registers
04HEX (see Table 34).
Table 26 and Table 27 provide some exemplary, typical conversion times and noise performance values for the
ZSSC3240’s Front-End (PGA and ADC) in order provide some guidance for understanding effects and signal-
quality-related consequences while defining an application setup.

6.5.2.                                     Cyclic, Continuous, Repeated Measurements – Measurement Scheduler
In addition to single measurement requests, such as AAHEX, or the Oversample-x Measure requests (ACHEX to
AFHEX; see Table 33), the ZSSC3240 can be configured for cyclic measurement sequences. The continuously
running measurement sequence consists of individual measurement slots in which all or a selectable subset of
measurements and checks can be scheduled and allocated including sensor measurement (S), auto-zero
measurement for the sensor (AZS), temperature measurement (T), auto-zero measurement for temperature
(AZT), and diagnostic checks (see section 6.3). If AZS is enabled (AZMs_on = 1BIN in register 04HEX;
see Table 34 for details for registers), the sensor measurement (S) and auto-zero measurement for the sensor
(AZS) must be scheduled to always occur together for correct signal processing; i.e., these settings are required:
slots_S = slots_AZS in register 1FHEX and startS_wfirstn = startAZS_wfirstn in register 1EHEX. If AZT is enabled
(AZMt_on = 1BIN in register 04HEX), the temperature measurement (T) and auto-zero measurement for
temperature (AZT) must be scheduled to always occur together for correct signal processing; i.e., these settings
are required: slots_T = slots_AZT and startT_wfirstn = startAZT_wfirstn (see registers 1EHEX and 1FHEX). For
applications where obtaining the fastest possible update rate is the highest priority, disabling the auto-zero
measurements is recommended, i.e., AZM*_on = 0BIN, for which slot scheduling is user programmable without
constraints.
The automatically, continuously running measurement sequence is executed in Cyclic Mode, which is either
entered as the default main operating mode after power-on or entered by means of the START_CYC command,
ABHEX.
Figure 18 shows an example of the measurement sequence configurability. During the pauses in the sequence,
the ZSSC3240 signals that it is not busy (i.e., the Busy? bit = 0BIN in the general status byte; see Table 18). The
available measurement results are updated at the end of each SSC calculation and output operation and are
kept valid at the digital interface or DAC output until the next SSC calculation and output operation.
The configuration of the measurement scheduler is done in the NVM registers 1EHEX to 20HEX.

A slot denotes all measurements that are conducted and updated before the next SSC calculation. There can be
pauses from one slot to the start of the next slot. The first slot has the slot number 0.
If the digital interface clock speed is too slow related to the SSC output update rate in Cyclic Mode, intermediate
results might be lost.

The integrated, programmable digital-to-analog converter (DAC) generates an IC-internal analog signal that can
be output at AOUT as an absolute voltage, VDD-ratiometric voltage, or control signal for an externally connected
current loop circuit. The analog output must be configured by Aout_setup in the SSF2 register, 04HEX.

The ZSSC3240 provides only analog outputs for signals that have been processed by the SSC calculation unit
(see section 6.6.3), or that are directly transferred (via the digital command, DAC-Diagnostic, B3HEX; see Table
33) as input to the DAC; e.g., for test or calibration purposes. The setup parameter dacouttype, bit[3] of the
SSF2 register, 04HEX defines if either the SSC-corrected sensor value, S, or the SSC-corrected temperature
value, T, is provided at AOUT; see Figure 19.

 [a]     tDACsettle is the step-response time for the DAC and analog output stage (only); i.e., the time to reach 99% of the new analog output
         level after a DAC input change. For analog-output smart-sensor step-response time, the time for generating a new SSC-result as
         input to the DAC must also be considered.
For the suppression of spuriously emitted tones in the analog output signal, dithering within the DAC operation
can be enabled/disabled via the dither_off bit in the SSF2 register. If spurious tone emission is irrelevant in the
application, dithering can be switched off in order to improve the analog output signal’s noise level.
For analog diagnostic level signalization, enabled by the diagouten bit = 1BIN in the SSF2 register (see Table 16),
the ZSSC3240 directly ties the analog output signal to 0% or 100% with the selected output stage, supported by
digital pre-scaling to reserve approximately 1.5%-wide signal bands for diagnostic outputs. Strong
recommendation: If the ZSSC3240 provides diagnostic levels, activate analog signalization of diagnostic levels
before sensor calibration.
6.5.3.1.          Voltage Outputs
The ZSSC3240 can provide one of three direct voltage outputs at the AOUT pin. The Aout_setup bit field in the
SSF2 register (bits [7:5]; see Table 34) is used to configure the ZSSC3240 and select the analog voltage output
stage as defined in Table 29. It is also possible to set up the analog voltage output for 0V to 10V systems using
additional external components.

6.5.3.2.      Accuracy and Calibration of the DAC-Output
The 16-bit-DAC of ZSSC3240 is optimized from design prospective for high stability. Low drift over operational
conditions can be achieved with minimal additional effort during the calibration phase, by compensating absolute
errors/mismatches with mathematical adaptation of sensor calibration coefficients.
The functional, analog main-components of the ZSSC3240’s DAC come with some residual level of IC-to-IC
variation for DAC-characteristic’s offset and gain. It is recommended to calibrate the DAC-characteristic and
consider the linearity IC-to-IC-variation of the DAC at the IC’s calibration, especially for applications with high
requirements for absolute accuracy of the output voltage. For analog output configurations, the SSC coefficients
can be derived such that the digital SSC-results and hence the DAC’s digital input (S or T) is pre-shaped in order
to compensate the residual DAC’s (non-)linearity variation.
To avoid taking analog measurement values during the smart sensors’ calibration procedure, the ZSSC3240
provides two high-precision DAC-calibration point measurement results in the NVM, DAC10RM5V and
DAC90RM5V in the NVM registers 22HEX and 23HEX, see Table 34. Using these two high-precision DAC
calibration points for the determination of the SSC-coefficients, the ZSSC3240 achieves a low residual, absolute
DAC-output error of less than ±0.15% over the device specified temperature range, and over the DAC output
swinging from 1% to 100% of the specified range . This approach can be also interpreted as mapping of the
digital SSC-outputs (S or T) to an IC-to-IC-varying best fit straight line characteristic of the DAC. The residual
DAC-error is typically higher in the signal range 0% to 1%, as the ZSSC3240’s does not provide exactly 0V for
zero-value digital DAC-inputs, S or T.
If more than two DAC-calibration points is considered, absolute accuracies below ±0.15% become possible,
down to the analog output (AOUT) line’s noise-and-distortion level.
6.5.3.3.      Current Loop Output
The analog current loop is a typical output signal configuration, especially for industrial sensors. Using only two
wires, the sensor is supplied with power and transmits its output signal to the processing unit. With
Aout_setup = 000BIN (bits [7:5] in the SSF2 register; see Table 34), the ZSSC3240 will generate a SSC-corrected
sensor-signal-proportional control signal at AOUT that allows generating a related loop current according the
application in Figure 20.

Strong recommendation: Use the Zener diode between FB and VDD to protect the VDD line from positive over-
voltage conditions and protect the FB input from negative over-voltages. The 100nF capacitor performs a low-
pass-filter function for short /fast changes in the total current consumption for the sensor element plus the
ZSSC3240 (ISENS + IIC), such that current consumption changes do not lead to short-term fluctuations of AOUT
and the loop current.
An equivalent effect of slight loop current fluctuations might be observable if a sensor-connection check is
sometimes executed between the normal sensor measurements. Here, the connected sensor element, e.g., a
resistive bridge, will be unsupplied briefly in order to determine the electrical connection properties; whereas an
overall load change (sensor measurements → sensor-connection check → sensor-measurement) at VDD and
hence in the current loop will be present. Therefore, diagnostic features should be carefully enabled and
selected for current loop applications that have strong requirements for output signal quality under any
circumstances.

6.5.4.         Output Interrupt Signaling
The EOC pin can be programmed to operate either as a simple “measurement busy” and end-of-conversion
transducer or as a configurable interrupt transducer, which is configured using the INT_setup[1:0] bits in NVM
register 02HEX, bits[8:7]. Further, one or two 24-bit quantized thresholds can be programmed via TRSH1 and
TRSH2 (Interrupt Level Setup registers 18HEX, 19HEX and 1AHEX in NVM; see Table 34). Depending on the
INT_setup selection, the EOC pin provides a logic 1 or logic 0 (also dependent on the respective interface setup;

e.g., SPI with either logic 0 = VDD or logic 0 = VSS, etc.) according to the SSC-corrected measurement result. The
respective thresholds must be programmed left-aligned in the memory with the threshold’s MSB in the memory
register’s MSB, etc. The LSBs of the 24-bit threshold in memory are ignored depending on the number of bits of
the ADC resolution as selected with adc_bits (see Table 10).
In this case, only the effective end-of-conversion is signalized (INT_setup = 00BIN). The EOC signal is a pulse of
approximately 5µs. The next command will be executed only after this EOC signaling period.
The interrupt functionality is only available for digital values from the SSC-calculation unit. The interrupt feature
cannot monitor raw values. The encoding and data format of the interrupt thresholds is the same as for SSC-
corrected measurement results (see Table 32).

6.6        System Setup and Control
The digital blocks of the ZSSC3240 are organized functionally as shown in Figure 22. In addition to the central
blocks, which are the “Interfaces,” “Digital Main Core,” and “Memory (NVM)” blocks, there is also the Shadow
Registers block, which in most cases, is a direct copy of the NVM registers. The shadow registers are loaded
from NVM during the power-up sequence and allow acceleration of command processing and NVM-independent
configuration adaptability; e.g., during adaptive sensor setup, evaluation, or smart sensor test. For the main
function of the ZSSC3240 to conduct a sensor measurement and ADC-conversion, the setups (for main Sensor
or Temperature) are loaded or activated from the corresponding Shadow Registers in order to set all IC-internal
configuration switches for sensor supply, PGA gain, offset compensation, reference voltage sources, etc. After a
settling time for the analog signals and levels, the A2D conversion takes place. This course of activities is
(re-)done for each individual measurement, i.e. once for SM, AZS, TM, AZT, with setups for SM and AZS

according the Shadow Registers for SM_config1 and SM_config2, and for TM, AZT from registers
extTemp_config1 and extTemp_config2. If the internal temperature sensor was selected as signal source for TM,
AZT, the setups are loaded from a Renesas-preprogrammed register different to extTemp_config1 and
extTemp_config2.

  [a]   These commands can be used to conduct a measurement without an SSC correction; e.g., during the smart sensor calibration
        procedure. No digital correction is performed on the measurement result. The setup and configuration for the raw measurement is
        the content in the shadow registers that can be pre-loaded (automatically loaded during power-on) from the NVM or by means of
        the Overwrite commands, D6HEX to DBHEX.
  [b]   Use Oversample measurements to obtain noise-minimized measurement results in Sleep or Command Mode. With higher
        oversampling factors, the command execution time increases proportionally.
  [c]   Overwrite commands can be used to optimize evaluation and test routine execution time for analog front-end setup or to configure
        self-diagnostic measurement setups without needing to change the ZSSC3240’s NVM content. The content and effects from
        Overwrite commands are cleared and reset with the ZSSC3240 reset via the RESQ pin or POR.
6.6.2.         Nonvolatile Memory (NVM)
In the ZSSC3240, the memory is organized in 16-bit wide registers and can be programmed multiple times
(approximately 10000). There are 54 × 16-bit registers available for customer use. Each register can be re-
programmed.
Basically, there are two NVM content sectors:
•  Customer Use: Accessible via regular write operations: 40HEX to 75HEX. This sector contains the customer ID,
   interface setup data, measurement setup information, calibration coefficients, analog output configuration, etc.
•  Renesas Use: Only accessible for write operations by Renesas. This sector (36HEX to 3FHEX) contains
   specific trim information and is programmed during manufacturing test by Renesas, e.g. setups for the internal
   temperature sensor are stored there.
The whole NVM can be locked by programming lock = 1BIN in the SSF1 register, NVM address 03HEX, bit[14]. No
change of the NVM content is possible once the NVM lock has been activated.
Recommendations when using the NVM lock:
•  Write all required setups, configurations, and SSC coefficients to the NVM first.
•  Then write the SSF1 register content with the lock bit set.
•  Then trigger the generation and writing of the CRC via the Calculate NVM Checksum command, 90HEX.
The NVM lock will be effective after a ZSSC3240 reset with POR or RESQ.

 [a] For I3C operation, this should contain the Legacy Virtual Register (LVR) information: 1XHEX to Index 0. Fast-Mode is supported.
 [b] Use the extTemp_config1 and extTemp_config2 registers for temperature sensor related front-end configuration.
 [c] In Current Loop Operation Mode, it must be ensured that a sufficient external VDD-level > 4.8V is present (e.g., with external supply
     transistor, such as JFET or depletion MOSFET, and extra LDO-control option).
 [d] If pga_en_shift is enabled, the ZSSC3240 current consumption increases by approximately 100µA. Usage is recommended for
     optimizing the analog front-end setup.
 [e] The IC provides the originally measured DAC-output voltage VDAC*0,AOUT[V] with VDD=5V, Aout_setup=(001BIN or 101BIN) as reaction on
     B3HEX command, see Table 33.
The NVM-consistence checksum is calculated (internally by the ZSSC3240 for the whole NVM) using the
polynomial: x16 + x15 + x2 + 1. The checksum verification is only realized directly after VDD power-on. If the
checksum is successfully verified, then the “Memory Error” status bit is set to 0BIN.

6.6.3.        Digital Sensor-Signal-Conditioning Mathematics
The saturation check (signalized by SSC Calculation Unit Saturation, see Table 16) in the ZSSC3240 detects
saturation effects of the internal calculation steps, allowing the final correction output to be determined despite
the saturation. It is possible to get potentially useful signal conditioning results that have had an intermediate
saturation during the calculations. These cases are detectable; e.g., by observing the status bit[0] for each
measurement result. Details about the saturation limits and the valid ranges for values are provided in the
equations in the following sections.
The calibration math description assumes a calculation with integer numbers. The description is numerically
correct concerning values, dynamic range, and resolution.
6.6.3.1.       Sensor Signal Correction
The configuration parameter SOT_curve in NVM register 02HEX selects whether second-order equations
compensate for sensor nonlinearity with a parabolic or S-shaped curve. The parabolic compensation is
recommended for most sensor types.
The following equations describe the available SSC capabilities. The equation terms are as follows:
    S         Corrected sensor reading output via I2C, OWI, or SPI; range [0HEX to FFFFFFHEX]
    S_Raw           Raw sensor reading from ADC (after AZ correction, if selected); range [-7FFFFFHEX to
                    7FFFFFHEX]
    Gain_S Sensor gain term; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    Offset_S Sensor offset term; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    Tcg          Temperature coefficient gain term; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    Tco          Temperature coefficient offset term; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    T_Raw Raw temperature reading (after AZ correction); range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    SOT_tcg Second-order term for Tcg non-linearity; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    SOT_tco Second-order term for Tco non-linearity; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    SOT_sens Second-order term for sensor non-linearity; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    SENS_shift Post-calibration, post-assembly offset shift; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
                Absolute value
     [] ulll   Bound/saturation number range from ll to ul, overflow/underflow is reported as saturation in the
                status byte
The correction formula for the differential signal reading is represented as a two-step process depending on the
SOT_curve setting.

6.6.3.2.         Temperature Signal Correction
Temperature is measured either internally by the ZSSC3240 or through an additional external element or by
means of a combination of ZSSC3240-internal and external temperature sensing capabilities; see sections 6.2.3
and 6.2.4. Temperature correction contains both linear gain and offset terms as well as a second-order term to
correct for any nonlinearities. For temperature, second-order compensation for nonlinearity is always parabolic.
The correction equation terms are as follows:
    T          Corrected temperature sensor reading output via digital interface; range [0HEX to FFFFFFHEX]
    Gain_T Gain coefficient for temperature; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    T_Raw Raw temperature reading after AZ correction; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    Offset_T Offset coefficient for temperature; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 0x7FFFFFHEX]
    SOT_T Second-order term for temperature source nonlinearity; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
    T_Shift Shift for post-calibration/post-assembly offset compensation [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
The correction formula is best represented as a two-step process as follows:

ZSSC3240
6.7       External, Extra LDO (LDOctrl) for Applications for > 5.5V
The ZSSC3240 has integrated voltage regulators that generate separate analog and digital ZSSC3240-internal
voltages for any valid external supply voltage, VDD (2.7V to 5.5V). For proper ZSSC3240 function, the directly
applied supply voltage should not exceed the maximum VDD limit.
The ZSSC3240 also supports applications with higher application-inherent supply voltages greater than 5.5V.
The ZSSC3240 provides a voltage regulation signal at the LDOctrl pin and a programmable IC supply, i.e. VDD-
level regulation target level, VDD_ldoctrl_target in the SSF2 register. The use of an additional external regulator
transistor (by means of, for example JFET, depletion MOSFET, or comparable) further improves the power-
supply rejection ratio (PSRR); i.e., it reduces effects from the external supply voltage onto the sensor
measurement results in addition to the ZSSC3240-internal regulator properties. If the external extra supply
regulation is not used or needed, the respective feature should be disabled by disable_ldoctrl = 1BIN.

Recommendation: Use the clamping diode at VDD (to FB for current-loop output configurations or to VSS in all
other cases with external LDO as shown by gray dashed line in Figure 22) to ensure over-voltage protection at
the initial application power-on. The external transistor, depicted as JFET 1 can be a real JFET type, or, for
example, depletion MOSFET and comparable. It must be selected such that the drain-source voltage can be at
least VDDext – 5V.

7.      Calibration
Calibration essentially involves collecting raw signal and temperature data from the sensor-ZSSC3240 system
for different known sensor-element values (i.e., for a resistive bridge or an absolute voltage source) and
temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the calibration master (assumed to be the user’s
computer), and the calculated calibration coefficients can then be written to on-chip memory.
Brief overview of the three mains steps involved in calibrating the ZSSC3240:
1. Assigning a unique identification to the ZSSC3240. This identification is written to shadow RAM and
      programmed in NVM. This unique identification can be stored in the two 16-bit registers dedicated to the
      customer ID. It can be used as an index into a database stored on the calibration PC. This database will
      contain all the raw values of the connected sensor-element readings and temperature readings for that part,
      as well as the known sensor-element measurand conditions and temperature to which the sensor-element
      was exposed.
2. Data collection. Data collection involves getting uncorrected (raw) data from the external sensor at different
      known measurand values and temperatures. Then this data is stored on the calibration master using the
      unique identification of the device as the index to the database.
3. Coefficient calculation and storage in NVM. After enough data points have been collected to calculate all the
      desired coefficients, the coefficients can be calculated by the calibration master. Then the coefficients can be
      programmed to the memory.
4. Result. The sensor signal and the characteristic temperature effect on output will be linearized according to
      the setup-dependent maximum output range.
It is essential to perform the calibration with a fixed programming setup during the data collection phase.
Strong recommendation: To prevent any accidental misprocessing, keep the sensor front-end NVM setup
(registers SSF1, SSF2, SM_config1, SM_config2, extTemp_config1, extTemp_config2) stable during the entire
calibration process as well as in the subsequent operation.
Note: A ZSSC3240 calibration only fits the setup used during its calibration. Changes of functional parameters
after a successful calibration can decrease the precision and accuracy performance of the ZSSC3240 as well as
of the entire application.
