NOTES
1
  VA and VB represent the Mean Average Deviation (MAD) of the detected sine waves. Note that for this Transfer Function to linearly represent positive displacement,
  the sum of V A and VB of the LVDT must remain constant with stroke length. See “Theory of Operation.” Also see Figures 7 and 12 for R2.
2
  From TMIN, to TMAX, the overall error due to the AD598 alone is determined by combining gain error, gain drift and offset drift. For example the worst case overall
  error for the AD598AD from TMIN to TMAX is calculated as follows: overall error = gain error at +25°C (± 1% full scale) + gain drift from –40°C to +25°C (50 ppm/°C
  of FS × +65°C) + offset drift from –40°C to +25°C (50 ppm/°C of FS × +65°C) = ± 1.65% of full scale. Note that 1000 ppm of full scale equals 0.1% of full scale.
  Full scale is defined as the voltage difference between the maximum positive and maximum negative output.
3
  Nonlinearity of the AD598 only, in units of ppm of full scale. Nonlinearity is defined as the maximum measured deviation of the AD598 output voltage from a
  straight line. The straight line is determined by connecting the maximum produced full-scale negative voltage with the maximum produced full-scale positive voltage.

  See Transfer Function.

  This offset refers to the (V A–VB)/(VA+VB) input spanning a full-scale range of ± 1. [For (VA–VB)/(VA+VB) to equal +1, V B must equal zero volts; and correspondingly
  for (VA–VB)/(VA+VB) to equal –1, VA must equal zero volts. Note that offset errors do not allow accurate use of zero magnitude inputs, practical inputs are limited to
  100 mV rms.] The ± 1 span is a convenient reference point to define offset referred to input. For example, with this input span a value of R2 = 20 k Ω would give
  VOUT span a value of ± 10 volts. Caution, most LVDTs will typically exercise less of the ((V A–VB))/((VA+VB)) input span and thus require a larger value of R2 to
  produce the ± 10 V output span. In this case the offset is correspondingly magnified when referred to the output voltage. For example, a Schaevitz E100 LVDT
   requires 80.2 kΩ for R2 to produce a ± 10.69 V output and (V A–VB)/(VA+VB) equals 0.27. This ratio may be determined from the graph shown in Figure 18,
  (VA–VB)/(VA+VB) = (1.71 V rms – 0.99 V rms)/(1.71 V rms + 0.99 V rms). The maximum offset value referred to the ± 10.69 V output may be determined by
  multiplying the maximum value shown in the data sheet (± 1% of FS by 1/0.27 which equals ± 3.7% maximum. Similarly, to determine the maximum values of offset
  drift, offset CMRR and offset PSRR when referred to the ± 10.69 V output, these data sheet values should also be multiplied by (1/0.27). For this example for the
  AD598AD the maximum values of offset drift, PSRR offset and CMRR offset would be: 185 ppm/ °C of FS; 741 ppm/V and 741 ppm/V respectively when referred
  to the ± 10.69 V output.

  For example, if the excitation to the primary changes by 1 dB, the gain of the system will change by typically 100 ppm.
7
  Output ripple is a function of the AD598 bandwidth determined by C2, C3 and C4. See Figures 16 and 17.

  R1 is shown in Figures 7 and 12.

  Excitation voltage drift is not an important specification because of the ratiometric operation of the AD598.

Gain Phase Characteristics
To use an LVDT in a closed loop mechanical servo application,
it is necessary to know the dynamic characteristics of the trans-
ducer and interface elements. The transducer itself is very quick
to respond once the core is moved. The dynamics arise prima-
rily from the interface electronics. Figures 13, 14 and 15 show
the frequency response of the AD598 LVDT Signal Condi-
tioner. Note that Figures 14 and 15 are basically the same; the
difference is frequency range covered. Figure 14 shows a wider
range of mechanical input frequencies at the expense of accu-
racy. Figure 15 shows a more limited frequency range with en-
hanced accuracy. The figures are transfer functions with the
input to be considered as a sinusoidally varying mechanical posi-
tion and the output as the voltage from the AD598; the units of
the transfer function are volts per inch. The value of C2, C3 and
C4, from Figure 7, are all equal and designated as a parameter
in the figures. The response is approximately that of two real
poles. However, there is appreciable excess phase at higher fre-
quencies. An additional pole of filtering can be introduced with
a shunt capacitor across R2, (see Figure 7); this will also in-
crease phase lag.
When selecting values of C2, C3 and C4 to set the bandwidth of
the system, a trade-off is involved. There is ripple on the “dc”
position output voltage, and the magnitude is determined by the
filter capacitors. Generally, smaller capacitors will give higher
system bandwidth and larger ripple. Figures 16 and 17 show the
magnitude of ripple as a function of C2, C3 and C4, again all                Figure 14. Gain and Phase Characteristics vs. Frequency

This weigh-scale can be designed to measure tare weight simply
by putting in an offset voltage by selecting either R3 or R4 (as
shown in Figures 7 and 12). Tare weight is the weight of a con-
tainer that is deducted from the gross weight to obtain the net
weight.
