The 3-wire SPI™-compatible interface can be readily
connected to a variety of microcontrollers.
The MAX6682 is a read-only device, simplifying use in
systems where only temperature data is required.                                        Ordering Information
Power-management circuitry reduces the average ther-
mistor current, minimizing self-heating. Between con-                PART              TEMP RANGE           PIN-PACKAGE

surements.
The MAX6682 is available in a small, 8-pin µMAX pack-
age and is specified over the -55°C to +125°C temper-
ature range.

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
