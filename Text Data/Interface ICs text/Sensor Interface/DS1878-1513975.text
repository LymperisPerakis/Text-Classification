Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

         Note 1:    All voltages are referenced to ground. Current into the IC is positive, and current out of the IC is negative.
         Note 2:    Inputs are at supply rail. Outputs are not loaded.
         Note 3:    Eight ranges allow the full-scale range to change from 312mV to 1.25V.
         Note 4:    The output impedance of the device is proportional to its scale setting. For instance, if using the 1/2 scale, the output
                    impedance is 1.5kΩ.
         Note 5:    This parameter is guaranteed by design.
         Note 6:    Full-scale is programmable.
         Note 7:    A temperature conversion is completed and the MODULATION register value is recalled from the LUT and VCC has been
                    measured to be above the VCC LO alarm.
         Note 8:    The timing is determined by the choice of the SAMPLE RATE setting (see Table 02h, Register 88h).
         Note 9:    This specification is the time it takes from MON3 voltage falling below the LLOS trip threshold to LOSOUT asserted high.
         Note 10:   This specification is the time it takes from MON3 voltage rising above the HLOS trip threshold to LOSOUT asserted low.
         Note 11:   Assuming an appropriate initial step is programmed that would cause the power to exceed the APC set point within four
                    steps, the bias current will be within 3% within the time specified by the binary search time. See the BIAS and MODULA-
                    TION Control During Power-Up section.
         Note 12:   I2C interface timing shown is for fast-mode (400kHz) operation. This device is also backward compatible with I2C stan-
                    dard-mode timing.
         Note 13:   CB—the total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
         Note 14:   EEPROM write begins after a STOP condition occurs.

         The register maps show each byte/word (2 bytes) in terms of its row in the memory. The first byte in the row is locat-
         ed in memory at the row address (hexadecimal) in the leftmost column. Each subsequent byte on the row is one/two
         memory locations beyond the previous byte/word’s address. A total of 8 bytes are present on each row. For more
         information about each of these bytes see the corresponding register description.

The ALARM ENABLE bytes (Registers F8h–FFh) can be configured to exist in Table 05h instead of here at Table 01h
with the MASK bit (Table 02h, Register 89h). If the row is configured to exist in Table 05h, then these locations are
empty in Table 01h.
The access codes represent the factory default values of PW_ENA and PW_ENB (Table 02h, Registers C0h–C1h).

           C7h, respectively. The calculation of TINDEX is as follows:
                                                              Temp _ Value + 40°C
                                                   TINDEX =                       + 80h

           For the temperature-indexed LUTs, the index used during the lookup function for each table is as follows:

             ISTEP is the initial step value used at power-on or after a TXD pulse to control the BIAS register. The particular
             ISTEP used depends on the value of TINDEX and ISTEPTI (Table 02h, Register C5h). When TINDEX > ISTEPTI,
             ISTEPH is used. When TINDEX < ISTEPTI, ISTEPL is used. At startup, this value plus 20 = 1 is continuously added
             to the BIAS register value until the APC feedback (MON2) is greater than its threshold. At that time, a binary
             search is used to complete the startup of the APC closed loop. If the resulting math operation is greater than
             IBIASMAX (Table 02h, Register EEh), the result is not loaded into the BIAS register, but the binary search is
             begun to complete the initial search for APC. During startup, the BIAS register steps causing a higher bias value

              Fast-comparison DAC threshold adjust for high LOS. The combination of HLOS and LLOS creates a hysteresis
              comparator. As RSSI falls below the LLOS threshold, the LOS LO alarm bit is set to 1. The LOS alarm remains set
              until the RSSI input is found above the HLOS threshold setting, which clears the LOS LO alarm bit and sets the
              LOS HI alarm bit. At power-on, both LOS LO and LOS HI alarm bits are 0 and the hysteresis comparator uses the
              LLOS threshold setting.

                        of BIAS output during APC closed-loop operations. During the intial step and binary search, this value does not
                        cause an alarm but still clamps the BIAS register value. After the startup seqence (or normal APC operations), if
                        the APC loop tries to create a BIAS value greater than this setting, it is clamped and creates a MAX BIAS alarm.

                        The digital value for the modulation DAC output. The MODULATION LUT is a set of registers assigned to hold the
                        temperature profile for the MODULATION register. The temperature measurement is used to index the LUT
                        (TINDEX, Table 02h, Register 81h) in 2°C increments from -40°C to +102°C, starting at 80h. Register 80h defines
                        the -40°C to -38°C MOD output, Register 81h defines the -38°C to -36°C MOD output, and so on. Values recalled
                        from this EEPROM memory table are written into the MODULATION register (Table 02h, Register 82h–83h)
                        location that holds the value until the next temperature conversion. The device can be placed into a manual
                        mode (MOD EN bit, Table 02h, Register 80h), where the MODULATION register is directly controlled for
                        calibration. If the temperature compensation functionality is not required, then program the entire Table 04h to the
                        desired modulation setting. The MODTC bit determines whether the 8-bit LUT values are loaded into the upper 8
                        bits or lower 8 bits of the 9-bit MOD DAC. See the BIAS and MODULATION Control During Power-Up section for
