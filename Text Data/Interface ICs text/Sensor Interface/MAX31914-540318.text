Note 2: If a 24V supply is not available, the device can be powered through 5VOUT. In this mode of operation, the VCC24V
         supply must be left unconnected. All other specifications remain identical. The field-supply alarms are asserted indicating
         the absence of the 24V supply in this mode of operation.
Note 3: When using suggested external 2.2kΩ series resistors, limits of -36V to +36V apply.
Note 4: When input current switching is enabled (DB0/DB1 = 0), there is no input threshold hysteresis. In this case, the input
         threshold for both falling and rising signals is the high to low threshold.
Note 5: External resistor RREF can be adjusted to set any desired current limit between 0.5mA and 6mA.
Note 6: INn-to-OPn propagation delay difference between two channels on the same IC.
Note 7: Propagation delay from field input (INn) to CMOS output (OPn). Tested with a 6.5V pulse applied directly to the device INn
         pins. Propagation delay is measured between the 50% transitions of the rising and falling edges.
Note 8: The propagation delay limit is 1ms maximum when VTSEL = 0.

Powering the Device Through the 5VOUT Pin
The device can also be powered using a 5V supply
connected to the 5VOUT pin. In this case, a 24V supply
is no longer needed and the VCC24V supply must be
kept unconnected (see Figure 2)
In this configuration, the device will always indicate a
UVFAULT and the FAULT pin will always be active (pulled
low). Faults due to the Supply Voltage monitoring and
Temperature Monitoring will not be available.
This configuration has lower power consumption and
heat dissipation since the on-chip 5V voltage regulator is
disabled.
