   1.1.         Absolute Maximum Ratings
   Note: The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The device might not function or be operable above
   the operating conditions given in section 1.2. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also
   damage the device. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions
   might affect device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute Maximum Ratings.”

     1)  Note that the maximum EEPROM programming temperature is 85°C.
     2)  If buying die, designers should use caution not to exceed maximum junction temperature by proper package selection.
     3)  Only needed for Analog Output Mode; not needed for Digital Output Mode. When a pull-down resistor is used as the load resistor, the power loss
         detection diagnostic for loss of VSS cannot be assured at RL=5k; RL=10k is recommended for this configuration.
     4)  Note: for unlocked devices or during calibration, the minimum value of output load resistance to VSS is 20kΩ.
     5)  Using the output for digital calibration, CL,OUT is limited by the maximum rise time tZAC,rise. See section 1.3.8.
     6)  Note: Minimum bridge resistance is a factor if using the Bsink feature. The rds(on) of the Bsink transistor is 8 to 10Ω when operating at VDD=5V. This does
         give rise to a ratiometricity inaccuracy that becomes greater with low bridge resistances.
     7)  Note: Minimum bridge resistance is important if using certain diagnostic features. It must be at least 0.3kΩ at VDD=2.7V and at least 0.6kΩ at VDD=5V for
         the Sensor Short Check to function properly. For details, see section 2.6.3.

      1)  Note: This is  4 LSBs for the 14-bit A-to-D conversion. This results in absolute accuracy to 12-bits on the A-to-D result. Non-linearity is typically better at
          temperatures less than 125°C.
      2)  When using a pull-down resistor as the load resistor, the power loss detection diagnostic for loss of VSS cannot be assured at RL=5kΩ; RL=10kΩ is
           recommended for this configuration.
      3)  Not included is the quantization noise of the DAC. The 12-bit DAC has a quantization noise of  ½ LSB = 0.61mV (@ 5V VDD) = 0.0125%.

   1.4.         Analog Inputs versus Output Resolution
   The ZSC31015 has a fully differential chopper-stabilized pre-amplifier with four programmable gain settings. The
   output of the pre-amplifier feeds into a 14-bit charge-balanced ADC. Span, offset, temperature, and non-linearity
   correction are performed in the digital domain. Then the resulting corrected bridge value can be output in analog
   form through a 12-bit DAC or as a 16-bit serial digital packet. The resolution of the output depends on the input
   span (bridge sensitivity) and the analog gain setting programmed. Digital gains can vary from [0,32). Analog gains
   available are 6, 24, 48, and 96.
   Note: At higher analog gain settings, there will be higher output resolution, but the ability of the ZSC31015 to
   handle large offsets decreases. This is expected because the offset is also amplified by the analog gain and can
   therefore saturate the ADC input.

   2            Circuit Description
   2.1.         Signal Flow and Block Diagram
   The ZSC31015 resistive bridge sensor interface ICs were specifically designed as cost-effective solutions for
   sensing in building automation, automotive *, industrial, office automation and white goods applications. The
   ZSC31015 employs IDT’s high precision bandgap with proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) output; low-
   power 14-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A2D, A-to-D); and an on-chip DSP core with EEPROM to precisely
   calibrate the bridge output signal.
   Three selectable outputs, two analog and one digital, offer the ultimate in versatility across many applications.
   The ZSC31015 rail-to-rail ratiometric analog Vout signal (0V to ~5 V Vout @ VDD=5V) suits most building automation
   and automotive requirements (12-bit resolution). Typical office automation and white goods applications require
   the 0 to ~1V Vout signal, which in the ZSC31015 is referenced to the internal bandgap. The ZSC31015 is capable
   of running in high-voltage (5.5 to 30V) systems when combined with an external JFET.
   Direct interfacing to P controllers is facilitated via IDT’s single-wire serial ZACwire™ digital interface.

                                                                                                    ZSC31015 Datasheet
   2.2.       Analog Front End
   2.2.1.     Bandgap/PTAT and PTAT Amplifier
   The highly linear Bandgap/PTAT section provides the PTAT signal to the ADC, which allows accurate tempera-
   ture conversion. In addition, the ultra-low ppm Bandgap provides a stable voltage reference over temperature for
   the operation of the rest of the IC. If the bridge is not near the ZSC31015, an external diode can be used for
   temperature measurement/compensation.
   The temperature signal (internal PTAT or external diode) is amplified through a path in the Pre-Amp and fed to
   the ADC for conversion. The most significant 12-bits of this converted result are used for temperature
   measurement and temperature correction of bridge readings. When temperature is output in Digital Mode, only
   the most significant 8 bits are given.
   When external temperature is selected, add a diode from the ExtTemp pin to ground. The diode is biased with
   approximately 50µA during temperature measurement cycles. The voltage level on ExtTemp is amplified through
   the Pre-Amp and converted by the ADC. Ensure that the ExtTemp signal is in the range of 150mV to 800mV to
   prevent saturation of the ADC. If the selected diode has a sensitivity in the range of 1.9mV/oC to 3.25mV/oC, a
   corrected temperature output (in Digital Mode) can be achieved for a 200oC temperature span (-50oC to 150oC).
   2.2.2.     Bridge Supply
   The voltage-driven bridge is usually connected to VDD and ground. As a power savings feature, the ZSC31015
   also includes a switched transistor to interrupt the bridge current via pin 1 (Bsink). The transistor switching is
   synchronized to the analog-to-digital conversion and released after finishing the conversion. To utilize this feature,
   the low supply of the bridge should be connected to Bsink instead of ground.
   Depending on the programmable update rate, the average current consumption (including bridge current) can be
   reduced to approximately 20%, 5%, or 1%. Note: this feature has no power savings benefit if using the fastest
   update rate mode.
   2.2.3.     PREAMP Block
   The differential signal from the bridge is amplified through a chopper-stabilized instrumentation amplifier with very
   high input impedance designed for low noise and low drift. This pre-amp provides gain for the differential signal
   and re-centers its DC to VDD/2. The output of the Pre-Amp block is fed into the ADC. The calibration sequence
   performed by the digital core includes an auto-zero sequence to null any drift in the Pre-Amp state over
   temperature.
   The Pre-Amp can be set to a gain of 6, 24, 48, or 96 through an EEPROM setting.
   The inputs to the Pre-Amp from (VBN/VBP pins) can be reversed via an EEPROM configuration bit.

                                                                                                      ZSC31015 Datasheet
   2.2.4.     Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
   A 14-bit/1ms 2nd order charge-balancing ADC is used to convert signals coming from the pre-amplifier. The
   converter, designed in full differential switched capacitor technique, is used for converting the various signals in
   the digital domain.
   This principle offers the following advantages:
           High noise immunity because of the differential signal path and integrating behavior
           Independence from clock frequency drift and clock jitter
           Fast conversion time due to second-order mode
   Four selectable values for the zero point of the input voltage allow conversion to adapt to the sensor’s offset
   parameter. With the Reverse Input Polarity Mode and the negative digital gain options, this results in seven
   possible zero point adjustments (not eight because the -1/2,1/2 offset setting is the same regardless of gain
   polarity).
   The conversion rate varies with the programmed update rate. The fastest conversation rate is 1k samples/s and
   the response time is then 1ms. Based on a best fit, the Integral Nonlinearity (INL) is less than 4 LSB14Bit.
   2.3.       Digital Signal Processor
   A digital signal processor (DSP) is used for processing the converted bridge data as well as performing
   temperature correction and computing the temperature value for output on the digital channel.
   The digital core reads correction coefficients from EEPROM and can correct for the following:
         Bridge Offset
         Bridge Gain
         Variation of Bridge Offset over Temperature (Tco)
         Variation of Bridge Gain over Temperature (Tcg)
         A single second order effect (SOT) (Second Order Term)
   The EEPROM contains a single SOT that can be applied to correct one and only one of the following:
       2nd order behavior of bridge measurement
       2nd order behavior of Tco
       2nd order behavior of Tcg

                                                                                                      ZSC31015 Datasheet
   If the SOT applies to correcting the bridge reading, then the correction formula for the bridge reading is
   represented as a two-step process as follows:
            ZB  Gain_ B(1 T  Tcg)  (BR _ Raw  Offset _ B  T  Tco)                                (1)
            BR  ZB(1.25  SOT  ZB)                                                                      (2)
   Where:
             BR         =     Corrected Bridge reading that is output as digital or analog on the SIGTM pin
             ZB         =     Intermediate result in the calculations
             BR_Raw =         Raw Bridge reading from ADC
             T_Raw      =     Raw Temp reading converted from PTAT signal or external diode
             Gain_B =         Bridge Gain term
             Offset_B =       Bridge Offset term
             Tcg        =     Temperature Coefficient Gain
             Tco        =     Temperature Coefficient Offset
             T         =     (T_Raw – TSETL)
             TSETL      =     T_Raw reading at which low calibration was performed (typically 25°C)
             SOT        =     Second-Order Term
   Note      For solving equation (1) the following condition must be met:
             BR _ Raw  BR / Gain_ B
   If this condition is not met, the analog Pre-Amp Gain must be set to a smaller value because a negative Offset_B
   is not supported.
   If the SOT applies to correcting the 2nd order behavior of Tco, then the formula for bridge correction is as follows:
             BR  Gain_ B(1 T  Tcg)  [BR _ Raw  Offset _ B  T(SOT  T  Tco)]                     (3)
   If the SOT applies to correcting the 2nd order behavior of Tcg, then the formula for bridge correction is as follows:
             BR  Gain_ B[1 T(SOT  T  Tcg)]  [BR _ Raw  Offset _ B  T  Tco]                     (4)
   The bandgap reference gives a very linear PTAT signal, so temperature correction can always simply be
   accomplished with a linear gain and offset term.

                                                                                                         ZSC31015 Datasheet
   Corrected Temperature Reading:
           T  Gain_ T(T _ Raw  Offset _ T)                                                                  (5)
   Where:
            T_Raw      =   Raw Temperature reading converted from PTAT signal or external diode
            Offset_T =     Offset Coefficient for Temperature
            Gain_T     =   Gain Coefficient for Temperature
   2.3.1.     EEPROM
   The EEPROM contains the calibration coefficients for gain and offset, etc., and the configuration bits, such as
   output mode, update rate, etc. The ZSC31015 also offers three user-programmable storage bytes for module
   traceability. When programming the EEPROM, an internal charge pump voltage is used; therefore a high voltage
   supply is not needed. The EEPROM is implemented as a shift register. During an EEPROM read, the contents
   are shifted 8 bits before each transmission of one byte occurs. The charge pump is internally regulated to 12.5 V,
   and the programming time is 6ms.
   See section 2.6.1 regarding EEPROM signatures for verifying EEPROM integrity.
   Note: EEPROM writing can only be performed at temperatures lower than 85ºC.
   2.3.2.     One-Wire Interface – ZACwire™
   The IC communicates via a one-wire serial interface. There are different commands available for the following:
           Reading the conversion result of the ADC (Get_BR_Raw, Get_T_Raw)
           Calibration commands
           Reading from the EEPROM (“dump” of entire contents)
           Writing to the EEPROM (trim setting, configuration, and coefficients)
   2.4.       Output Stage
   2.4.1.     Digital to Analog Converter (Output DAC) with Programmable Clipping Limits
   A 12-bit DAC based on sub-ranging resistor strings is used for the digital-to-analog output conversion in the
   analog ratiometric and absolute analog voltage modes. Options during calibration configure the system to operate
   in either of these modes. The design allows for excellent testability as well as low power consumption. The DAC
   allows programming a lower and upper clipping limit (Low_Clip_Lim and Up_Clip_Lim bit fields respectively; see
   section 3.5) for the output signal (analog and digital). The internal 14-bit calculated bridge value is compared
   against the 14-bit value formed by {11,Up_Clip_Lim[6:0],11111} for the upper limit and against
   {00,Low_Clip_Lim[6:0],00000} for the lower limit. If the calculated bridge value is higher than the upper limit or
   less than the lower limit, the analog output value is clipped to this value; otherwise it is output as is.

                                                                                                     ZSC31015 Datasheet
   Example for the upper clipping level: If the Up_Clip_Lim[6:0] = 0000000, then the 14-bit value used for the
   clipping threshold is 11000000011111. This is 75.19% of full scale. Since there are 7 bits of upper clipping limit,
   there are 127 possible values between 75.19% and 100%. Therefore the resolution of the clipping limits 0.195%.
   Example for the lower clipping level: If the Low_Clip_Lim[6:0] = 1111111, then the 14-bit value used for the
   clipping threshold is 00111111100000. This is 24.8% of full scale. Since there are 7 bits of lower clipping limit,
   there are 127 possible values between 0 and 24.8%. Therefore the resolution of the lower clipping limit is 0.195%.

   2.4.2.     Output Buffer
   A rail-to-rail op amp configured as a unity gain buffer can drive resistive loads (whether pull-up or pull-down) as
   low as 5k and capacitances up to 15nF (for pure analog output). In addition, to limit the error due to amplifier
   offset voltage, an error compensation circuit is included which tracks and reduces offset voltage to < 1mV. The
   output of the ZSC31015 output can be permanently shorted to VDD or VSS without damaging the device. The
   output driver contains a current-limiting block that detects a hard short and limits the current to a safe level. The
   short circuit protection current can vary from a minimum of 3mA to a maximum of 40mA depending on operating
   conditions. Output short circuit protection can be enabled via Diag_cfg (EEPROM [102:100]). Enabling this
   protection is recommended when using the analog output.
   2.4.3.     Voltage Reference Block
   A linear regulator control circuit is included in the Voltage Reference Block to interface with an external JFET to
   allow operation in systems where the supply voltage exceeds 5.5V. This circuit can also be used for over-voltage
   protection. The regulator set point has a coarse adjustment controlled by the JFET_cfg EEPROM bits that can
   adjust the set point around 5.0 or 5.5V. (See Table 3.5 for bit locations and section 2.3.1 regarding writing to the
   EEPROM.). The 1V trim setting (see below) can also act as a fine adjust for the regulation set point. The 5V
   reference can be trimmed within +/-15mV.
   Note: If using the external JFET for over-voltage protection purposes (i.e., 5V at JFET drain and expecting 5V at
   JFET source), there will be a voltage drop across the JFET; therefore ratiometricity will be slightly compromised
   depending on the rds(on) of the chosen JFET. A Vishay J107 is the best choice because it has only an 8mV drop
   worst case. If using as regulation instead of over-voltage protection, a MMBF4392 or BSS169 also works well.

   The Voltage Reference Block uses the absolute reference voltage provided by the bandgap to produce two
   regulated on-chip voltage references. A 1V reference is used for the output DAC high reference when the part is
   configured in 0-1V Analog Output Mode. For this reason, the 1V reference must be very accurate and includes
   trim so that its value can be trimmed within +/- 3mV of 1.00V. The 1V reference is also used as the on-chip
   reference for the JFET regulator block. The regulation set point of the JFET regulator can be fine-tuned using the
   1V trim.
   The reference trim setting is selected with the 1V_Trim/JFET_Trim bits in EEPROM. See Table 3.5 for bit
   locations. Table 2.1 shows the order of trim codes with 0111 for the lowest reference voltage and 1000 for the
   highest reference voltage.
   Important: Optimal reference trim is determined during wafer-level testing and final package testing. Back-up
   copies of these bits are stored in bits in the CUST_ID0 bits for applications requiring accurate references. In this
   case, see section 5 for important notes and instructions for verifying the integrity of the 1V_Trim/JFET_Trim bits
   and if necessary, restoring the value from the CUST_ID0 bits before calibration.

   2.5.       Clock Generator / Power-On Reset (CLKPOR)
   If the power supply exceeds 2.5V (maximum), the reset signal de-asserts and the clock generator starts working
   at a frequency of approximately 512kHz (±20%). The exact value only influences the conversion cycle time and
   communication to the outside world but not the accuracy of signal processing. In addition, to minimize the
   oscillator error as the VDD voltage changes, an on-chip regulator is used to supply the oscillator block.
   2.5.1.     Trimming the Oscillator
   Settings for the Osc_Trim bits in EEPROM fine-tune the oscillator frequency. See Table 3.5 for bit locations and
   Table 2.2 for possible settings. The default value is 0HEX to ensure communication on start-up.
   Important: Optimal oscillator trimming is determined during wafer-level testing and final package testing, and this
   part-specific factory value, which can be copied to Osc_Trim, is stored in bits in the CUST_ID1 and CUST_ID2
   EEPROM bits for applications requiring optimal response time. In this case, see section 5 for important notes and
   instructions for copying these optimal values to the Osc_Trim bits before calibration. It is strongly recommended
   that only the default value or the factory trim value be used because ZACwireTM communication is not guaranteed
   at different oscillator frequencies.

   2.6. Diagnostic Features
   The ZSC31015 offers a full suite of diagnostic features to ensure robust system operation in the most “mission-
   critical” applications. If the part is programmed in Analog Output Mode, then diagnostic states are indicated by
   an output below 2.5% of VDD or above 97.5% of VDD. If the part is programmed in Digital Output Mode, then
   diagnostic states will be indicated by a transmission with a generated parity error.
   Table 2.3 gives a summary of the diagnostic features, which are explained in detail in the following sections.
   EEPROM settings that control diagnostic functions are given in section 3.5.

   2.6.1.       EEPROM Integrity
   The contents of the EEPROM are protected by an 8-bit LFSR signature (linear feedback shift register). This sig-
   nature is regenerated and stored in EEPROM every time EEPROM contents are changed. This signature is gen-
   erated and checked for a match after Power-On-Reset prior to entering Normal Operation Mode. If the generated
   signature fails to match, the part will output a diagnostic state on the output.
   In addition to an extensive temporal and code interlock mechanism used to prevent false writes to the EEPROM,
   the ZSC31015 offers an EEPROM lock mechanism for high-security applications. When EEPROM bits 105:103
   are programmed with “011” or “110,” this 3-bit field will permanently disable the VPP charge pump and will not
   allow further writes to the EEPROM. See Table 2.3 in section 2.6 for more information.
   2.6.2.       Sensor Connection Check
   Four dedicated comparators permanently check the range of the bridge inputs (BP/BN) to ensure they are within
   the envelope of 0.8V to 0.85VDD during all conversions. The two sensor inputs have a switched ohmic path to
   ground and if left floating, would be discharged. If any of the wires connecting the bridge break, this mechanism
   will detect it and put the ZSC31015 in a diagnostic state. This same diagnostic feature can also detect a short
   between BP/BN and the ExtTemp signal if an external diode is being used for temperature measurement. See
   Table 2.3 in section 2.6 for more information.
   †
     A short from ExtTemp to BP/BN might not be detected in some circuit configurations.

                                                                                                       ZSC31015 Datasheet
   2.6.3.     Sensor Short Check
   If a short occurs between BP/BN (bridge inputs), it would normally produce an in-range output signal and there-
   fore would not be detected as a fault. This diagnostic mode, if enabled, will deliberately look for such a short. After
   the measurement cycle of the bridge, it will deliberately pull the BP bridge input to ground for 4sec. At the end of
   this 4sec window, it will check to see if the BN input “followed” it down below the 0.8V comparator checkpoint. If
   so, a short must exist between BP/BN, and the part will output a diagnostic state. The bridge will have a minimum
   of 480sec recovery time prior to the next measurement. See Table 2.3 in section 2.6 for more information.
   The bridge resistance must be taken into account if the Sensor Short diagnostic feature is used. At VDD= 2.7V, the
   minimum bridge resistance is 0.3Kand at VDD = 5V, the minimum bridge resistance is 0.6K.
   2.6.4.     Power Loss Detection
   If the power or GND connection to the module containing the sensor bridge and the ZSC31015 is lost, the
   ZSC31015 will output a diagnostic state if a pull-up or pull-down terminating resistor greater than or equal to 5k
   is connected in the final application. This diagnostic mode only works when the part is configured in Analog
   Output Mode. See Table 2.3 in section 2.6 for more information.
   2.6.5.     ExtTemp Connection Checks
   When external temperature is selected and connection checking is enabled, the part performs range checking on
   the converted temperature value. If the internal ADC reading of the temperature is less than 1/32 of full scale or
   greater than 63/64 of full scale then a diagnostic state is asserted. If the ExtTemp pin is shorted to ground, the
   ADC reads less than 1/32. Because 100µA is sourced onto the ExtTemp pin during conversions, it naturally pulls
   up during these times. If the ExtTemp pin is open, it produces an ADC reading greater than 63/64 of full scale.
   Both these bad connection conditions would be detected and result in a diagnostic output. If internal temperature
   is selected or sensor connection check is not enabled, then this diagnostic check is not enabled. See Table 2.3 in
   section 2.6 for more information.

   3          Functional Description
   3.1.       General Working Mode
   The command/data transfer takes place via the one-wire SIG™ pin using the ZACwireTM serial communication
   protocol.
   After power-on, the ZSC31015 waits for 3ms (= Command window) for the Start_CM command.
   Without this command, the Normal Operation Mode (NOM) starts. In this mode, raw bridge values are converted,
   and the corrected values are presented on the output in analog or digital format (depending on the configuration
   stored in EEPROM).
   Command Mode (CM) can only be entered during the 3ms command window after power-on. If the ZSC31015
   receives the Start_CM command during the command window, it remains in the Command Mode. The CM allows
   changing to one of the other modes via command. After the command Start_RW, the ZSC31015 is in the Raw
   Mode (RM). Without correction, the raw values are transmitted to the digital output in a predefined order. The RM
   can only be stopped by a power-off. RM is used by the calibration software for collection of raw bridge and
   temperature data so the correction coefficients can be calculated.
   If diagnostic features are enabled and a diagnostic fault is detected, diagnostic states are indicated as follows
   depending on the programmed mode:
           In Analog Output Mode,
            diagnostic states are indicated by an output below 2.5% of VDD or above 97.5% of VDD.
           In Digital Output Mode,
            diagnostic states will be indicated by a transmission with a generated parity error.

   The incoming serial signal will be sampled at a 512 kHz clock rate. This protocol is very tolerant to clock skew,
   and can easily tolerate baud rates in the 6 kHz to 48 kHz range.

   The incoming frame will be checked for proper parity on both, command and data bytes, as well as for any edge
   time-outs prior to a full frame being received.
   Once a command/data pair is received, the ZSC31015 will perform that command. After the command has been
   successfully executed by the ZSC31015, it will acknowledge success by a transmission of an A5HEX-byte back to
   the master. If the master does not receive an A5HEX transmission within 130 ms of issuing the command, it must
   assume the command was either improperly received or could not be executed.

   The ZSC31015 transmits 10-bit bytes (1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 parity bit). During calibration and configuration,
   transmissions are normally either A5HEX or data. A5HEX indicates successful completion of a command. There are
   two different digital output modes configurable (digital output with temperature, and digital output with only bridge
   data). During Normal Operation Mode, if the part is configured for digital output of the bridge reading, it first
   transmits the high byte of bridge data, followed by the low byte. The bridge data is 14 bits in resolution, so the
   upper two bits of the high byte are always zero-padded. There is a half stop bit time between bytes in a packet.
   This means that for the time of a half a bit width, the signal level is high.

   The second option for Digital Output Mode is digital output bridge reading with temperature. It will be transmitted
   as 3 data packets. The temperature byte represents an 8-bit temperature quantity spanning from -50 to 150°C.

   Transmissions from the IC occur at one of two speeds depending on the update rate programmed in EEPROM. If
   the user chooses one of the two fastest update rates (1 ms or 5 ms) then the baud rate of the digital transmission
   will be 32 kHz (minimum 26kHz). If, however, the user chooses one of the two slower update rates (25 ms or
   125 ms), then the baud rate of the digital transmission will be 8 kHz (maximum 9.6kHz).
   The total transmission time for both digital output configurations is shown in Table 3.3.

   The temperature raw reading is performed less often than a bridge reading because the temperature changes
   more slowly.
   The 3rd column in Table 3.2 shows the timing for the special measurements (temperature and bridge
   measurement) in the different update rate modes.
   For lower update rates, the output is followed by a power-down as shown in Figure 3.9.

   It is easy to program any standard microcontroller to communicate with the ZSC31015. IDT can provide sample
   code for a MicroChip PIC microcontroller.
   3.2.5.       High Level Protocol
   The ZSC31015 will listen for a command/data pair to be transmitted for the 3 ms after the de-assertion of its
   internal Power On Reset (POR). If a transmission is not received within this time frame, then it will transition to
   Normal Operation Mode (NOM). In the NOM, it will output bridge data in 0-1V analog, rail-to-rail ratiometric
   analog, or digital depending on how the part is currently configured.
   If the ZSC31015 receives a Start_CM command within the first 3 ms after the de-assertion of POR, then it will go
   into Command Mode (CM). In this mode, calibration/configuration commands will be executed. The ZSC31015
   will acknowledge successful execution of commands by transmission of A5HEX. The calibrating /configuring master
   will know a command was not successfully executed if no response is received after 130ms of issuing the
   command. Once in command interpreting/executing mode, the ZSC31015 will stay in this mode until power is
   removed or a Start NOM (Start Normal Operation Mode) command is received. The Start_CM command is used
   as an interlock mechanism to prevent a spurious entry into Command Mode on power up. The first command
   received within the 3ms window of POR must be a Start_CM command to enter into command interpreting mode.
   Any other commands will be ignored.

   3.4.       Calibration Sequence
   Although the ZSC31015 can work with many different types of resistive bridges, assume a pressure bridge is
   being used for the following discussion on calibration.
   Calibration essentially involves collecting raw bridge and temperature data from the ZSC31015 for different known
   pressures and temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the calibration master (typically a PC) to
   compute the coefficients, and the calculated coefficients can then be written to the ZSC31015.
   IDT can provide software and hardware with samples to perform the calibration.
   There are three main steps to calibration:
       1.    Assigning a unique identification to the ZSC31015. This identification is programmed in EEPROM and
            can be used as an index into the database stored on the calibration PC. This database will contain all the
            raw values of bridge readings and temperature readings for that part, as well as the known pressure (for
            this application) and temperature the bridge was exposed to. This unique identification can be stored in a
            concatenation of the following EEPROM registers: Cust_ID0, Cust_ID1, Cust_ID2. These registers can
            also form a permanent serial number.
       2. Data collection. Data collection involves getting raw data from the bridge at different known pressures and
            temperatures. This data is then stored on the calibration PC using the unique identification of the
            ZSC31015 as the index to the database.
       3. Coefficient calculation and write. Once enough data points have been collected to calculate all the
            desired coefficients then the coefficients can be calculated by the calibrating PC and written to the
            ZSC31015.

                                                                                                      ZSC31015 Datasheet
   Step 1 – Assigning Unique Identification
   Assigning a unique identification number is as simple as using the commands Program Cust_ID0, Program
   Cust_ID1 and Program Cust_ID2. These three 8-bit registers allow for more than 16 million unique devices.
   Gain_B must be programmed to 800HEX (unity) and Gain_T must be programmed to 80HEX (unity).
   Step 2 – Data Collection
   The number of unique (pressure, temperature) points that calibration must be performed at depends on the user’s
   needs. The minimum is a 2-point calibration, and the maximum is a 5-point calibration. To acquire raw data from
   the part, set the ZSC31015 to enter Raw Mode. This is done by issuing a Start_CM (Start Command Mode
   5090HEX) command/data pair to the ZSC31015 followed by a Start_RM (Start Raw Mode 4010HEX) command/data
   pair with the LSB of the upper data nibble set. Now if the Gain_B term has been set to unity (800 HEX) and the
   Gain_T term has also been set to unity (80HEX), then the part will be in the Raw Mode and will output raw data on
   its SIGTM pin instead of corrected bridge and temperature. Capture several of these data points with the user’s
   calibration system (16 each of bridge and temperature is recommended) and average them. Store these raw
   bridge and temperature settings in the database along with the known pressure and temperature.
   The output format during Raw Mode is Bridge_High, Bridge_Low, Temp. Each of these is an 8-bit quantity. The
   upper 2-bits of Bridge_High are zero-filled. The Temp data (8-bits only) would not be enough information for
   accurate temperature calibration. Therefore the upper three bits of temperature information are not given, but
   rather assumed known. Therefore effectively 11-bits of temperature information are provided in this mode.
   Step 3 – Coefficient Calculations
   The math to perform the coefficient calculation is very complicated and will not be discussed in detail. There is a
   rough overview in section 3.6. IDT will provide software to perform the coefficient calculation. IDT can also
   provide source code for the algorithms in a C code format. After the coefficients are calculated, the final step is to
   write them to the EEPROM of the ZSC31015.
   The number of calibration points required can be as few as two or as many as five. This depends on the precision
   desired and the behavior of the resistive bridge in use.
        1. 2-point calibration can be used if only a gain and offset term are needed for a bridge with no temperature
            compensation for either term.
        2. 3-point calibration would be used to obtain 1st order compensation for either a Tco or Tcg term but not
            both.
        3. 3-point calibration could also be used to obtain 2nd order correction for the bridge but no temperature
            compensation of the bridge output.
        4. 4-point calibration would be used to obtain 1st order compensation for both Tco and Tcg.
        5. 4-point calibration could also be used to obtain 1st order compensation for Tco and a 2nd order correction
            for the bridge measurement.
        6. 5-point calibration would be used to obtain both 1st order Tco correction and 1st order Tcg correction, plus
            a 2nd order correction that could be applied to one and only one of the following: 2nd order Tco, 2nd order
            Tcg, or 2nd order bridge.

        Offset_T      Offset term used to compensate offset of Temp reading
          SOT         Second Order Term. The SOT can be applied as a second order correction term for one of the following:
                         - Bridge measurement
                         - Temperature coefficient of offset (Tco)
                         - Temperature coefficient of gain (Tcg)
                      The EEPROM bits 99:98 determine what SOT applies to.

                      (Tc_cfg[2].
          Tco         Temperature correction coefficient of bridge offset term. This term has an 8-bit magnitude, a sign bit
                      (Tc_cfg[0]), and a scaling bit (Tc_cfg[1]), which can multiply its magnitude by 8.
   3.6.2.     Interpretation of Binary Numbers for Correction Coefficients
   BR_Raw should be interpreted as an unsigned number in the set [0, 16383] with a resolution of 1.
   T_Raw should be interpreted as an unsigned number in the set [0, 16383], with a resolution of 4.

   3.6.2.1. Gain_B Interpretation
   Gain_B should be interpreted as a number in the set [0, 64]. The MSB (bit 14) is a scaling bit that will multiply the
   effect of the Gain_B[13:0] term by 8. The remaining bits Gain_B[13:0] represent a number in the range of [0,8)
   with Gain_B[13] having a weighting of 4, and each subsequent bit has a weighting of ½ the previous bit.

   3.6.2.5. Tco Interpretation
   Tco is specified as having an 8-bit magnitude with an additional sign bit and a scalar bit (Tc_cfg). When the scalar
   bit is set, the signed Tco is multiplied by 8.
         Tco Resolution:      0.175 μV/V/oC             (input referred)
         Tco Range:           ± 44.6 μV/V/oC            (input referred)
   If the scaling bit is used, then the above resolution and range are scaled by 8 to give the following results:
         Tco Scaled Resolution:        1.40 μV/V/oC (input referred)
         Tco Scaled Range:             ± 357 μV/V/oC (input referred)
   3.6.2.6. Tcg Interpretation
   Tcg is specified as an 8-bit magnitude with an additional sign bit (Tc_cfg).
         Tcg Resolution:      17.0 ppm/oC
         Tcg Range:           ±4335 ppm/oC
   3.6.2.7. SOT Interpretation
   SOT is a 2nd order term that can apply to one and only one of the following: bridge non-linearity correction,
   Tco non-linearity correction, or Tcg non-linearity correction.
   As it applies to bridge non-linearity correction:
         Resolution: 0.25% @ full scale
         Range:          +25% @ full scale to -25% @ full scale
           (Saturation in internal arithmetic will occur at greater negative nonlinearities.)
   As it applies to Tcg:
         Resolution: 0.3 ppm/(oC)2
         Range:          +/- 38ppm/(oC)2
   As it applies to Tco:
       2 settings are possible. It is possible to scale the effect of SOT by 8. If Tc_cfg[1] is set, then both Tco and
       SOT’s contribution to Tco are multiplied by 8.
         Resolution at unity scaling: 1.51nV/V/(oC)2 (input referred)
         Range: +/- 0.192V/V/(oC)2 (input referred)
         Resolution at 8x scaling: 12.1nV/V/(oC)2 (input referred)
         Range: +/- 1.54V/V/(oC)2 (input referred)

   4          Application Circuit Examples
   The minimum output analog load resistor is RL= 5k. This optional load resistor can be configured as a pull-up or
   pull-down. If it is configured as a pull-down, it cannot be part of the module to be calibrated because this would
   prevent proper operation of the ZACwireTM. If a pull-down load is desired, it must be added to system after module
   calibration.
   There is no output load capacitance needed.
   EEPROM contents: OUTPUT_select, Config_JFET_Regulation, 1V_Trim/JFET-Trim.

   4.4.       Digital Output
   For all three circuits, the output signal can also be digital. Depending on the output select bits, the bridge signal or
   the bridge signal and temperature signal are sent. For the digital output, no load resistor or load capacity is
   necessary. No pull down resistor is allowed. If a line resistor or pull-up resistor is used, the requirement for the
   rise time must be met (< 5 s). The ZSC31015 output includes an internal pull up resistor of about 30 k. The
   digital output can easily be read by firmware from a microcontroller, and IDT can provide the customer with
   software for developing the interface.
   4.5.       Output Resistor/Capacitor Limits
   The limits for external components depend on the programmed output mode:
       Pure Analog Output Mode (calibration is done before): The only limit is the minimum load resistance of 5 k.
       Pure Digital Output Mode with end-of-line calibration: The RC time constant of the ZACwire™ line must have
        a rise time < 5 µs.
       Analog output with digital communication during calibration: The RC time constant of the ZACwire™ line must
        have a rise time < 5 µs.
   Warning: Any series line resistance forms a voltage divider in conjunction with the pull-up load device. If a series
   line resistance is needed, choose a low value relative to the pull-up load device.

                                                                                                    ZSC31015 Datasheet
   5          EEPROM Restoration
   If needed, the default settings for the ZSC31015 (see Table 3.5) can be reprogrammed as described in section 3.
   The following sections describe EEPROM content validation and handling during and/or after system assembly.
   Important: During the sawing and dicing process, there is a possibility of the EEPROM contents flipping, and
   prevention cannot be guaranteed. This is primarily a concern for the factory trim settings, which are customized to
   each part.
   The EEPROM default values programmed during the different test levels have been selected so that customer
   has the option to refresh/reprogram trim bits that might have flipped during sawing or dicing.
   Important: The EEPROM lock is stored in the bit range 105:103. A value of 6HEX or 3HEX will lock the EEPROM
   forever by disabling the charge pump needed for EEPROM writing. The complete contents can also be validated
   using the EEPROM signature stored in bits [151:144], (see “Signature” in Table 3.5).
   5.1.       Default EEPROM Contents
   During the wafer level test (wafer/dice delivery) and during final test for SOP8 packaged parts, the EEPROM is
   programmed with the default values listed in the Table 3.5. During the wafer level test, the Osc_trim bits [2:0] and
   1V_Trim/JFET_Trim trim bits [6:3] are set to die-specific values.
   5.1.1.     Osc_Trim
   The oscillator frequency is trimmed to a value of 512kHz±20% using the Osc_Trim bit setting. The 3-bit setting is
   copied twice to Cust_ID1[134:132] and [130:128] and then a third time to Cust_ID2[138:136] to ensure the factory
   settings are retained so that the customer can reprogram these values in the Osc_Trim bit if needed. Based on
   the most probable trimming, the default values for the Osc_Trim bits are always set to 0HEX during factory testing
   to guarantee communication even if bits have flipped.
   5.1.2.     1V_Trim/JFET_Trim
   The 5V reference for the JFET regulation is factory trimmed during the final test to 5V±15mV using the 1V_Trim/
   JFET_Trim bit setting. The 4-bit setting stored in EEPROM bits [6:3] is copied twice to the Cust_ID0 bits [127:124]
   and [123:120] to ensure the factory settings are retained so that the customer can reprogram these values in the
   1V_Trim/JFET_Trim bits if needed.
   5.2.       EEPROM Restoration Procedure
   After module assembly, the EEPROM content should be refreshed. If JFET regulation is not used for the user’s
   application and optimized response time is not an important criterion, write the default values shown in Table 3.5
   to the EEPROM bit range [143:7] and retain the existing values in the bit range [6:0]. If JFET regulation or
   optimized response time is required, the bit restoration procedure shown in the flow chart in Figure 5.1 must be
   used to keep the factory settings programmed during the testing. If customer oscillator trimming is required, see
   ZSC31015_Tech_Notes_JFET_and_Osc_Trimming_revX.X .pdf for instructions.)
   Note: The EEPROM signature is re-calculated and updated after every EEPROM writing.
