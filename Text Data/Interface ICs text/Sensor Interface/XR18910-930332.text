Application Information (Continued)
Typical Application – 8:1 Bridge Sensor Interface
The XR18910 was designed to interface multiple bridge sensors with a microcontroller or FPGA as illustrated in Figure 25.
The bridge output signal is differential (VO+ and VO-). Ideally, the unloaded bridge output is zero (VO+ and VO- are identical).
However, in-exact resistive values result in a difference between VO+ and VO-. This bridge offset voltage can be substantial
and vary between sensors. The XR18910 provides the ability to calibrate the bridge offset on each of the 8 bridge sensors
using the on-board DAC.

Layout Considerations
General layout and supply bypassing play major roles in high frequency performance. Follow the steps below as a basis for
high frequency layout:
■■ Include 6.8µF and 0.1µF ceramic capacitors for power supply decoupling
■■ Place the 6.8µF capacitor within 0.75 inches of the power pin
■■ Place the 0.1µF capacitor within 0.1 inches of the power pin
■■ Connection to the exposed pad is not required. Exposed pad can be connected to ground (GND).
■■ Minimize all trace lengths to reduce series inductances
