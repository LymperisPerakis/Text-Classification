Note  2:  All voltages are referenced to GND. Currents entering the IC are specified positive, and currents exiting the IC are negative.
Note  3:  Guaranteed by design; not production tested.
Note  4:  Not including cold-junction temperature error or thermocouple nonlinearity.
Note  5:  Specification is 100% tested at TA = +25°C. Specification limits over temperature (TA = TMIN to TMAX) are guaranteed by
          design and characterization; not production tested.
Note 6: Because the thermocouple temperature conversions begin at VPOR, depending on VCC slew rates, the first thermocouple
          temperature conversion may not produce an accurate result. Therefore, the tCONV_PU specification is required after VCC is
          greater than VCCMIN to guarantee a valid thermocouple temperature conversion result.
Note 7: For all pins except T+ and T- (see the Thermocouple Input Bias Current parameter in the DC Electrical Characteristics
          table).
