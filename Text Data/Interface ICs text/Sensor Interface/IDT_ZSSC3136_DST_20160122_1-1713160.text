2            Circuit Description
2.1.    Signal Flow
The ZSSC3136’s signal path is partly analog and partly digital. The analog section is differential – this means the
differential bridge sensor signal is internally handled via two signal lines that are rejected symmetrically around an
internal common mode potential (analog ground = VDDA/2).
As a result of the differential design, it is possible to amplify positive and negative input signals that are within the
common mode range of the signal input.

The differential signal from the bridge sensor is pre-amplified by the programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The
multiplexer (MUX) transmits the signals from either the bridge sensor or the internal or external temperature
sensor to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in a specific sequence. The ADC converts these signals into
digital values.

                                                                                                             ZSSC3136 Datasheet
The digital signal conditioning is processed by the calibration microcontroller (CMC). It is based on a correction
formula that uses sensor-specific coefficients determined during calibration. The formula is located in ROM, and
the sensor-specific coefficients are stored in EEPROM. Depending on the programmed output configuration, the
conditioned sensor signal is output as an analog signal, or alternatively can be readout via a digital serial interface
(I²C™ or ZACwire™). The configuration data and the correction parameters must also be programmed into the
EEPROM via the digital interfaces.
2.2.      Application Modes
For each application, a configuration set must be established by programming the on-chip EEPROM for the
following modes:
    •    Sensor channel
          Input range: The gain adjustment of the analog front-end (AFE) with respect to the maximum sensor
           signal span and the zero point of the A/D conversion must be selected.
          Resolution/response time: The A/D converter must be configured for resolution. These settings influence
           the sampling rate and the signal integration time, and thus, the noise immunity.
    •    Temperature
          Temperature measurement: Select the internal or external temperature sensor.
2.3.      Analog Front-End (AFE)
The analog front-end (AFE) consists of the three-stage programmable gain amplifier (PGA), the multiplexer
(MUX), and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

2.3.2.         Offset Compensation
The ZSSC3136 processes a sensor-offset correction during the digital signal conditioning by the calibration
microcontroller (CMC).
2.3.3.         Measurement Cycle
The measurement cycle is controlled by the CMC. Depending on EEPROM settings, the multiplexer (MUX)
selects the following input signals in a defined sequence:
    •    Pre-amplified bridge sensor signal
    •    Temperature sensor signal
    •    Internal offset of the input channel (VOFF)
The cycle diagram in Figure 2.2 shows the basic structure of the measurement cycle. After power-on, the startup
routine is processed, which performs all required measurements to expedite acquiring an initial valid conditioned
sensor output. After the startup routine, the normal measurement cycle runs.

2.3.4.     Analog-to-Digital Converter
The A/D converter is implemented using full-differential switched-capacitor technique.
Programmable ADC resolutions are rADC=<13, 14>bit.
The A/D conversion is integrating, inherently monotone, and insensitive to short and long term instability of the
clock frequency. The conversion time tADC depends on the desired resolution and can be roughly calculated by
equation (1):
                2 rADC
     t ADC =
               fOSC                                                                                              (1)
                      
               2 
Where
     rADC           Resolution of A/D conversion
     fOSC           Frequency of internal oscillator (refer to 1.3.1)
Refer to the ZSSC313x Bandwidth Calculation Sheet for a detailed calculation of sampling time and bandwidth.
The result of the A/D conversion is a relative counter result Z corresponding to the following equation:
                   VADC_DIFF
     Z = 2rADC ⋅ (           − RS)                                                                                 (2)
                   VADC_REF
Where
         rADC              Resolution of A/D conversion
         VADC_DIFF         Differential ADC input voltage
         VADC_REF          ADC reference voltage (VVBR_T-VVBR_B or VVDDA-VVSSA, if BRREF=1)
         RS                Digital ADC Range Shift (RS = 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2; controlled by the EEPROM contents)
With the RS value, a sensor input signal can be shifted in the optimal input range of the ADC.
The condition required for ensuring the specified accuracy, stability, and non-linearity parameters of the analog
front-end is that the differential ADC input voltage VADC_DIFF does not exceed the range of 10% to 90% of the ADC
reference voltage VADC_REF. This requirement must be met for the whole temperature range and for all sensor
tolerances.

      1)    Output resolution does not exceed ADC resolution. PGA gain should be such that the differential ADC input signal uses at least 50% of ADC input
            range to ensure maximum achievable output resolution.
      2)    Refer to the ZSSC313x Bandwidth Calculation Spreadsheet for a detailed calculation of sampling time and bandwidth.
2.4.      Temperature Measurement
The ZSSC3136 supports different methods for acquiring temperature data needed for conditioning of the sensor
signal. Temperature data can be acquired using
    •    an internal pn-junction temperature sensor,
    •    an external pn-junction temperature sensor connected to the sensor top potential (VBR_T) or
    •    an external resistive half bridge temperature sensor.
Refer to the ZSSC313x Functional Description for a detailed explanation of temperature sensor adaptation and
adjustment.
2.5.      System Control and Conditioning Calculation
The system control supports the following tasks/features:
    •    Managing the startup sequence
    •    Controlling the measurement cycle regarding to the EEPROM-stored configuration data
    •    Sensor signal conditioning (calculation of the 16-bit correction for each measurement signal using the
         EEPROM-stored conditioning coefficients and the ROM-based formulas)
    •    Processing communication requests received via the digital interfaces
    •    Performing failsafe tasks and message detected errors by setting diagnostic states
2.5.1.       General Working Modes
ZSSC3136 supports three different working modes:
    •    Normal Operation Mode (NOM) – for continuous processing of signal conditioning
    •    Command Mode (CM) – for calibration and access to all internal registers
    •    Diagnostic Mode (DM) – for failure messages

                                                                                                                         ZSSC3136 Datasheet
                                 1
2.5.2.       Startup Phase
After power-on, the startup phase is processed, which includes
    •    Internal supply voltage settling including reset of the circuitry by the power-on reset block (POR).
         Refer to the ZSSC313x Technical Note—High Voltage Protection for power-on/off thresholds.
         Duration (beginning with VVDDA-VVSSA=0V): 500µs to 2ms; AOUT: high impedance.
    •    System start and configuration, EEPROM readout, and signature check.
         Duration: ~200µs; AOUT: lower diagnostic range (LDR).
    •    ROM check, if CFGAPP:CHKROM=1.
         Duration: ~10ms; AOUT: lower diagnostic range (LDR).
    •    Processing the measurement cycle start routine.
         Duration: 5x A/D conversion time; AOUT behavior depends on configured one-wire communication mode
         (refer to section 2.6):
                     OWIANA or OWIDIS  AOUT: lower diagnostic range (LDR)
                     OWIWIN or OWIENA  AOUT: tri-state
If an error is detected during the startup phase, the Diagnostic Mode (DM) is activated and the analog output at
the AOUT pin remains in the lower diagnostic range.
After the startup phase, the continuous running measurement and sensor signal conditioning cycle is started, and
analog or digital output of the conditioned sensor signal is activated. If the one-wire communication mode
OWIWIN is selected, the OWI startup window expires before analog output is available.
2.5.3.       Conditioning Calculation
The digitalized value for the bridge signal is processed with a conditioning formula to remove offset and
                                                                                  rd
temperature dependency and to compensate nonlinearity up to 3 order. The result is a non-negative 15-bit value
for the measured bridge sensor signal in the range [0; 1). This value is available for readout via I²C or OWI
communication. For the analog output, the value is clipped to the programmed output limits.
Note:          The extent of signal deviation that can be compensated by the conditioning calculation depends on the
               specific sensor signal characteristics. For a rough estimation, assume the following: offset
               compensation and gain correction are not limited. Notice that resolution of the digitally gained signal is
               determined by the ADC resolution in respect to the dynamic input range used. The temperature
               correction includes first and second order terms and should be adequate for all practically relevant
               cases. The non-linearity correction of the sensor signal is possible for second-order up to about
               30% FS regarding ideal fit and for third-order up to about 20% FS. Overall, the conditioning formula
               applied is able to reduce the non-linearity of the sensor signal by a factor of 10.

   All timing values are roughly estimated for an oscillator frequency fOSC=3MHz and are proportional to that frequency.

                                                                                                  ZSSC3136 Datasheet
2.6.    Analog or Digital Output
The AOUT pin is used for analog output and for one-wire communication (OWI). The latter can be used for digital
readout of the conditioned sensor signal and for end-of-line sensor module calibration. The ZSSC3136 supports
different modes for the analog output in interaction with OWI communication:
    •  OWIENA:        Analog output is deactivated; OWI readout of the signal data is enabled.
    •  OWIWIN:        Analog output starts after the startup phase and after the OWI startup window if OWI
                      communication is not initiated; OWI communication for configuration or for end-of-line
                      calibration can be started during the OWI startup window (maximum ~500ms) by sending the
                      START_CM command.
    •  OWIANA:        Analog output starts after the startup phase; OWI communication for configuration or for end-
                      of-line calibration can be started during the OWI startup window (maximum ~500ms) by
                      sending the START_CM command; for command transmission, the driven analog output at
                      the AOUT pin must be overwritten by the external communication master (AOUT drive
                      capability is current-limited).
    •  OWIDIS:        Analog output starts after the startup phase; OWI readout of the signal data is disabled.
The analog output signal is driven by an offset compensated, rail-to-rail output buffer that is current-limited to
prevent damage to the ZSSC3136 from a short circuit between the analog output and power supply or ground.
Output resolution of at least 12-bit in the range of 10% to 90% FS is ensured by a 12.4-bit resistor string DAC.
2.7.    Serial Digital Interface
                                                 TM                         TM
The ZSSC3136 includes a serial digital I²C interface and a ZACwire interface for one-wire communication
(OWI). The digital interfaces allow configuration and calibration of the sensor module. OWI communication can be
used to perform an end-of-line calibration via the analog output pin AOUT of a completely assembled sensor
module. The interfaces also provide the readout of the conditioned sensor signal data during normal operation.
Refer to the ZSSC313x Functional Description for a detailed description of the serial interfaces and the
communication protocols.
2.8.    Failsafe Features
The ZSSC3136 detects various failures. When a failure is detected, Diagnostic Mode (DM) is activated. DM is
indicated by setting the output pin AOUT to the Lower Diagnostic Range (LDR). When using digital serial
communication protocols (I²C™ or OWI) to read conditioning results data, the error status is indicated by a
specific error code.
A watchdog timer controls the proper operation of the microcontroller. The operation of the internal oscillator is
monitored by an oscillator-failure detection circuit. EEPROM and RAM content are checked when accessed.
Control registers are parity protected.
The sensor connection is checked with regard to broken wires or short circuits (sensor connection check, sensor
short check).
The connection of an external temperature sensor can be monitored by the temperature sensor check.
In addition to these checks, the ZSSC3136, which is optimized for failsafe switch applications, also provides a

indication.
2.9.     High Voltage, Reverse Polarity, and Short Circuit Protection
The ZSSC3136 is designed for 5V power supply operation.
The ZSSC3136 and the connected sensor are protected from overvoltage and reverse polarity damage by an
internal supply voltage limiter. The analog output AOUT can be connected (short circuit, overvoltage, and reverse
polarity) with all potentials in the protection range under all potential conditions at the pins VDDE and VSSE.
To guarantee this operation, all external components (see application circuit in section 3) are required. The
protection is not time-limited.
Refer to the ZSSC313x Technical Note—High Voltage Protection for a detailed description of protection cases
and conditions.
