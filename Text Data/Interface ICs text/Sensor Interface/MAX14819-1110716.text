 The TxRxDataA register allows writing data into the channel A TxFIFOA and reading data received out of the channel
 A RxFIFOA. Data can be written into the TxFIFOA and read out of the RxFIFOA in either byte-by-byte mode or burst
 mode. When using SPI burst mode, multiple bytes can be written to/read from the FIFOs in a single SPI cycle. Reading
 the RxFIFOA after it is empty results in random values.
 RxFIFOA and TxFIFOA are available when framer A is enabled by setting the FramerEnA bit in the ChanStatA register.

 The RxFIFOLvlA register shows the current number of device message bytes in the RxFIFOA. This changes as data is read out of
 the RxFIFOA and as the RxFIFOA fills up. The MAX14819 adds one byte, at the start of the RxFIFOA data, which is the number of
 device message bytes that were received; the RxFIFOLvlA value does not include this added byte.
 Note: Due to the limitations of simultaneous access, the value read from the RxFIFOLvlA register may be off by ±1 word while the
 receiver is receiving data. The value read from RxFIFOLvlA is correct while the receiver is not receiving data.

          BIT              NAME                                       DESCRIPTION
                                     Channel A Establish-Communication Sequence Enable
                                     Set the EstComA to 1 to initiate an IO-Link establish-communication se-
                                     quence on CQA. After successful completion of the establish
                                     communication sequence, a WURQInt interrupt is generated and the
                                     EstComA bit changes to 0. During the generated wake-up pulse, the CQA
                                     current limit is temporarily set above 500mA internally, although the CL_
            5             EstComA
                                     register bits are not changed. The COM rate of the IO-Link device is then
                                     reflected by the ComRt0A and ComRt1A bits and the device cycle time
                                     can be read out of the CyclTimeA register.
                                     If the establish-communication sequence was not successful, a WURQInt
                                     interrupt is generated and EstComA is 0 and the ComRt1A and ComRt0A
                                     bits both = 0. The FramerEnA bit must be 1 to use the EstComA function.
                                     Channel A Wake-Up Pulse Generate
                                     Set WuPulsA to 1 to immediately generate a wake-up pulse/request
                                     (WURQ) on CQA. Following the wake-up request, the CQA transceiver is
            4             WuPulsA
                                     set into receive mode. WuPulsA is reset to 0 after the WURQ is completed.
                                     WuPulsA is used when the microcontroller manages the establish
                                     communication sequence and the EstComA funciton is not used.
                                     Channel A TX FIFO (TxFIFOA) Reset
                                     Set TxFifoRstA to reset the TxFIFOA. This may be necessary if an SPI
            3            TxFifoRstA
                                     transmission error is detected when filling the TxFIFOA or if a CQA
                                     transmission error is detected.
                                     Channel A RX FIFO (RxFIFOA) Reset
            2            RxFifoRstA  Set RxFifoRstA to reset the RxFIFOA. This may be necessary if an
                                     RSizeErrA event occurs.
                                     Channel A Cycle Timer Enable
                                     Set CyclTmrEnA to 1 to enable the channel A cycle time. CyclTmrEnA
                                     does not start the cycle timer. Cycle timer A starts when the CQSendA bit
            1           CycleTmrEnA  is set to 1 (after the timer is enabled) or an associated trigger command is
                                     received.
                                     Set CyclTmrEnA to 0 to stop the cycle timer. The timer can be stopped at
                                     any time, even if the current cycle is not yet complete.
                                     Channel A Initiate Master Message
                                     Set CQSendA to 1 to initiate transmission of the master message in the
                                     channel A transmit FIFO (TxFIFOA). The CQA transceiver is put into
                                     transmit mode and sends the master message/data in the TxFIFOA. When
            0            CQSendA     the master message is complete/TxFIFOA is empty, the CQA transceiver
                                     is set to receive mode to receive device messages.
                                     If CyclTmrEnA = 1, setting CQSendA to 1 also starts cycle timer A.
                                     CQSendA is automatically cleared.

           2                     RxFifoRstB         Set RxFifoRstA to reset the RxFIFOA. This may be necessary if
                                                    an RSizeErrA event occurs.
                                                    Channel B Cycle Timer Enable
                                                    Set CyclTmrEnB to 1 to enable the channel B cycle time.
                                                    CyclTmrEnB does not start the cycle timer. Cycle timer B starts
           1                     CyclTmrEnB         when the CQSendB bit is set to 1 (after the timer is enabled) or an
                                                    associated trigger command is received.
                                                    Set CyclTmrEnB to 0 to stop the cycle timer. The timer can be
                                                    stopped at any time, even if the current cycle is not yet complete.
                                                    Channel B Initiate Master Message
                                                    Set CQSendB to 1 to initiate transmission of the master message
                                                    in the channel B transmit FIFO (TxFIFOB). The CQB transceiver
                                                    is put into transmit mode and sends the master message/data in
                                                    the TxFIFOB. When the master message is complete/TxFIFOB
           0                      CQSendB
                                                    is empty, the CQB transceiver is set to receive mode to receive
                                                    device messages.
                                                    If CyclTmrEnB = 1, setting CQSendB to 1 also starts cycle timer

                                    Channel A Transmission Cycle Error
                                    This bit is set when when no data is loaded into the TxFIFOA before the start
                                    of the master message transmission. At least one octet must be loaded into
          6              TCyclErrA
                                    TxFIFOA at the start of the transmission cycle. This bit is only active when
                                    the internal cycle timer is used (CycTmrEnA = 1). The bit is cleared when the
                                    CQErrA register is read.
                                    Channel A Transmitter Checksum Error
                                    This bit is set when the checksum calculated by the MAX14819 on the master
                                    message is different to the checksum written in the TxFIFOA by the SPI
          5             TChksmErA   master. A checksum error indicates an SPI transmission error. This bit is only
                                    active when SPIChksA = 1. If TChksmErA = 1, the master message is not
                                    sent to the device when the autonomous cycle timer A is enabled. The bit is
                                    cleared when the CQErrA register is read.
                                    Channel A Transmitter Size Error
                                    This bit is set when the number of octets in the master message differs from the
                                    TxBytes value written into the TxFIFOA. This can occur as a result of
                                    slow SPI master writing of the master message into TxFIFOA while CQA
          4              TSizeErrA
                                    transmission has started, so that the master message cannot be sent in the al-
                                    located time. When this error occurs, it is recommended that the controller
                                    delete the TxFIFOA (TxFIFORstA = 1) and repeat the master message trans-
                                    mission. The bit is cleared when the CQErrA register is read.
                                    Channel A Receiver Checksum Error
                                    This bit is set when a 6-bit checksum calculated by the MAX14819 differs
          3             RChksmErA
                                    from the checksum in the received device message. The bit is cleared when
                                    the CQErrA register is read.
                                    Channel A Receiver Size Error
                                    This bit is set when the number of octets received for the device differs from
          2              RSizeErrA
                                    RxBytes previously loaded into TxFIFOA. The bit is cleared when the CQErrA
                                    register is read.
                                    Channel A Frame Error
                                    This bit is set when a UART frame error is detected on the data received on
          1             FrameErrA
                                    the CQA receiver. A FrameErrA error triggers a RxErrorA interrupt. The bit is
                                    cleared when the CQErrA register is read.
                                    Channel A Parity Error
                                    This bit is set when a UART parity error is detected on a word received by the
          0              ParityErrA
                                    CQA receiver. A ParityErrA interrupt triggers an RxErrorA interrupt in the Inter-
                                    rupt register. The bit is cleared when the CQErrA register is read.

                                                  loaded into TxFIFOB at the start of the transmission cycle. This bit is only
                                                  active when the internal cycle timer is used (CyclTmrEnB = 1). The bit is

            5                  TChksmErB          the SPI master. A checksum error indicates an SPI transmission error.
                                                  This bit is only active when SPIChksB = 1. If TChksmErB = 1, the master

                                                  This bit is set when the number of octects in the master message differs
                                                  from the TxBytes value written into the TxFIFOB. This can occur as a
                                                  result of slow SPI master writing of the master message into TxFIFOB

                                     Channel A L+ Dynamic Blanking Time Enable/Disable
                                     Set L+DynBLA = 1 to enable the blanking time reduction when the L+A
                                     voltage is below 18V. This option allows the circuit to reduce the energy
                                     dissipated in the external PMOS2 in case of a shorted output, keeping the
            5            L+DynBLA    current constant.
                                     The dynamic blanking time is limited, dependent on the L+ voltage:
                                         • Blanking time is reduced to 1/2 programmed time when
                                             9V (typ) ≤ VL+ ≤ 17V (typ)
                                         • Blanking time is reduced to 1/4 programmed time when
                                             VL+ < 9V (typ)
                                     Channel A L+ Sensor Supply Current Blanking Time
                                     Set the L+BLA[1:0] bits to set the current-limit blanking time for the L+A
                                     sensor supply:
                                       00: 5.5ms
                                       01: 16.5ms
                                       10: 55ms
                                       11: 165ms
           4:3          L+BLA[1:0]
                                     Longer blanking times allow for charging of larger capacitive loads.
                                     When selecting the blanking time, consider the power ratings of the
                                     external PMOS2 transistors used in the L+A supply line. The VDS on
                                     these transistors linearly reduces during capacitive load charge-up. The
                                     time to charge a capacitive load is proportional to the maximum current
                                     during blanking time.
                                     Channel A L+Double Current Limit Enable/Disable
                                     Set L+CL2xA = 1 to enable twice the current set by the current-limit
            2             L+CL2xA    resistor during the blanking time when the L+A voltage is higher than
                                     18V. Set L+CL2xA = 0 to operate the L+A sensor supply with the normal
                                     current-limit threshold.
                                     Channel A L+Supply Current Limit Enable/Disable
                                     Set L+CLimDisA = 1 to disable current limiting on the L+A sensor supply.
            1           L+CLimDisA   This disables the internal current-sense amplifier.
                                     Set L+CLimDisA = 0 to enable current limiting on L+A. The current limit is
                                     set by the sense resistor connected between the Channel A pMOSFETs.
                                     Channel A L+Supply Enable
                                     Set the L+EnA = 1 to enable the L+A sensor supply. This turns on the
                                     PMOS2 G2A gate driver.
            0              L+EnA     When L+EnA is set to 0, the current-limit timers (autoretry, latchoff, and
                                     blanking timers) are reset. Set L+EnA = 0 long enough to allow the
                                     external PMOS to cool, if needed.
                                     Short pulses on L+EnA (less than 200μs) are ignored.

                                             Channel B L+ Dynamic Blanking Time Enable/Disable
                                             Set L+DynBLB = 1 to enable the blanking time reduction when the L+B
                                             voltage is below 18V. This option allows the circuit to reduce the engery
                                             dissipated in the external PMOS2 in case of a shorted output, keeping the
            5                 L+DynBLB       current constant.
                                             The dynamic blanking time is limited, dependent on the L+ voltage:
                                                 • Blanking time is reduced to 1/2 programmed time when
                                                     9V (typ) ≤ VL+ ≤ 17V (typ)
                                                 • Blanking time is reduced to 1/4 programmed time when
                                                     VL+ < 9V (typ)
                                             Channel B L+ Sensor Supply Current Blanking Time
                                             Set the L+BLB[1:0] bits to set the current-limit blanking time for the L+B
                                             sensor supply:
                                               00: 5.5ms
                                               01: 16.5ms

                                             Longer blanking times allow for charging of larger capacitive loads.
                                             When selecting the blanking time, consider the power ratings of the
                                             external PMOS2 transistors used in the L+B supply line. The VDS on
                                             these transistors linearly reduces during capacitive load charge-up. The
                                             time to charge a capacitive load is proportional to the maximum current
                                             during blanking time.

                                     This disables the internal current-sense amplifier.

                                     Set L+CLimDisB = 0 to enabled current limiting on L+B. The current limit
                                     is set by the sense resistor connected between the Channel B
                                     pMOSFETs.

                                     blanking timers) are reset. Set L+EnB = 0 long enough to allow the
                                     external PMOS to cool, if needed.
                                     Short pulses on L+EnB (less than 200μs) are ignored.

                                              Set the CL[1:0] bits to set the current limit for the CQA and CQB drivers
                                              when CLDis = 0:

                                              CQA and CQB Driver Current Enable/Disable
                                              Set CLDis = 1 to disable current limiting on the CQA and CQB drivers.
            5                   CLDis         Set CLDis = 0 to enable current limiting on the CQA and CQB driver.
                                              When CLDis = 0, the CQA and CQB driver current limit is set by the
                                              CL[1:0] bits.
                                              Blanking Time Selection
                                              Set the CLBL[1:0] bits to set the blanking time on the CQA and CQB
                                              drivers before a fault is indicated:
                                                00: 128μs
                                                01: 500μs
           4:3                CLBL[1:0]         10: 1ms
                                                11: 5ms
                                              The blanking time affects the maximum capacitive and incandescent lamp
                                              load that can be driven without triggering the fault signal. In order to drive
                                              very large capacitive or lamp loads, increase the blanking time and/or
                                              disable the autoretry timeout.
                                              Autoretry Timeout Selection
                                              When a fault is detected on a driver output, the driver is disabled for the
                                              autoretry timeout. The driver is reenabled following the autoretry timeout.
                                              Set the TAr[1:0] bits to select the autoretry timeout:
           2:1                 TAr[1:0]
                                                00: 50ms
                                                01: 100ms
                                                10: 200ms
                                                11: 500ms
                                              Autoretry Enable/Disable
                                              Set ArEn = 1 to enable autoretry functionality when a fault condition occurs
                                              on CQA or CQB. When a fault is detected on a driver, the driver is disabled
                                              for the autoretry fixed off time (set in the TAr[1:0] bits). The driver is
            0                   ArEn
                                              reenabled and, following the blanking time, is rechecked. If the fault
                                              persists, the fault bit is left set and the driver is disabled again.
                                              When the fault is removed, the status bit is reset and the driver returns to
                                              normal operation.
