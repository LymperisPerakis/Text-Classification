 The Status register reflects the logic levels of DIO and shows the source of interrupts that DIOFault cause an IRQ hardware
 interrupt. The IRQ interrupt is asserted when an alarm condition (OTemp, UV33, UV24, DIOFault, DoFault, WuI) is detected. All
 bits in the Status register are read-only. The interrupt bits return to the default state after the Status register is read. If a DIO or
 DO fault condition persists, the associated interrupt bits are immediately set after the Status register is read.

                                    are set when a short circuit or voltage fault occurs on the DIO driver output (see the DIO
        D3              DIOFaultInt Fault Detection section for more information). IRQ asserts when DIOFault is 1. Read the
                                    Status register to clear the DIOFaultInt bit and deassert IRQ. If DIO fault is still present
                                    during the next autoretry cycle, the DIOFault bit and IRQ is set again.
                                    Internal 3.3V LDO (LDO33) Undervoltage Warning. Both the UV33Int interrupt bit and
                                    the UV33En bit (in the Mode register) are set when VLDO33 falls below the 2.4V LDO33
                                    undervoltage threshold. If UV33En is set in the Mode register, IRQ asserts low when the
        D2               UV33Int    UV33Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV33Int bit and deassert IRQ.
                                    Set the UV33En bit to 1 in the Mode register to enable undervoltage monitoring for
                                    UV33Int. When enabled, UV asserts high when the UV33Int bit is 1. UV deasserts when
                                    VLDO33 rises above the LDO33 undervoltage threshold.
                                    VCC Undervoltage Interrupt. The UV24Int interrupt bit and the UV24 bit (in the Mode
                                    register) are set when the VCC voltage falls below the 6V undervoltage threshold. IRQ
        D1               UV24Int
                                    asserts low when the UV24Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV24Int bit
                                    and deassert IRQ. VCC undervoltage detection cannot be disabled.
                                    Overtemperature Warning. The OTempInt interrupt bit and the OTemp bit (in the Mode
                                    register) are set when a high-temperature condition is detected by the devices. OTemp
                                    is set when the temperature of the die exceeds +125°C (typ). OTempInt is set and IRQ
        D0               OTempInt
                                    asserts when the OTemp bit is 1. The OTempInt bit is cleared and IRQ deasserts when
                                    the Status register is read. Once cleared, OTempInt is not reset if the die temperature
                                    remains above the thermal-warning threshold and does not fall below +102°C.

                                              DIO Receiver Filter Control. The DIO receiver has an all-analog lowpass
                                              filter to reduce high-frequency noise on the receiver input. Set the RxFilter bit
         D7                    RxFilter       to 0 to set the filter corner frequency to 500kHz. Set the RxFilter bit to 1 to set
                                              the filter corner frequency to 1MHz. Noise filters on C/Q and DI are controlled
                                              simultaneously by the RxFilter bit.

                                              DIO Driver npn/pnp Mode. The DIO_N/P bit selects between low-side (npn)
                                              and high-side (pnp) modes when the DIO driver is configured as an open-drain
         D5                   DIO_N/P
                                              output (DIO_PP = 0). Set DIO_N/P to 1 to configure the driver for low-side (npn)
                                              operation. Set DIO_N/P to 0 for high-side (PNP) operation.
                                              DIO Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set DIO_PP to 1 to enable push-pull
         D4                    DIO_PP
                                              operation on the DIO driver. The DIO output is open-drain when DIO_PP is 0.
                                              DIO Driver Enable/Disable. Set the DIODEn bit to 1 to enable the DIO driver.
         D3                    DIODEn
                                              Set DIODEn to 0 for hardware (DIOEN) control. See Table 4.
                                              DIO Driver Output Logic. The Q bit can be used to program the C/Q output
                                              driver through software. The DIO driver must be enabled and LIO must be high
                                              to control the DIO driver through the Q bit (Figure 7). DIO has the same logic
                                              polarity as the Q bit.

                                              Set the Q bit to 0 to control the DIO driver with LIO.
                                              The DIO driver output state depends on the DIO_PP and DIO_N/P bits as
                                              shown in Table 5. Note that Table 5 assumes that the C/Q driver is enabled
                                              (DIOEN = VL or DIODEn = 1).
                                              DIO Receiver Enable/Disable. Set the RxDis bit to 1 to disable the DIO

                                              receiver. The RX output is high when RxDis is 1.

                                                   DO Output Polarity. Set the DoInv bit to 1 to invert the logic of the DO

                                                   DO Antivalent Operation. Set the DoAv bit to 1 to enable antivalent
                                                   output operation on DO. DO tracks the LIO and input (and the Q bit) when

                                                   DoAv is 1 (Table 6). The LO input and the DoBit are ignored when the

                                                   DO Driver npn/pnp Operation. The DoN/P bit selects between low-side
                                                   (npn) and high-side (pnp) modes when the DO driver is configured as an

                                                   low-side (npn) operation. Set DoN/P to 0 for high-side (pnp) operation.
                                                   DO Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set the DoPP bit to 1 to configure the
           D4                     DoPP             DO driver output for push-pull operation. DO is an open-drain output
                                                   when DoPP is 0.
                                                   DO Driver Enable/Disable. Set the DoEn bit to 1 to enable the DO driver.

 the current status of fault conditions. When writing to the Mode register, the contents of the fault indication bits
 (bits 2 to 5) do not change.
