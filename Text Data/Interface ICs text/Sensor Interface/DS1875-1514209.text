Note 1:    All voltages are referenced to ground. Current into IC is positive, and current out of the IC is negative.
Note 2:    Digital inputs are at rail. FETG is disconnected. SDA = SCL = VCC. SW, DAC1, and M4DAC are not loaded.
Note 3:    See the Safety Shutdown (FETG) Output section for details.
Note 4:    Eight ranges allow the full scale to change from 625mV to 2.5V.
Note 5:    Eight ranges allow the full scale to change from 312.5mV to 1.25V.
Note 6:    This specification applies to the expected full-scale value for the selected range. See the COMP RANGING register
           description for available full-scale ranges.
Note 7:    The output impedance of the DS1875 is proportional to its scale setting. For instance, if using the 1/2 scale, the output
           impedance would be approximately 1.56kΩ.
Note 8:    This specification applies to the expected full-scale value for the selected range. See the MOD RANGING register
           description for available full-scale ranges.
Note 9:    The switching frequency is selectable between four values: 131.25kHz, 262.5kHz, 525kHz, and 1050kHz.
Note 10:   See the APC and Quick-Trip Shared Comparator Timing section for details.
Note 11:   Guaranteed by design.
Note 12:   I2C interface timing shown is for fast-mode (400kHz) operation. This device is also backward compatible with I2C stan-
           dard mode.
Note 13:   CB—Total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
Note 14:   EEPROM write begins after a STOP condition occurs.

This register map shows each byte/word (2 bytes) in terms of the row it is on in the memory. The first byte in the row is
located in memory at the row address (hexadecimal) in the leftmost column. Each subsequent byte on the row is
one/two memory locations beyond the previous byte/word’s address. A total of 8 bytes are present on each row. For
more information about each of these bytes, see the corresponding register description.

            Holds the calculated index based on the MON4 voltage measurement. This index is used for the address during
            lookup of Table 06h. M4DAC LUT is 32 bytes from address 80h to 9Fh. The calculation of VINDEX is as follows:
                                                                       MON4

            When configured as a single LUT, all 32 bytes are used for lookup.
            When configured as a double LUT, the first 16 bytes (80h to 8Fh) form the lower LUT and the last 16 bytes (90h to
            9Fh) form the upper LUT.
            For the three different modes, the index used during the lookup function of Table 06h is as follows:
                   Single             1              0        0        VINDEX4      VINDEX3        VINDEX2   VINDEX1   VINDEX0

             controlled by active feedback from the BMD pin. The remaining bits are the digital value used for the BIAS
             output regardless of the value of OL.

               The values in this table combined with the MOD bits in the MOD RANGING register (Table 02h, Register 8Bh)
               determine the set point for the modulation voltage. The temperature measurement is used to index the LUT
               (TINDEX, Table 02h, Register 81h) in 2°C increments from -40°C to +102°C, starting at 80h in Table 04h.
               Register 80h defines the -40°C to -38°C MOD output, Register 81h defines the -38°C to -36°C MOD output, and
               so on. Values recalled from this EEPROM memory table are written into the MOD DAC (Table 02h, Register 82h)
               location that holds the value until the next temperature conversion. The DS1875 can be placed into a manual

               temperature compensation functionality is not required, then program the entire Table 04h, to the desired
               modulation setting.
