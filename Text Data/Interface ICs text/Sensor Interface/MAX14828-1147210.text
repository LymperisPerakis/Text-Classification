 The INTERRUPT register reflects current state of various fault conditions. The IRQ/OC output asserts when any of the
 bits in the INTERRUPT register is set. INTERRUPT register bits are latched and are not cleared when the initiating
 condition is removed. Reading the INTERRUPT register clears all the bits and deasserts IRQ/OC. IRQ/OC reasserts
 only when another fault condition occurs.

          7              ThShutInt            this bit is not cleared until the register is read. The current status of the thermal

                                         0: The MAX14828 is not in thermal shutdown.
                                       Wake-Up Event Interrupt
                                         1: This bit is set when an IO-Link wake-up condition is detected on the C/Q line.

                                         0: No wake-up condition is detected.
                                        The wake-up interrupt can be disabled by setting the WuDis bit to 1.

                                     1: This bit is set when a fault occurs on the C/Q driver (over current or over heating).
        4               CQ_FaultInt       Once set, this bit is not cleared until the register is read. The current status of the

                                     0: No fault on the C/Q driver.
                                    V24 Low Voltage Warning Interrupt
                                     1: This bit is set when V24 falls below the IO-Link low-voltage warning threshold fault
        3                 V24WInt       (V24 < V24W). Once set, this bit is not cleared until the register is read. The current

                                     0: V24 is greater than the low-voltage warning threshold.

                                     1: This bit is set when V24 falls below the UVLO threshold (V24 < V24UVLO). Once
        2                 UV24Int       set, this bit is not cleared until the register is read. The current status of the thermal
                                        shutdown condition can be read in the STATUS register.
                                     0: V24 is greater than the UVLO threshold.
        1                          This bit is not used.
                                    Overtemperature Warning Interrupt
                                    1: This bit is set when the die temperature exceeds the warning threshold (TJ > TWRN).
        0                TempWInt       Once set, this bit is not cleared until the register is read. The current status of the
                                        thermal shutdown condition can be read in the STATUS register.
                                    0: The die temperature has not exceeded the overtemperature warning threshold.

SPI Burst Access
Burst access allows writing or reading in one block,
by only defining the initial register address in the SPI
command byte. Once the initial SPI address is received,                           V24
the MAX14828 automatically increments the register after
each SPI data byte. Efficient programming of multiple
consecutive registers is thus possible. Chip select, CS/
PP, must be kept low during the whole write/read cycle.
The SPI clock continues clocking throughout the burst
access cycle. The burst cycle ends when the SPI master
pulls CS/PP high.                                                      MAX14828
