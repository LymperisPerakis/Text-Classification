NOTES
1
  A and B represent the Mean Average Deviation (MAD) of the detected sine waves V A and VB. The polarity of VOUT is affected by the sign of the A comparator, i.e.,
  multiply VOUT × +1 for ACOMP+ > ACOMP–, and VOUT × –1 for ACOMP– > ACOMP+.
2
  Nonlinearity of the AD698 only in units of ppm of full scale. Nonlinearity is defined as the maximum measured deviation of the AD698 output voltage from a
  straight line. The straight line is determined by connecting the maximum produced full-scale negative voltage with the maximum produced full-scale positive voltage.
3
  See Transfer Function.
4
  For example, if the excitation to the primary changes by 1 dB, the gain of the system will change by typically 100 ppm.
5
  Output ripple is a function of the AD698 bandwidth determined by C1 and C2. A 1000 pF capacitor should be connected in parallel with R2 to reduce the output
  ripple. See Figures 7, 8 and 13.
6
  R1 is shown in Figures 7, 8 and 13.
7
  Excitation voltage drift is not an important specification because of the ratiometric operation of the AD698.
8
  From TMIN to TMAX the overall error due to the AD698 alone is determined by combining gain error, gain drift and offset drift. For example, the typical overall
  error for the AD698AP from T MIN to TMAX is calculated as follows: Overall Error = Gain Error at +25°C (± 0.2% Full Scale) + Gain Drift from –40°C to +25°C
  (20 ppm/°C × 65°C) + Offset Drift from –40°C to +25°C (5 ppm/°C × 65°C) = ± 0.36% of full scale. Note that 1000 ppm of full scale equals 0.1% of full scale.
Specifications subject to change without notice.
Specifications shown in boldface are tested on all production units at final electrical test. Results from those tested are used to calculate outgoing quality levels.
All min and max specifications are guaranteed, although only those shown in boldface are tested on all production units.

accumulate on the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection.                                                           WARNING!
Although the AD698 features proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may
