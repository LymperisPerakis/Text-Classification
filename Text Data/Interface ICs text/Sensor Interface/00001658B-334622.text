 It is our intention to provide our valued customers with the best documentation possible to ensure successful use of your Microchip
 products. To this end, we will continue to improve our publications to better suit your needs. Our publications will be refined and
 enhanced as new volumes and updates are introduced.
 If you have any questions or comments regarding this publication, please contact the Marketing Communications Department via
 E-mail at docerrors@microchip.com. We welcome your feedback.
 Most Current Data Sheet
 To obtain the most up-to-date version of this data sheet, please register at our Worldwide Web site at:
        http://www.microchip.com
 You can determine the version of a data sheet by examining its literature number found on the bottom outside corner of any page.
 The last character of the literature number is the version number, (e.g., DS30000000A is version A of document DS30000000).
 Errata
 An errata sheet, describing minor operational differences from the data sheet and recommended workarounds, may exist for cur-
 rent devices. As device/documentation issues become known to us, we will publish an errata sheet. The errata will specify the
 revision of silicon and revision of document to which it applies.
 To determine if an errata sheet exists for a particular device, please check with one of the following:
 • Microchip’s Worldwide Web site; http://www.microchip.com
 • Your local Microchip sales office (see last page)
 When contacting a sales office, please specify which device, revision of silicon and data sheet (include -literature number) you are
 using.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
