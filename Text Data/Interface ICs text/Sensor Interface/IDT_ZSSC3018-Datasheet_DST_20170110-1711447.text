1. IC Characteristics
1.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings
Note: The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The ZSSC3018 might not function or be operable above the recommended
operating conditions. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also damage the device. In addition, extended exposure to
stresses above the recommended operating conditions might affect device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute
Maximum Ratings.”

   [a] Power supply rejection is reduced if a current in the range of 16.5mA > IVDDB > 1.8mA is drawn out of VDDB.
A dynamic power-on-reset circuit is implemented in order to achieve the minimum current consumption in Sleep Mode. The VDD low level,
the subsequent rise time, and the VDD rising slope must meet the requirements in Table 1.3 to guarantee an overall IC reset: lower VDD low
levels allow slower rising of the subsequent on-ramp of VDD. Other combinations might also be possible. For example, the reset trigger can
be influenced by increasing the power-down time and lowering the VDD rising slope requirement. Alternatively, the RES pin can be connected
and used to control safe resetting of the IC. RES is low-active – a VDD-VSS-VDD transition at the RES pin leads to a complete ZSSC3018
reset.

2. Circuit Description
2.1 Brief Description
The ZSSC3018 provides a highly accurate amplification of bridge sensor signals. The compensation of sensor offset, sensitivity, temperature
drift, and non-linearity is accomplished via a 26-bit DSP core running a correction algorithm with calibration coefficients stored in a non-
volatile memory. The ZSSC3018 can be configured for a wide range of resistive bridge sensor types and for absolute voltage-source sensors.
A digital interface (SPI or I2C) enables communication. The ZSSC3018 supports two operational modes: Normal Mode and Command Mode.
Normal Mode is the standard operating mode. Typically in Normal Mode, the ZSSC3018 wakes up from Sleep Mode (low power), runs a
measurement in Active State, and automatically returns to the Sleep Mode. (See section 3.3 for details on operational modes.)
2.2 Signal Flow and Block Diagram
See Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2 for the ZSSC3018 block diagram for different input sensors. The sensor bridge supply VDDB and the power
supply for analog circuitry are provided by a voltage regulator, which is optimized for power supply disturbance rejection (PSRR). See section
1.4 for a graph of PSRR versus frequency. To improve noise suppression, the digital blocks are powered by a separate voltage regulator. A
power supervision circuit monitors all supply voltages and generates appropriate reset signals for initializing the digital blocks.
The System Control Unit controls the analog circuitry to perform the three measurement types: external sensor, temperature, and offset
measurement. The multiplexer selects the signal input to the amplifier, which can be the external signals from the input pins INP and INN or
the internal temperature reference sensor signals. A full measurement request will trigger an automatic sequence of all measurement types
and all input signals.

The amplifier consists of two stages with programmable gain values.
The ZSSC3018 employs a programmable analog-to-digital converter (ADC) optimized for conversion speed and noise suppression. The
programmable resolution from 12 to 18 bits provides flexibility for adapting the conversion characteristics. To improve power supply noise
suppression, the ADC uses the bridge supply VDDB as its reference voltage leading to a ratiometric measurement topology if the external
sensor is a bridge-type element.
The remaining IC-internal offset and the sensor element offset, i.e., the overall system offset for the amplifier and ADC, can be canceled by
means of an offset and auto-zero measurement, respectively.
The DSP accomplishes the auto-zero, span, and 1st and 2nd order temperature compensation of the measured external sensor signal. The
correction coefficients are stored in the MTP memory.
The ZSSC3018 supports SPI and I2C interface communication for controlling the ZSSC3018, configuration, and measurement result output.

2.3.1 Amplifier
The amplifier has a fully differential architecture and consists of two stages. The amplification of each stage and the external sensor gain
polarity are programmable via settings in the Measurement Configuration Registers SM_config1 and SM_config2 (addresses 12HEX and
16HEX; see section 3.6.2) in the MTP memory (see section 2.4.2). Only one of these two possible configurations is used for measurements.
The default configuration is SM_config1. Alternately, SM_config2 can be implemented by sending a command to select this configuration for
the measurement (see section 3.5.1). The term SM_config is used for general register content and functionality explanations for both,
SM_config1 and SM_config2, as the registers’ bit assignments are exactly the same for both registers.
The first 6 bits of SM_config are the programmable gain settings Gain_stage1 and Gain_stage2. The options for the programmable gain
settings are listed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2.

If needed, the polarity of the sensor bridge gain can be reversed by setting the Gain_polarity bit, which is bit 6 in the SM_config register (see
section 3.6.2). Changing the gain polarity is achieved by inverting the chopper clock. Table 2.3 gives the settings for the Gain_polarity bit.
This feature enables applying a sensor to the ZSSC3018 with swapped input signals at INN and INP; e.g., to avoid crossing wires for the final
sensor module’s assembly.

2.3.2 Analog-to-Digital Converter
An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to digitize the amplifier signal. To allow optimizing the trade-off between conversion time and
resolution, the resolution can be programmed from 12-bit to 18-bit (see Adc_bits, SM_config register; section 3.6.2). The ADC processes
differential input signals.

The ADC can perform an offset shift in order to adapt input signals with offsets to the ADC input range. The shift feature is enabled by setting
SM_config registers’ bit[15] = 1 (Shift_method = 1). The respective analog offset shift can be set up with bits[14:12], the Offset bit field in
SM_config.
Note: The offset shift causes the ADC to perform an additional amplification of the ADC’s input signal by a factor of 2. This must be
considered for a correct analog sensor setup using the pre-amplifier’s gain, the ADC offset shift, and the potential ADC gain.
The overall analog amplification Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ GainADC can be determined for the following options:
    If no offset shift is selected, i.e. Shift_method = 0 and Offset = 000 in SM_config:
            Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ 1
    If ADC offset shift is selected, i.e. Shift_method = 1 and Offset  000 in SM_config:
            Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ 2

Important: If the required configuration is no offset shift and no additional gain factor (and therefore GainADC = 1), then the only valid settings
are Shift_method = 0 and Offset = 000 in SM_config. Any other setup using Shift_method = 0 combined with Offset ≠ 000 leads to erroneous
analog setups.
The setting for ADC resolution for the external sensor (bridge or voltage-source sensor) affects the typical measurement duration and noise
performance as shown in Table 2.6 for the example of a bridge sensor measurement using the “Measure” command (AAHEX; see section
3.4.1). See section 3.2 for definitions of measurement types AZSM, SM, AZTM, and TM.

  [a] Measurement duration is defined as the time from the high/low transition on the EOC pin at the beginning of the measurement until the next
        low/high transition on the EOC signal at the end of a single measurement in Sleep Mode.
  [b] Reference noise values normalized to the external sensor’s ADC resolution; obtained with the setup: 20kΩ sensor bridge, 25°C operating
        temperature, gain=52, ADC offset=25%, VDD=1.8V.
2.3.3 Selection of Gain and Offset – Sensor System Dimensioning
The optimal gain (and offset) setup for a specific sensor element can be determined by the following steps:
     1.   Collect sensor element’s characteristic, statistical data (over temperature, ambient sensor parameter, and over production
          tolerances):
          a.   Minimum differential output voltage: Vmin
          b.   Maximum differential output voltage: Vmax
          Note: The best possible setup can only be determined if the absolute value of Vmax is greater than the absolute value of Vmin. If this
          is not the case, the gain polarity should be reversed by means of the Gain_polarity bit in the SM_config register (see section 3.6.2).
     2.   Calculate:
          a.   Common mode level; i.e., differential offset of the sensor output:
                VCM = 0.5 ∗ (Vmax + Vmin )
          b.   Relative or percent offset of the sensor output:
                                           VCM
                Offsetsensor [%] =                    ∗ 100%
                                       Vmax - Vmin
     3.   Determine which of the two following cases is valid.
          a.   If Offsetsensor [%] > 43% then select Offset = 111 (i.e., 43.25%)
          b.   If 0% < Offsetsensor [%] < 43% then select Offset ≤ Offsetsensor [%]
               (see Table 2.5 for possible ADC Offset setup values)
     4.   The total required, optimum gain can be determined as
                                    1.4V
          Gaintotal, opt =             Offsetsensor
                           Vmax ∗ (1 -              )
                                           100
          Configure gain factors in the following step such that Gaintotal ≤ Gaintotal,opt (see section 2.3.1).
     5.   The gain setup can be separated into the three factors Gainamp1, Gainamp2 (for the stage 2 amplifier) and GainADC (1 for no-shift or 2
          for shift operation) according to
          Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ GainADC .
          a.   If no offset shift is performed (Shift_method = 0 and Offset = 000), the amplifier gain is Gaintotal.
          b.   If an offset shift is performed (Shift_method = 1), the amplifier gain is 0.5  Gaintotal.

2.3.4 Temperature Measurement
The ZSSC3018 provides an internal temperature sensor measurement to allow compensation for temperature effects. See section 1.3 for the
temperature sensor resolution. The temperature output signal is a differential voltage that is adapted by the amplifier for the ADC input.
For temperature measurements, the respective settings are defined and programmed to the MTP by IDT.
2.3.5 External Sensor Supply: Bridge Sensors
The ZSSC3018 provides dedicated supply pins VDDB and VSSB for resistive bridge-type sensors (AbsV_enable bit[11]=0 in SM_config
registers 12HEX or 16HEX; see section 3.6.2). The ADC reference voltages for the sensor bridge measurement are derived from these internal
voltages such that bridge supply disturbances are suppressed. The current drive ability of VDDB is limited (see IVDDB in section 1.2).
2.3.6 External Sensor: Absolute Voltage Source Sensors
As an optional alternative to a bridge sensor application, the ZSSC3018 can process signals from an absolute-voltage source sensor; e.g., a
thermopile element. The respective input type can be selected with AbsV_enable bit[11]=1 in SM_config, registers 12HEX or 16HEX. The
absolute-voltage source sensor element must be connected between the INP and INN pins; INN is internally connected to the ZSSC3018’s
analog ground (important: this is not VSSB). Do not connect VDDB and VSSB if an absolute-voltage source sensor is applied. The offset shift
should be set to maximum in this case: Shift_method = 1 and Offset = 111 in SM_config. The required gain can be determined according to
the procedure described in section 2.3.3.

2.4          Digital Section
2.4.1 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Core
The DSP core block performs the algorithm for correcting the sensor signal. The required coefficients are stored in the MTP memory.
When the measurement results are available, the "end of conversion" signal is set at the EOC pin if no interrupt-threshold has been set up
(bits[8:7]=00 in register 02HEX; see section 3.6.2). The internal EOC information is valid only if both the measurement and calculation have
been completed. Alternatively, the EOC pin can indicate exceeding or underrunning a specified threshold or leaving a valid-result range as
described in section 3.3.
2.4.2 MTP Memory
The ZSSC3018’s memory is designed with a true multiple-time programmable (MTP) structure. The memory is organized in 16-bit registers
that can be re-written multiple (at least 1000) times. The user has access to a 57 x 16-bit storage area for values such as calibration
coefficients. The required programming voltage is generated internally in the ZSSC3018. A checksum of the whole memory is evaluated for
integrity-checking purposes. The checksum can be generated with command 90HEX (see section 3.4.1).
2.4.3 Clock Generator
The clock generator provides approximately 4MHz, and 1MHz clock signals as the time base for IC-internal signal processing. The frequency
is trimmed during production test.
2.4.4 Power Supervision
The power supervision block, which is a part of the voltage regulator combined with the digital section, monitors all power supplies to ensure a
defined reset of all digital blocks during power-up or power supply interruptions. “Brown-out” events at the supply that do not meet the power-
on-reset (POR) requirements (see Table 1.3), must be resolved with a reset pulse at the RES pin.
2.4.5 Interface
The ZSSC3018 can communicate with the user’s communication master or computer via an SPI or I2C interface *. The interface type is
selectable by the first activity at the interface immediately after power-up or reset:
      a.     If the first command is an I2C command and the SS pin has been inactive until this command is received, the ZSSC3018 enters I2C
             Mode.
      b.     If the first interface action sets the SS pin to active (active-HIGH or active-LOW dependents on the SS_polarity bit[9] in register
             02HEX; see section 3.6.2), then the ZSSC3018 enters SPI Mode.
Note: During the initiation sequence (after power-up or reset) any potential transition on SS is ignored. Switching to SPI Mode is only possible
after the power-up sequence. If SS is not connected, the SS pin internal pull-up keeps the ZSSC3018 in I2CTM Mode.
To also provide interface accessibility in Sleep Mode (all features inactive except the digital interface logic), the interface circuitry is directly
supplied by VDD.

3.      Functional Description
3.1       Power-Up
Specifications related to power-up are given in sections 1.2 and 1.3. On power-up, the ZSSC3018 communication interface is able to receive
the first command after the time tSTA1 from when the VDD supply is within operating specifications. The ZSSC3018 can begin the first
measurement after the time tSTA2 from when the VDD supply is operational. As an alternative to a power-on-reset, a reset and new power-up-
sequence can be triggered by an IC-reset signal (high low) at the RES pin.
The wake-up time from Sleep Mode to Active State (see section 3.3) after receiving the activating command is defined as tWUP1 and tWUP2. In
Command Mode, subsequent commands can be sent after tWUP1. The first measurement starts after tWUP2 if a measurement request has been
sent.
3.2       Measurements
Available measurement procedures are
   AZSM: auto-zero (external) sensor measurement
 SM: (external) sensor measurement
 AZTM: auto-zero temperature measurement
 TM: temperature measurement
AZSM: The configuration for the external sensor measurement, i.e. a resistive bridge or an absolute-voltage source, is loaded. The
multiplexer block connects the amplifier input to the AGND analog ground reference. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed so that the
inherent system offset for the respective configuration is converted by the ADC to a digital value, quantized according to the respective MTP
configuration.
SM: The configuration for the external sensor measurement, i.e. a resistive bridge or an absolute-voltage source, is loaded. The multiplexer
connects the amplifier input to the INP and INN pins accordingly. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed. The result is a digital value
with a resolution according to the MTP configuration.
AZTM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The multiplexer connects the amplifier input to AGND. An analog-to-digital
conversion is performed so that the inherent system offset for the temperature configuration is converted by the ADC to a digital value,
quantized according to the respective MTP configuration.
TM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The multiplexer connects the amplifier input to the internal temperature
sensor. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed. The result is a digital value with a resolution according to the MTP configuration.
The typical application’s measurement cycle is a complete SSC measurement (using one of the commands AAHEX to AFHEX) with AZSM, SM,
AZTM, and TM followed by a signal correction calculation.
3.3       Interrupt (EOC Pin)
The EOC pin can be programmed to operate either as a pure “measurement busy” and end-of-conversion (EOC) transducer, or as a
configurable interrupt transducer. The respective basic operation must be programmed to the INT_setup bits [1:0] in register 02HEX [8:7] (see
section 3.6.2). One or two 24-bit-quantized thresholds can be programmed (TRSH1, TRSH2 in memory registers13HEX, 14HEX and 15HEX).
Dependent on the INT_setup selection, the EOC pin provides a logic 1 or logic 0 (also dependent on the respective interface setup; e.g., SPI
with logic 0  VDD or logic 0  VSS, etc.) according to the SSC-corrected result. The respective thresholds are programmed left-aligned in
the memory, such that they must be programmed with the threshold’s MSB in the memory register’s MSB, etc. The LSBs of the 24-bit
threshold in the memory must be truncated to the number of bits of the selected ADC resolution (according to Adc_bits).

The interrupt functionality is only available for digital values from the SSC-calculation unit – raw values cannot be monitored by the interrupt
feature. Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 show the different setup options and the respective response at the EOC pin. The use of the interrupt
functionality is recommended for cyclic operation. Only in cyclic operation (command ABHEX with respective power-down setup in the 02HEX
register Interface Configuration), the EOC-level continuously represents the respective SSC-measurement result. For single or oversample
measurement requests without cyclic operation, the EOC output signal is reset to logical zero at the beginning of each new measurement,
even though the interrupt thresholds are established correctly (setting EOC to logical one or zero is dependent on interrupt setup) at the end
of each measurement.

3.4 Operational Modes
Figure 3.3 illustrates the ZSSC3018 power-up sequence and subsequent operation depending on the selected interface communication mode
(I2C or SPI) as determined by interface related first activities after power-up or reset. If the first command after power-up is a valid I2CTM
command, the interface will react as an I²C interface until the next power-on-reset (POR). If there is no valid I2C command, but an active
signal at the SS pin is detected as the first valid activity, then the interface will respond as an SPI slave. With either interface, after the voltage
regulators are switched on, the ZSSC3018’s low voltage section (LV) is active while the related interface configuration information is read
from memory. Then the LV section is switched off, the ZSSC3018 goes into Sleep Mode, and the interface is ready to receive commands.
Since the interface is always powered by VDD, it is referred to as the high voltage section (HV).
See Table 3.1 for definitions of the commands.
Figure 3.4 shows the ZSSC3018 operation in Normal Mode (with two operation principles: “Sleep” and “Cyclic”) and Command Mode
including when the LV and HV sections are active as indicated by the color legend. The Normal Mode automatically returns to Sleep Mode
after executing the requested measurements, or periodically wakes up and conducts another measurement according to the selection of the
“sleep duration” with the CYC_period (bits[14:12] in memory register 02HEX). In Command Mode, the ZSSC3018 remains active if a dedicated
command (Start_NOM) has been sent, which is helpful during calibration. Command Mode can only be entered if Start_CM (command A9HEX;
see Table 3.1) is the first command received after POR.

3.4.1 SPI/I2C Commands
The SPI/I2C commands supported by the ZSSC3018 are listed in Table 3.1. The command to read an address in the user memory is the
same as its address. The command to write to an address in user memory is the address plus 40HEX.
There is a IDT-reserved section of memory that can be read but not over-written by the user.
Table 3.1       SPI/I2C Commands
Note: Every return starts with a status byte followed by the data word as described in section 3.5.1.
Note: The output for any ADC measurement and signal conditioning calculation is formatted as a 24-bit data word, regardless of the effective
ADC resolution used.

3.5        Communication Interface
3.5.1 Common Functionality
Commands are handled by the command interpreter in the LV section. Commands that need additional data are not treated differently than
other commands because the HV interface is able to buffer the command and all the data that belongs to the command and the command
interpreter is activated as soon as a command byte is received.
Every response starts with a status byte followed by the data word. The data word depends on the previous command. It is possible to read
the same data more than once if the read request is repeated (I2C) or a NOP command is sent (SPI). If the next command is not a read
request (I²C) or a NOP (SPI), it invalidates any previous data.
The ZSSC3018 supports the parallel setup of two amplifier-ADC configurations by means of SM_config1 (default) and SM_config2. Switching
between the two setups can be done with the commands B0HEX (selects SM_config1) and B1HEX (selects SM_config2), whereas the
respective activation command must always be sent prior to the measurement request.
The status byte contains the following bits (see Table 3.3, for sequence):
   Power indication (bit 6): 1 if the device is powered (VDDB on); 0 if not powered. This is needed for SPI Mode where the master reads all
     zeros if the device is not powered or in power-on reset (POR).
   Busy indication (bit 5): 1 if the device is busy, which indicates that the data for the last command is not available yet. No new commands
     are processed if the device is busy.
     Note: The device is always busy if the cyclic measurement operation has been set up and started.
   Actual ZSSC3018 mode (bits 4:3): 00 = Normal Mode; 01 = Command Mode; 1X = IDT-reserved. See Table 3.4.
   Memory integrity/error flag (bit 2): 0 if integrity test passed, 1 if test failed. This bit indicates whether the checksum-based integrity check
     passed or failed. The memory error status bit is calculated only during the power-up sequence, so a newly written CRC will only be used
     for memory verification and status update after a subsequent ZSSC3018 power-on reset (POR) or reset by means of the RES pin.
   Config Setup (bit 1): Indicates the selection of the SM_config register being used (register 12HEX: SM_config1 or register 16HEX:
     SM_config2). The respective separate configuration setup allows two different configurations of the external sensor channel in order to
     support up to two application scenarios with the use of only one sensor-IC pair. This bit is 0 (default) if SM_config1 was selected. This bit
     is 1 if SM_config2 was selected.
   ALU saturation (bit 0): If the last command was a measurement request, this bit is 0 if any intermediate value and the final SSC result are
     in a valid range and no SSC-calculation internal saturation occurred, respectively. If the last command was a measurement request, this
     bit is 1 if an SSC-calculation internal saturation occurred. This bit is also 0 for any non-measurement command.

Further status information can be provided by the EOC pin. The EOC pin is set high when a measurement and calculation have been
completed (if no interrupt threshold is used; i.e., INT_setup==00BIN, see section 3.3).
3.5.2 SPI
The SPI Mode is available if the very first interface activity (after ZSSC3018 power-up) is an active signal at the SS pin. The polarity and
phase of the SPI clock are programmable via the CKP_CKE setting in register 02HEX as described in Table 3.5. CKP_CKE is two bits: CPHA
(bit 10), which selects which edge of SCLK latches data, and CPOL (bit 11), which indicates whether SCLK is high or low when it is idle. The
polarity of the SS signal and pin are programmable via the SS_polarity setting (bit 9). The different combinations of polarity and phase are
illustrated in the figures below.

In SPI Mode, each command except NOP is started as shown in Figure 3.7. After the execution of a command (busy = 0), the expected data
can be read as illustrated in Figure 3.8 or if no data are returned by the command, the next command can be sent. The status can be read at
any time with the NOP command (see Figure 3.9).

3.5.3 I2C
I2C Mode will be selected if the very first interface activity (after IC power-up) is an I2C command. In I2C Mode, each command is started as
shown in Figure 3.10. Only the number of bytes that is needed for the command must be sent. An exception is the I2C High Speed Mode
(controlled by the Slave_Addr bit field in register 02HEX in Table 3.5) where 3 bytes must always be sent as in SPI Mode. After the execution
of a command (busy = 0), the expected data can be read as illustrated in Figure 3.12 or if no data are returned by the command, the next
command can be sent. The status can be read at any time as illustrated in Figure 3.11.

All mandatory I²C-bus protocol features are implemented. Optional features like clock stretching, 10-bit slave address, etc., are not supported
by the ZSSC3018’s interface.
In I²C High Speed Mode, a command consists of a fixed length of three bytes.
3.6       Memory
In the ZSSC3018, the memory is organized in 16-bit wide registers and can be programmed multiple (at least 1000) times (MTP). There are
57 x 16-bit registers available for customer use. Each register can be re-programmed. Basically, there are two MTP content sectors:
    Customer Use: Accessible by means of regular write operations (40HEX to 79HEX). It contains: the customer ID, interface setup data,
      measurement setup information, calibration coefficients, etc.
 IDT Use: Only accessible for write operations by IDT. The IDT sector contains specific trim information and is programmed during
      manufacturing test by IDT.
3.6.1 Programming Memory
Programming memory is possible with any specified supply voltage level at VDD. The MTP programming voltage itself is generated by means
of an integrated charge pump, generating an internal memory programming voltage; no additional external voltage, other than VDD (as
specified), needed. A single 16-bit register write will be completed within 16ms after the respective programming command has been sent.
After the memory is programmed, it must be read again to verify the validity of the memory contents.

3.7 Calibration Sequence
Calibration essentially involves collecting raw signal and temperature data from the sensor-ZSSC3018 system for different known sensor-
element values (i.e., a resistive bridge or an absolute voltage source) and temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the
calibration master (assumed to be the user’s computer), and the calculated calibration coefficients can then be written to on-chip memory.
Here is a brief overview of the three main steps involved in calibrating the ZSSC3018.
Assigning a unique identification to the ZSSC3018. This identification is written to shadow RAM and programmed in MTP memory. This
unique identification can be stored in the two 16-bit registers dedicated to the customer ID (00HEX and 01HEX; see Table 3.5). It can be used as
an index into a database stored on the calibration computer. This database will contain all the raw values of the connected sensor-element
readings and temperature readings for that part, as well as the known sensor-element measurand conditions and temperature to which the
sensor-element was exposed.
Data collection. Data collection involves getting uncorrected or raw data from the external sensor at different known measurand values and
temperatures. Then this data is stored on the calibration computer using the unique identification of the device as the index to the database.
Coefficient calculation and storage in MTP memory. After enough data points have been collected to calculate all the desired coefficients, the
coefficients can be calculated by the calibrating computer. Then the coefficients can be programmed to the MTP memory.
Result. The sensor signal and the characteristic temperature effect on output will be linearized according to the setup-dependent maximum
output range.
It is essential to perform the calibration with a fixed programming setup during the data collection phase. In order to prevent any accidental
incorrect processing, it is further recommended that the MTP memory setup is kept stable during the whole calibration process as well as in
the subsequent operation. A ZSSC3018 calibration only fits the setup used during its calibration. Changes of functional parameters after a
successful calibration can decrease the precision and accuracy performance of the ZSSC3018 as well as of the whole application.
Note: The ZSSC3018 supports operation with different sensor setups via the SM_config1 and SM_config2 registers. However, only one
calibration coefficient set is supported. Therefore, either an alternative ZSSC3218-external signal calibration using the alternate SM_config
settings must also be performed to ensure that the programmed SSC coefficients are valid for both setups, or a full reprogramming of the
SSC coefficients must be performed each time the sensor setup is changed. The selection of the external sensor setup (i.e., the AFE
configuration) can be done with the interface commands B0HEX and B1HEX.
3.7.1 Calibration Step 1 – Assigning Unique Identification
Assign a unique identification number to the ZSSC3018 by using the memory write command (40HEX + data and 41HEX + data; see Table 3.1
and Table 3.5) to write the identification number to Cust_ID0 at memory address 00HEX and Cust_ID1 at address 01HEX as described in
section 3.6.1. These two 16-bit registers allow for more than 4 billion unique devices.
3.7.2 Calibration Step 2 – Data Collection
The number of unique points (measurand and/or temperature) at which calibration must be performed generally depends on the requirements
of the application and the behavior of the sensor in use. The minimum number of points required is equal to the number of correction
coefficients to be corrected with a minimum of three different temperatures at three different sensor values. For a full calibration resulting in
values for all 7 possible (external) sensor coefficients and 3 possible temperature coefficients, a minimum of 7 pairs of sensor with
temperature measurements must be collected.
Within this minimum field of 3 measurand measurements x 3 temperature measurements, data must be collected for the specific value pairs
(at known conditions) and then processed to calculate the coefficients. In order to obtain the potentially best and most robust coefficients, it is
recommended that measurement pairs (temperature vs. measurand) be collected at the outer corners of the intended operation range or at
least at points that are located far apart. It is also essential to provide highly precise reference values as nominal, expected values. The
measurement precision of the external calibration-measurement equipment should be ten times more accurate than the expected ZSSC3018
output accuracy after calibration in order to avoid accuracy losses caused by the nominal reference values (e.g., measurand signal and
temperature deviations).
Note: The coefficients SENS_shift and T_shift must not be determined during this calibration step.
Strong recommendation: Set these coefficients to zero until after initial calibration.

                                                                                                                           ZSSC3018 Datasheet
Note: An appropriate selection of measurement pairs can significantly improve the overall system performance.
The determination of the measurand-related coefficients will use all of the measurement pairs. For the temperature-related correction
coefficients, 3 of the measurement pairs (at three different temperatures) will be used.
Note: There is an inherent redundancy in the 7 sensor-related and 3 temperature-related coefficients. Since the temperature is a necessary
output (which also needs correction), the temperature-related information is mathematically separated, which supports faster and more
efficient DSP calculations during the normal usage of the sensor-ZSSC3018 system. The recommended approach for data collection is to
make use of the raw-measurement commands described in Table 3.2:
For external sensor values, either of the following commands can be used depending on the user’s requirements:
    A2HEX + 0000HEX: Single sensor measurement for which the configuration register will be loaded from the SM_config1 register (12HEX in
                          MTP); preprogramming the measurement setup in the MTP is required.
                          Note: SM_config1 is the default configuration. Alternatively, SM_config2 (16HEX in MTP) can be used by first sending
                          the command B1HEX (see section 3.7.5).
 A3HEX + ssssHEX: Single sensor measurement for which the SM_config configuration register (Gain, ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded as
                          the user’s configuration ssssHEX and must be provided externally via the interface as the data part of this command.
For temperature values either of the following commands can be used depending on the user’s requirements:
    A6HEX + 0000HEX: Single temperature measurement for which the configuration register will be loaded from an internal temperature
                          configuration register (preprogrammed by IDT in MTP); preprogramming of the respective configuration is done by
                          IDT prior to ZSSC3018 delivery. This is the recommended approach for temperature data collection.
 A7HEX + ssssHEX: Single temperature measurement for which the configuration register (Gain, ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded as
                          ssssHEX, which must be provided externally via the interface as the data part of this command. In this case, the format
                          and purpose of these configuration bits must be according to the definitions for SM_config and valid for temperature
                          measurement (bits [15:12] will be ignored).
3.7.3 Calibration Step 3a) – Coefficient Calculations
The math to perform the coefficient calculation is complicated and will not be discussed in detail. There is a brief overview in the next section.
IDT will provide software (DLLs) to perform the coefficient calculation (external to the sensor-ZSSC3018 system) based on auto-zero
corrected values. After the coefficients are calculated, the final step is to write them to the MTP memory of the ZSSC3018.
3.7.4 Calibration Step 3b) – Post-Calibration Offset Correction
There are two special SSC-coefficients, SENS_shift and T_shift. Normally, these coefficients must be set to zero during the initial sensor
calibration. The primary purpose of these two coefficients is to cancel additional offset shifts that could occur during or after final sensor
assembly, e.g. if a respective sensor is finally placed and soldered on an application board.
If the final sensor assembly induced any kind of offset (on either the temperature or the external sensor signal), the respective influence can
be directly compensated via the SENS_shift and T_shift coefficients without the need to change the original SSC coefficient set. However,
this post-calibration offset correction must be done under known ambient conditions (i.e., sensor measurand and/or temperature).

3.7.5 SSC Measurements
After the completion of the calibration procedure, linearized external sensor and temperature readings can be obtained using these
commands: AAHEX to AFHEX.
Typically, only one external sensor in a single analog configuration (setup in SM_config1, MTP register 12HEX) will be used. However, the
ZSSC3018 can support a second analog configuration that is set up in SM_config2, MTP register 16HEX. This might be useful in cases where
only one sensor-ZSSC3218 pair must support the measurand ranges for two different external sensors that have different precisions, required
amplification, and sensor offset.
If a respective switching between setups is to be performed, the SSC coefficients for the alternate external sensor must be handled with one
of the following methods:
The programmed SSC coefficients are not used for the alternate external sensor. The ZSSC3218 performs only a one-to-one transfer, i.e. no
effective digital SSC correction – only a transfer of the auto-zero corrected raw ADC readings to the ZSSC3218 output without any scaling,
etc.
The coefficients are re-programmed each time the analog setup is changed.
SM_config1 is selected as analog setup register by default, so no specific activation is needed if only SM_config1 is used. If SM_config2 will
also be used, the activation command B1HEX must be sent once prior to the measurement requests. To switch to using SM_config1, the
activation command B0HEX must be sent prior to use. This respective activation must be refreshed after any power-on-reset or RES pin reset.

3.8 The Calibration Math
3.8.1 Bridge Signal Compensation
The saturation check in the ZSSC3018 detects saturation effects of the internal calculation steps, allowing the final correction output to still be
determined. It is possible to get potentially useful signal conditioning results that have had an intermediate saturation during the calculations.
These cases are detectable by observing the status bit[0] for each measurement result. Details about the saturation limits and the valid
ranges for values are provided in the following equations.
The calibration math description assumes a calculation with integer numbers. The description is numerically correct concerning values,
dynamic range, and resolution.
SOT_curve selects whether second-order equations compensate for sensor nonlinearity with a parabolic or S-shaped curve. The parabolic
compensation is recommended for most sensor types.
For the following equations, the terms are as follows:

3.8.2 Temperature Signal Compensation
Temperature is measured internally. Temperature correction contains both linear gain and offset terms as well as a second-order term to
correct for any nonlinearities. For temperature, second-order compensation for nonlinearity is always parabolic.
The correction formula is best represented as a two-step process as follows:
