Note 2: If a 24V supply is not available, the device can be powered through 5VOUT. In this mode of operation, the VCC24V
         supply must be left unconnected. All other specifications remain identical. The field-supply alarms are asserted indicating
         the absence of the 24V supply in this mode of operation.
Note 3: When using suggested external 2.2kΩ series resistors, limits of -36V to +36V apply.
Note 4: External resistor RREF can be adjusted to set any desired current limit between 0.5mA and 6mA.
Note 5: INn-to-OPn propagation delay difference between two channels on the same IC.
Note 6: Propagation delay from field input (INn) to CMOS output (OPn). Tested with a 6.5V pulse applied directly to the device INn
         pins. Propagation delay is measured between the 50% transitions of the rising and falling edges.
Note 7: The propagation delay limit is 1ms maximum when VTSEL = 0.

Temperature Monitoring
The internal junction temperature of the IC is constantly
monitored and an alarm is raised, by asserting the FAULT
pin, if the temperature rises above TALRM.
Supply Voltage Monitoring
A primary supply voltage-monitor circuit constantly moni-
tors the field-supply voltage. If this voltage falls below a
threshold (VOFFUVLO), an alarm is raised by asserting
the FAULT and UVFAULT pins, indicating to the microcon-
troller that the part is experiencing a fault condition and
the data is not to be trusted. Once the field-supply voltage
has recovered and goes above VONUVLO, the FAULT and
UVFAULT pins are released.
