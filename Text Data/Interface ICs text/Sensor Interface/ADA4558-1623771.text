1
  Guaranteed by absolute maximum ratings (see the Absolute Maximum Ratings section).
2
  The VREG voltage is also the reference to the ADC. Therefore, reference temperature drift does not affect system error. This specification can be useful in gain and
  offset selection at EOL calibration.
3
  Guaranteed by design.
4
  Errors in PGA, temperature sensor gain, offset, and temperature drift are eliminated based on the EOL calibration routine.
5
  The input offset trim range is −60 mV/V to +60 mV/V. The ADC reference is 4 V. The resulting input offset trim range is 0.48 V. The output preferred offset trim
  resolution is 31 mV. For a gain of 2.9, the input referred offset trim resolution is 10.6 mV. Dividing range by resolution gives approximately 50 steps, which is close to a
  6-bit resolution. For a gain of 971, the input referred offset trim resolution is 32 μV. Dividing range by resolution equals 16,287 LSBs, which is close to 14-bit resolution.
  In all cases, this only provides the coarse offset calibration required to get the PGA output into the valid ADC range of operation. The digital linearization engine
  provides fine offset calibration to meet the system accuracy targets.
