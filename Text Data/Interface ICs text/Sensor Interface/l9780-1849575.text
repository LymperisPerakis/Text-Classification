4           Main functionalities
4.1         Power supplies
            4 different power supplies are present in the device: VCCA, VCCD, VCCCP, VCCI,
            respectively for analog part, digital part, charge pump, digital interfaces. Digital inputs are
            compatible with 2 different logic levels (5 V or 3.3 V, the possible levels for VCCI), and are
            converted to the range 0V-VCCD using internal level shifters connected to VCCD and VCCI.
            In the device a negative charge pump is also present and it is used to generate -5 V voltage
            level (on CP pin), to bias the substrate and to allow the excursion to the negative range to
            the output pins of VCCS. Charge pump clock frequency is 2 MHz.
            3 different ground pins are also present in the device: GNDA, GNDD, GNDCP, respectively
            for analog, digital and charge pump circuitry.
            Possible ranges for power supplies, currents consumption and input/output logic levels are
            specified in Table 9, Table 12 and Table 13. External component values are specified in
            Table 19.
4.2         Pin protection
            On the device a high ESD reference voltage pin (VESD) is available and is used as a
            protection for the pins externally connected to the sensor and for HD pin; this voltage must
            be the highest in the application and has to be always connected to the device, through the
            RC low pass filter shown in Figure 12 (external component values are specified in Table 19).
            For pins compatible to negative voltages, the negative ESD reference voltage is the
            substrate (internally connected to CP pin, -5 V). All the other pins have a 5V positive ESD
            protection voltage level and GND as negative ESD protection voltage level.
4.3         Internal references
            Into the device the following voltage references are present:
                  –    a band-gap voltage (typical value 1.215 V) with 3 trimming bits dedicated;
                  –    REF voltage; obtained as the band-gap multiplied by a factor of 1.555; typical
                       value for this voltage is 1.89 V (possible range for this parameter is specified in
                       Table 10.
                  –    REF2 voltage; typical value is about VCCA/2 (possible range for this parameter is
                       specified in Table 11).
            All internal currents are generated from a reference current obtained by the band-gap
            (buffered on BG pin) applied on an external resistance; the possible BG pin voltage range is
            specified in Table 9, the value of external resistance is defined in Table 19.
            All timing references are calculated as multiples of the period of the internal oscillator
            (TOSC); the typical oscillation frequency is 4 MHz, the possible range is specified in
            Table 15. Internal oscillator has 4 trimming bits dedicated.

4.4   Power on reset
      A power on reset (POR) circuit is present into the device; this circuit monitors VCCA,
      VCCCP, VCCD, GNDA, GNDCP, GNDD voltage levels. If one of the supplies falls below (or
      one of the grounds exceeds) the defined POR threshold (defined in Table 10) all the outputs
      are driven in inactive state, all the registers are set at their default state and the time state
      machine and all the timers are fixed in the reset state. All these actions are applied after a
      typical filter time of 15 μs (possible range is defined in Table 15). When the supply that has
      caused POR condition reaches POR value plus hysteresis (or the ground decreases under
      POR threshold) all the outputs are re-enabled.
      During reset condition an internal switch connects the charge pump output voltage (CP pin)
      to GNDA.
4.5   Pin INRC functionalities: INRC amplifier, clean currents, pull-
      down current
      Pin INRC in the application is connected to the sensor reference cell; the voltage generated
      by this cell and applied on L9780 INRC pin is a function of the parameter of the sensor and
      gives information about how much the λ parameter is far from the target value. The final
      purpose is to obtain λ =1, that in terms of electrical parameters means to have 450 mV as
      output of the reference cell (and applied on INRC pin). In the device this pin is the input of
      an amplifier (INRC amplifier) with gain selectable via SPI (using bit INRCGAIN). The output
      of this amplifier is one of the multiplexed inputs of the A/D converter (in order to give the μP
      the estimation of the λ parameter of the sensor via SPI) and is also internally connected by
      a switch (INRC switch) to C1A or C1B pin and the external compensation network. The
      selection of channel A or B is possible using bit COMPSEL. Electrical parameters of INRC
      amplifier and INRC switches are specified in Table 10.
      On INRC pin is present a diagnostic circuitry able to detect short to battery/ground
      conditions and communicate it via SPI (bits STBS2 and STGRC of SPI output register);
      short to battery detection is always enabled, while the short to ground detection is disabled
      by default; it can be enabled using bit STGINRC. INRC short to battery/ground thresholds
      typical values are 3.2 V and 200 mV (possible ranges are defined in Table 13). The
      consequences of the detection of each one of these faults are described in Section 5.1 and
      5.2.
      The INRC pin is connected to the clean current generator: it is a pull-up current source used
      to clean the air reference of the sensor; the generated current value is selectable via SPI
      (using bits CCS[3..0]). Possible clean current values are specified in Table 10.
      On the same pin a 500 μA pull-down current source is also available, used in order to
      prevent the presence of false short to battery detection due to capacitive commutations. The
      activation of this current is selectable via SPI (bit INRCPD); pull-down current range is
      specified in Table 10.
      A detailed bit description is present in Section 6.3 and 6.4.

Main functionalities                                                                                   L9780
4.6         Pin RCT1 – RCT2 functionalities: RCT2 amplifier, RCT1
            switch, RCT1 band-gap switch
            RCT2 pin is the input of an amplifier with typical gain 4.2 (electrical characteristics of RCT2
            amplifier are specified in Table 10). The output of this amplifier is evaluated during the
            impedance test and converted in order to communicate its value via SPI to the μP: the value
            of RCT2 amplifier output, measured in 2 different conditions (with RCT1 switch open and
            closed), can in fact give a feedback about the impedance of the reference cell, and
            consequently about the temperature of the sensor.
            RCT1 pin is connected through a switch (RCT1 switch) to ground and through another
            switch (RCT1 band-gap switch) to the band-gap voltage; both these functions are used
            during the reference cell impedance test, in particular the second one is used to restore the
            correct charge of the reference cell after the impedance test (charge balance mechanism).
            RCT1 switches resistance range and RCT1 voltage during charge balance are specified in
            Table 10. For the time diagram of the sequence and the related description see
            Section 4.12. Values of external components connected to pins RCT1 and RCT2 are
            specified in Table 19.
4.7         Pin C1A, C2A, C1B, C2B, C3 functionalities: compensation
            network connection
            These pins are used to connect externally the compensation network to the device; via SPI
            (using COMPSEL bit) it is possible to select the desired channel (A or B) and connect the
            external network to the pins C1(A or B), C2(A or B) and C3. The pins of the non selected
            channel are in high impedance state. C1 is internally connected to the output of INRC
            amplifier through the INRC switch (driven by the logic during the impedance test, for details
            see Section 4.12), while C2 and C3 are internally connected to the inverting input and the
            output of an integrator amplifier (C3 is also the VCCS control voltage pin). The non inverting
            input of the amplifier is connected to REF voltage (typ 1.89 V). The integrator amplifier and
            the VCCS create a loop (with the external compensation network) of a PI controller. When
            the loop reaches a stable condition ( = 1), on INRC pin there are 450 mV (if 4.2 gain for
            INRC amplifier is selected), while the inputs of integrator amplifier are both to 1.89 V
            (450 mV * 4.2). In this condition there is no output current from the VCCS cell (2.5 V on C3
            pin).
            The values of the external components that must be used in compensation network depend
            on the sensor that will be driven by the device.
            Two examples of possible compensation networks (with defined external components
            values) are shown below.

      Typical ranges for integrator amplifier electrical parameters are specified in Table 15.
4.8   Pin FV, FVOUT functionalities: FVOUT amplifier
      C3 pin voltage is the VCCS direct input control voltage. Thanks to the presence of the
      external capacitor on FV pin (CFV, specified in Table 19) and the internal resistance RFV
      (typical value 5 kΩ and possible range specified in Table 11), on FV pin the low pass filtered
      C3 voltage can be measured. FV voltage is the input of the FVOUT amplifier used to provide
      on FVOUT pin a signal range compatible with an external A/D converter, as follows:
                                     FVOUT = REF2 + G * (FV – REF2)
      Where G is the gain of VOUT amplifier selectable via SPI (using bits SAMP[2..0]) among the
      following values: 1 - 1.5 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 8 – 12. A sample and hold circuitry and the offset
      compensation technique are used in the architecture of FVOUT amplifier; for this cell all the
      electrical parameters are specified in Table 10 and Table 15.
4.9   Pin TG1, TG2, OUT1, OUT2, SNS functionalities: the VCCS
      TG1, TG2, OUT1, OUT2, SNS are the interface pins between VCCS structure and the
      external pump cell. The pump cell allows to control the oxygen concentration by forcing an
      electric current through the cell itself; in other words it is possible to control the direction and
      the intensity of oxygen transport, because it is directly related to the direction and the
      intensity of the current. By controlling the amount of current through the pump cell, it is
      possible to control the amount of oxygen and consequently the λ parameter of the sensor;
      closing this mechanism into a loop, like in L9780, it is possible to regulate the pump cell
      current in order to obtain the target λ = 1. The best working condition for the sensor is the
      high temperature; in this condition the AC impedance of the pump cell can be assumed to
      be a large capacitance in series to with a resistor of about 20-30 Ω. When cold, the pump
      cell can be assumed to be an open circuit.

            VCCS is a voltage controlled current source and is able to sink or source current from the
            pump cell, depending on its control voltage, that is the voltage present on C3 pin. Through
            TG and OUT pins there is the VCCS output current flow, while SNS is a sense pin. VCCS
            present in L9780 has 2 output channels (1 and 2), selectable via SPI (using bit VCCSOUT);
            TG and OUT pins of the non selected channel are in high impedance condition. In VCCS
            architecture there are 2 internal switches (TG switches) able to short OUT and TG pins of
            the selected channel (see Figure 6); the actuation of these switches can be selected via SPI
            (using bit TGEN).

            If the switch is in off condition the TG pin of the selected channel is in high impedance state.
            If the TG switch is in on state the output current of VCCS structure can flow both through TG
            and OUT pins and can be described with the following expression:
                                                   Iout = - (C3 – REF2)/Rtot
            where Rtot is the external total resistance, that can be obtained as a combination of all the
            external resistances connected to the VCCS pins. Referring to Figure 6, Rtot can be
            calculated as follows:
                                              Rtot = Rout // (Rtg + TAG resistor)
            where Rtg and Rout are the series resistances of the VCCS pins related to the selected
            channel.
            Otherwise, if TG switch is in off state, Rtot = Rout and consequently the VCCS output current
            can be described with the following expression:
                                                   Iout = - (C3 – REF2)/Rout
            The VCCS characteristic is shown in Figure 7. In this figure the relationship between SNS
            voltage and the voltage on Rtot resistance (that is equal to the difference between OUT
            voltage and SNS voltage) is defined; these two quantities are in agreement in sign as both

      At the startup of the device, VCCS structure is disabled by default, that means that all its
      pins are in high impedance condition and the “parking functionality” is active; in other words,
      the parking amplifier is switched on and a voltage similar to REF2 is present on C3 pin (see
      block diagram in Figure 2). Besides, a pull-down resistor is internally connected by default
      from OUT1 pin to GNDA; this is done to avoid that a leakage current can increase the
      voltage value of VCCS pins until the short to battery condition. When VCCS is enabled or a
      sensor short to battery condition is detected, the pull-down resistor is automatically
      disconnected from OUT1 pin; when VCCS is disabled and no fault conditions are present,
      VCCS pull-down resistor can be re enabled via SPI (using bit VCCSPD).
      If no sensor short to battery condition is present, VCCS structure can be enabled and the
      output channel selected with an SPI frame (using bits VCCSEN and VCCSOUT); in this
      case the “parking functionality” is disabled. When VCCS is enabled, it is also possible to
      activate/deactivate clamp functionality via SPI (using bit CLAMPEN), in order to protect the
      sensor; when the clamp functionality is activated, a voltage control is enabled on SNS pin
      and, if its value is going to exceed the voltage range defined by the user, the clamp circuit
      intervenes in order to modify the VCCS output current and make SNS pin reenter the clamp
      limits. The clamp limit range can be symmetric or asymmetric; the desired kind of range can
      be defined via SPI (bit CLAMPSIM). In case of symmetric range, if VCL is the clamp voltage
      defined by the user, the consequent range allowed for SNS voltage is:
                                  -VCL < SNS < +VCL, with 0.75V<VCL<2V
      In case of asymmetric range, if VCL is the clamp voltage defined by the user, the
      consequent range for SNS voltage is:
                           -0.8333*VCL < SNS < +VCL, with 0.75 V < VCL < 2.4 V
      If the clamp circuit is activated and intervenes while VCCS is working, it is visible also via
      SPI because CLAMP bit in SO register is kept = 1 until the clamp circuit is acting during
      VCCS activation. The clamp voltage VCL is defined by the user and is equal to the voltage
      applied on CL1 or CL2 pin; the input channel chosen to read the clamp voltage can be
      selected via SPI (bit CLAMPCL); the non selected pin can be left open.

Main functionalities                                                                                   L9780
            On all VCCS pins a short to battery diagnostic is always active: a short to battery condition
            is detected if OUT or TG pins exceed VCCA voltage + 30 mV or if SNS pin exceed STBS3
            threshold voltage (2.7 V typical value, possible range defined in ). The consequences of a
            short to battery fault detection are specified in Section 5.1.
            On SNS pin is also present a short to ground diagnostic circuitry, that is able to detect if SNS
            pin is into the range SNS_NTH < SNS < SNS_PTH (SNS_NTH and SNS_PTH are voltage
            thresholds specified in Table 13, their typical values are -200 mV and 200 mV). The
            consequences of a sensor short to ground detection are specified in Section 5.3.
            VCCS is designed to respect specification of minimum bandwidth (100 kHz) for different Rtot
            values and is able to guarantee in all conditions a minimum phase margin of 60°. This is
            possible thanks to the programmability of the VCCS internal compensation capacitances
            (Cint). In SPI input frame, 6bit for capacitance configuration are present (VCCSCAP[5..0]);
            these bits allow to drive the connection of internal compensation capacitances, that in this
            way are selectable by the user. The higher is the value of capacitance selected and the
            higher is the phase margin of the structure, but the lower is the consequent bandwidth; with
            some simplifications the bandwidth of VCCS can be described with the following formula:
                                       Ft = (Gm_in * Gm_outDC * Rtot)/ (2π * Cint)
            where Gm_in * Gm_outDC is a constant parameter depending by on the structure used in
            the design; Rtot is the external total resistance and Cint the internal selectable capacitance.
            In the following table it is shown that a wide range of possible Rtot can be driven obtaining
            the correct compromise between bandwidth and phase margin.

            > 100 kHz.
            In order to avoid that during the activation of VCCS for a short time the output current can be
            out of control, the selection or the change of different functionalities of VCCS (like the
            change of output channel, of input clamp or of Cint capacitances) are possible only when
            VCCS is disabled. Well defined rules have to be respected in order to be able to drive
            correctly VCCS; these rules are specified in Section 5.5.2.
            All VCCS electrical parameters ranges are specified in sections Table 12 and Table 15. All
            the logic signals used to select VCCS functionalities are defined in detail in section 7.3.
4.10        Pin PG1, PG2, SR functionalities
            The device is able to drive via SPI (through bits PG1EN, PG2EN) the gate of the external
            protection FET, that can be connected to PG1 or PG2 pin. This external FET acts as a
            switch that connects to ground the second terminal of the pump cell and completes the path
            for VCCS output current (see block diagram in Figure 2). In this condition SR pin voltage is
            expected to be low; if the voltage value exceeds STBS1 threshold (typical value of 200mV
            and possible range specified in Table 13), a sensor short to battery condition is detected.
            For the consequences of this detection see Section 5.1.
            In order to avoid the possibility that the external FET switch on when the device is
            un-powered the FET driver has 100 k (typ) pull down resistor permanently connected to
            PG1 and PG2 pins. Electrical parameters of PG driver are specified in Table 12 and
            Table 15.

4.11  Analog to digital conversion
      In the device a 10bit A/D converter is present. The analog voltages to be converted are
      multiplexed by the logic while the state machine is running and are: the output of RCT2
      amplifier, the output of INRC amplifier and FV pin voltage (see block diagram in Figure 2).
      Between the analog inputs and the A/D converter a scaling amplifier is present; this cell is
      able to amplify the input signal according to the gain selected via SPI (using bit SAMP[2..0])
      with the following relation:
                               OUTsa = REF2 + G * (Input_voltage – REF2)
      where G is the gain selectable via SPI among the following values: 1 - 1.5 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 8 –
      12, and OUTsa is the output of the scaling amplifier (and the input of A/D converter). When
      the selected input of the scaling amplifier is the output of the INRC or RCT2 amplifier, G is
      fixed (=1), while when the input is FV voltage the gain G can be modified by the user. The
      multiplexing sequence at the input of the scaling amplifier when the state machine is running
      is shown in Figure 8.
      The absolute conversion accuracy compared to an ideal transfer curve is ±2 counts. All the
      electrical parameters regarding the scaling amplifier and the A/D conversion are specified in
      Table 11.
      The nominal conversion of the scaling amplifier output is defined in the following formula:
                                                          OUTsa

      where:
           count_SA is the result of the A/D conversion;
           OUTsa is the output voltage of the scaling amplifier;
           floor: a function that returns the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument.

            The A/D conversion results give an indication about the  parameter of the sensor (that is in
            relation with INRC pin voltage), about the VCCS output current (from FV voltage evaluation)
            and about the sensor temperature (from the double conversion of the output of RCT2
            amplifier the external μP is able to evaluate the impedance of the reference cell and
            consequently the temperature).
            All times are defined in Table 16; some of them (the state machine clock period (Tsmc), the
            duration of RCT1 switch and band-gap switch pulses (tR and tB) and the second portion of
            INRC switch pulse (tINRC)) can be defined by SPI (using bits MCP[1..0], ITPT[6..0],
            CBT[6..0], ISPT[2..0]), while the first portion of INRC switch pulse is determined by the
            summation of different events. The SPI selectable variables can not change during the
            measurement; if any change occurs while a measurement is on going, the new values will
            be applied in the next measurement cycle.
            In SO output frame, 3 bits are dedicated to the measurement cycle counter (COUNT[2..0]);
            the value measured by the counter is cleared after every power on reset, is automatically
            incremented by one at every falling edge of measurement clock and latched in SO output

      measurement is able to operate in free running or synchronized mode, according to SPI
      selection (bit SNC); if free running mode is selected, the timing state machine is
      continuously running, otherwise if synchronized mode is selected the measurement cycle

4.13  Pin HD, HG functionalities: heater FET driver and diagnostic
      As shown in the block diagram of Figure 2, HG pin is externally connected to the gate of the
      external heater FET (an NMOS in low-side configuration, with the drain directly connected
      to the heater element), while HD is connected to the drain through the external resistance
      RHD (possible range for this resistor is specified in Table 19).
      The heater is necessary in order to make the sensor work at a correct temperature. The
      sensor can only operate in high temperature conditions, but as it is not able to reach the
      desired range of temperature passively, an active heater is usually incorporated into the
      sensor structure. This heater is normally composed by an ohmic resistor through which the
      heater FET current is forced. The μP is able to obtain information regarding the sensor
      temperature from the results of the impedance test performed into the device and
      communicated to the μP via SPI (the higher is the sensor temperature, the lower is its
      impedance); consequently, the μP can intervene on sensor temperature acting on PW pin.
      PW is a digital input pin of the device and can be driven with a PWM signal by the μP. PW
      pin signal is then internally inverted by the logic and the consequent signal is then applied
      on HG pin, conditioning the activation/deactivation of the external heater FET (and so the
      power consumption necessary to heat the sensor).
      Capacitive coupling due to heater commutations can cause undesired signals on the
      reference cell; in order to avoid it, the logic freezes the current state of HG signal during the
      measurement cycle. HG status will be driven again by PW signal once the measurement
      cycle is completed.
      In order to avoid that the external FET switches on when VIGN voltage is present but the
      device is un-powered, a 100 kΩ pull-down resistor is permanently connected to HG pin.
      A diagnostic circuitry is also present into the heater driver, in order to detect open circuit,
      short to ground or short to battery fault conditions; the logic into the device can
      communicate via SPI to the μP the fault detection through OCH, STGH, STBH bit status.
      The actions related to the diagnostic fault detection are described in Section 5.4, while all
      the heater diagnostic thresholds are specified in Table 13. More details about the heater
      diagnostic bits can be found in Section 6.4.

5          Diagnostic
5.1        Sensor short to battery
           L9780 is able to detect and take actions when a short to battery condition happens on its
           sensor pins. In particular voltage levels on pins INRC, SNS, SR, OUT1/2 and TG1/2 are
           controlled. If INRC, SNS or SR pin exceeds the corresponding voltage threshold reported in
           Table 13 (or one of TG/OUT pins exceeds VCCA + 30 mV), a possible sensor short to
           battery condition is detected. Sensor short to battery diagnostic on SR pin is not active when
           both PG1 and PG2 are OFF.
           Possible sensor short to battery condition is confirmed by the logic (and reported in the SPI
           output register) and the failure countermeasures are applied in the device only if the
           duration of the fault is greater than a filter time defined as a multiple of the clock period
           (possible filter times ranges are defined in Table 17); in other words, when the possible
           sensor short to battery condition is detected, a logic counter starts and when the count
           reaches the value defined in Table 17 the fault condition is considered validated. This
           counter is reset when the possible short to battery fault is cleared and after every power on
           reset.
           As soon as a possible sensor short to battery condition is detected the VCCS pull-down
           resistor is disabled immediately, without waiting any filter time; the pull-down will be
           re enabled once the short to battery condition is removed and the SPI bits are cleared by the
           user.
           Actions
           Once the sensor short to battery fault is validated (the duration of possible fault is greater
           than the filter time) the following actions are taken:
           1. Latch off PG1 and PG2;
           2. Disable VCCS output current (all VCCS pins are in high impedance condition),
                 impedance test and charge balance switches;
           3. Set the STBS1/ STBS2/ STBS3 bit in the SPI output register, according to the pin
                 where the fault has been detected (STBS3 in case of TG/OUT pins).
           These actions remain valid until cleared by the user.
           During short to battery condition, all pins compatible with this fault have to respect the
           leakage current consumption specified in Table 14.
           When the short to battery condition is cleared, VCCS, impedance test and charge balance
           switches may be re enabled asynchronously from VCCS clock if their enable bits are =1. In
           order to avoid this situation these functions should be disabled via SPI when a short to
           battery fault is reported. When the fault is de asserted, these functions can be re enabled via
           SPI.
           For more details about SPI bits see Section 6.4.
5.2        INRC pin short to ground
           The device is able to detect and take actions when a short to ground condition happens on
           INRC pin. This detection is active only if STGINRC bit in SPI input register is set =1 and only
           if the impedance test switch is disabled.

L9780                                                                                         Diagnostic
      If INRC pin is below the corresponding voltage threshold reported in Table 13, a possible
      short to ground condition is detected. Possible short to ground condition is confirmed by the
      logic (and reported in the SPI output register) only if the duration of the fault is greater than
      a filter time, defined as a multiple of the clock period; in other words, when the possible
      sensor short to ground condition is detected, a logic counter starts and when the count
      reaches the value defined inTable 17, the fault condition is considered validated. This
      counter is reset when the possible short to ground fault is cleared and after every power on
      reset.
      Actions
      Once the INRC short to ground fault is validated (the duration of possible fault is greater
      than the filter time) the following action is taken:
      1. Set the STGRC bit in the SPI output register.
      This action remains valid until cleared by the user.
5.3   SNS pin short to ground
      The device is able to detect and take actions when a short to ground condition happens on
      SNS pin.
      If SNS pin is in the range SNS_NTH < SNS < SNS_PTH (SNS_NTH, SNS_PTH thresholds
      values reported in Table 13), a possible short to ground condition is detected. Possible short
      to ground condition is confirmed by the logic (and reported in the SPI output register) only if
      the duration of the fault is greater than a filter time, defined as a multiple of the clock period;
      in other words, when the possible sensor short to ground condition is detected a logic
      counter starts and when the count reaches the value defined in Table 17, the fault condition
      is considered validated. This counter is reset when the possible short to ground fault is
      cleared and after every power on reset.
      Actions
      Once the SNS short to ground fault is validated (the duration of possible fault is greater than
      the filter time) the following action is taken:
      1. Set the STGSNS bit in the SPI output register.
      This action remains valid until cleared by the user.
      Application note
      When the regulation loop is approaching the condition  =1, that in terms of electrical
      parameters means to have 450 mV as output of the reference cell (applied on INRC pin), the
      output current of the VCCS is very small so the voltage of SNS is near to GND. This does not
      flag a fault condition but the STGSNS bit in the SPI output register is expected to be set.
5.4   Heater diagnostic
      The device is able to detect and take actions when a fault condition happens on external
      heater FET, connected to the device through HG and HD pins. Detected fault conditions are:
      heater short to battery, heater short to ground, heater open circuit.

           From a design point of view, to HD pin are connected an 80 μA sink current generator
           (normally on, except for particular diagnostic conditions) and a 190 μA source current
           generator (normally off, except for particular diagnostic conditions); possible ranges for
           generated currents are specified in Table 13.
5.4.1      Heater short to battery
           When the external heater is in “on” condition, the heater drain is expected to be low (the
           external heater is considered “on” when the HG voltage value is higher than a specific
           threshold, defined in Table 13, typical value 4V). If the heater drain voltage value is higher
           than the heater short to battery threshold (selectable via SPI using bit STBHTH, as defined
           in Table 13), a possible heater short to battery condition is detected. Possible heater short to
           battery condition is confirmed by the logic (and reported in the SPI output register) only if the
           duration of the fault is greater than a filter time, defined as a multiple of the clock period; in
           other words, when the possible heater short to battery condition is detected, a logic counter
           starts and when the count reaches the value defined in Table 17 (and selectable via SPI
           using bit STBHFT[1..0]) the fault condition is considered validated. This counter is reset
           when the possible short to battery fault is cleared and after every power on reset.
           Actions
           Once the heater short to battery fault is validated (the duration of possible fault is greater
           than the filter time) the following actions are taken:
           1. Latch HG off;
           2. Set STBH bit in SPI output register.
           These actions remain valid until cleared by the user.
5.4.2      Heater short to ground
           When the external heater is in “off” condition, the heater drain is expected to be high. If the
           heater drain voltage value is lower than the heater short to ground threshold HSG (3.69 V
           typical value, possible range specified in Table 13), a possible heater short to ground
           condition is detected. Possible heater short to ground condition is confirmed only if the
           duration of the fault is greater than a filter time, defined as a multiple of the clock period; in
           other words, when the possible heater short to ground condition is detected a logic counter
           starts and when the count reaches the value defined in Table 17 the fault condition is
           considered validated. This counter is reset when the possible short to ground fault is cleared
           and after every power on reset.
           Actions
           Once the heater short to ground fault is validated (the duration of possible fault is greater
           than the filter time) the following actions are taken:
           1. Set the STGH bit in SPI output register;
           2. Latch HG off;
           3. Invoke a test of heater open circuit.
           These actions remain valid until cleared by the user or modified after the open circuit test.

5.4.3 Heater open circuit
      The device is able to distinguish between heater FET short to ground and open circuit
      conditions. Once the heater open circuit test is invoked, the following actions are taken:
      1. Turn off HD sink current generator;
      2. Turn on HD source current generator;
      3. If HD voltage value > open circuit threshold (specified in Table 13) a possible heater
           open circuit is detected and immediately validated.
      Actions
      Once the heater open circuit fault is validated the following actions are taken:
      1. Set the OCH bit in SPI output register;
      2. Clear the STGH bit in SPI output register.
      These actions remain valid until cleared by the user.
5.5   SPI diagnostic
      Once a fault condition is reported in the SPI output register but the fault condition is
      removed from the device, the user is able to clear the register and restore the normal
      operative condition. This is possible using the CLEARFLT bit in the SPI input register. The
      effect of this bit is to clear all the latched fault conditions and re enable every previously
      disabled output; on HD pin sink and source currents are restored to their default condition.
      The bit is then internally cleared when the clear operation is completed.
5.5.1 SPI data fault
      The device continuously monitors the data input on SPI register. Bits 14 and 15 (CB0, CB1)
      are the data confirmation bits and if one of their values is different from the expected
      (CB0=0, CB1=1) an SPI data fault is detected and immediately validated.
      Actions
      Once an SPI data fault is validated the following actions are taken:
      1. Ignore the corrupted message;
      2. Assert SPIF1 and de assert SPIF2 bits in the output register; these bits are latched until
           cleared by CLEARFLT;
      3. Set REG bit to ‘0’.

5.5.2      SPI length fault
           Receiving an SPI frame with a length different from [64 + (n*8)] bits is considered an SPI
           length fault, immediately detected and validated.
           Actions
           Once an SPI length fault is validated the following actions are taken:
           1. Ignore the corrupted message;
           2. Assert SPIF1 and de assert SPIF2 bits in the output register; these bits are latched until
                cleared by CLEARFLT;
           3. Set REG bit to ‘0’.
5.5.3      SPI not valid command fault
           Any of the following conditions is considered an SPI not valid command fault:
           1. SPI frame with INRCPD = VCCSEN = 1;
           2. SPI frame with VCCSPD = VCCSEN = 1;
           3. When VCCS is enabled, the SPI frame modifies VCCSOUT, COMPSEL or
                VCCSCAP[5..0] bit status;
           4. When VCCS and clamp are enabled, the SPI frame modifies CLAMPCL or CLAMPSIM
                bit status.
           The fault is validated immediately.
           Actions
           Once an SPI not valid command fault is validated the following actions are taken:
           1. Ignore the corrupted message;
           2. Assert and latch SPIF1 and de assert SPIF2 bits in the output register; these bits are
                latched until cleared by CLEARFLT;
           3. Set REG bit to ‘0’.
5.6        Loss of ground
           L9780 has no loss of ground detection. If one of the grounds exceeds the power on reset
           voltage threshold, the device enters the reset condition. For detailed description see
           Section 4.4.

6     Digital interface description
      L9780 contains a serial peripheral interface (SPI) composed by the serial clock (CLK), serial
      data out (SO), serial data in (SI), chip select (CSN) and is configured as an SPI slave. If
      CSN is asserted and the SPI master continues to issue CLK pulses after the SPI shift
      register is filled, the device shall shift the master’s SI data out on SO output.
      SPI can support a daisy chain configuration, so the external processor can send SPI
      commands to multiple devices without using additional chip select pins, as shown in
      Figure 9 and 10.

6.1                               CSN
                                  CSN pin is used to select the device for serial transfer. If CSN is asserted, SO pin exits its tri
                                  state condition and all status information is latched into SPI shift register; register data are
                                  shifted into SI pin and out from SO pin on each subsequent CLK. If CSN is negated, SO pin
                                  is in tri state condition and the fault register is reloaded (latched) with current filtered status

                                  condition but no fault clear is applied and no status bit changes). An internal 30 μA pull-up
                                  current is present on CSN pin in order to force the negated condition if a pin open circuit is

                                  CLK pin provides to the device the clock signal necessary for serial data transfer. When
                                  CSN is asserted the device latches input data and shall shift output data on CLK rising

      Bit 58: INRCPD
      This bit enables (INRCPD=’1’) or disables (INRCPD=’0’) INRC pull-down current.
      If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify the status of this bit in the middle
      of a measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning of the
      new measurement cycle. The information reported in the output register is the configuration
      used in the last measurement cycle.
      If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify INRCPD and VCCSEN bits at the
      same time, it will perform these two actions in sequence, with a delay between the two
      events. In particular if in the input frame INRCPD=’0’ and VCCSEN =’1’, the device disables
      INRC pull-down before enabling VCCS, viceversa if in the input frame INRCPD=’1’ and
      VCCSEN =’0’, the device disables VCCS before enabling INRC pull-down current.

      INRCGAIN =’1’ => selected 2.1 gain.
      Possible ranges for these gains are specified in section 8.1.2.1.
      If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify the gain of INRC amplifier in the
      middle of a measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning
      of the new measurement cycle. The value of the gain reported in the output register is the
      gain used in the last measurement cycle.
      Default state for this bit after power on reset: 0.
      Bit 55: TGEN
      This bit enables (TGEN=’1’) or disables (TGEN=’0’) VCCS TG switches between TG and
      OUT pins.
      If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify TGEN bit in the middle of a
      measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning of the new
      measurement cycle. TGEN bit value reported in the output register is the value used in the
      last measurement cycle.
      Default state for this bit after power on reset: 0.
      Bit 54: VCCSEN
      This bit enables (VCCSEN=’1’) or disables (VCCSEN=’0’) VCCS cell. When VCCSEN=’0’,
      VCCS is disabled and the “parking functionality” is active, that means that on C3 pin a
      voltage similar to REF2 is present (the range of this voltage is specified in Table 11).

             This bit selects VCCS output channel (and corresponding TG pin) as follows:
              VCCSOUT=’0’ => selected channel 1;
              VCCSOUT=’1’ => selected channel 2.
              If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify VCCSOUT bit in the middle of a

              Bit 46 - 43: CCS[3..0]
             These bits are used to select the clean current source on INRC pin, as specified in Table 10.
              If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify CCS[3..0] bits in the middle of a
              measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning of the new
              measurement cycle. CCS[3..0] bits reported in the output register are the values used in the
              last measurement cycle.
              Default state for these bits after power on reset: 0000.
              Bit 42 - 40: SAMP[2..0]
             These bits are used to select the gain of the scaling and FVOUT amplifiers, as specified in
              Table 11.
              If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify SAMP[2..0] bits in the middle of a
              measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning of the new
              measurement cycle. SAMP[2..0] bits reported in the output register are the values used in
              the last measurement cycle.
              Default state for these bits after power on reset: 000.
              Bit 39 - 34: VCCSCAP[5..0]
             These bits are used to set the compensation capacitance Cint into VCCS cell. 1pF is
              permanently connected as compensation capacitance; to this value the decimal conversion
              of VCCSCAP[5..0] sequence has to be added in order to obtain the total capacitance used
              as compensation, as follows:
              VCCSCAP[5..0] = 000000 => 1 pF
              VCCSCAP[5..0] = 111111 => 64 pF
             The device is able to change compensation capacitance only when the VCCS is disabled.
             The correct selection of Cint depends on the kind of the external resistive network that the
              VCCS has to drive; some rules for a correct selection of Cint capacitance are described in
              Section 4.9.
              For correct use of these bits, refer also to Section 5.5.3.
              Default state for these bits after power on reset: 111111.
              Bit 33 - 32: MCP[1..0]
             These bits are used to set the measurement clock period (Tsmc), as specified in Table 16.
              If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify MCP[1..0] bits in the middle of a
              measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning of the new
              measurement cycle. MCP[1..0] bits reported in the output register are the values used in the
              last measurement cycle.
              When the device is configured in synchronous mode, MCP bit configuration is ignored and
              the status bits reported in SPI output register is 00.
              For the description of the timing sequence refer to Section 4.12.
              Default state for these bits after power on reset: 00.

      If the device receives a configuration ITPT[6..0]=’0011000’ or less (except 0000000), the
      device considers this configuration as ‘0011001’, and shall provide SO response with the
      configuration received from SI, even if is ‘0011000’ or less.
      If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify ITPT[6..0] bits in the middle of a
      measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning of the new
      measurement cycle. ITPT[6..0] bits reported in the output register are the values used in the
      last measurement cycle.
      For the description of the timing sequence refer to Section 4.12.
      Default state for these bits after power on reset: 0000000 (corresponding to disable state).
      Bit 23: SNC
      This bit selects the synchronized mode for the device (when SNC=’1’) or the free running
      mode (when SNC=’0’).
      If the device receives an SPI command in order to set SNC=’1’ bit in the middle of a
      measurement cycle, it terminates the measurement cycle and discards all the temporary
      conversions; then operates in idle configuration until a rising edge on SY pin is detected;
      this is the signal necessary to start a new measurement cycle and to clear the measurement
      counter.
      Default state for this bit after power on reset: 0.
      Bit 22 - 16: CBT[6..0]
      These bits are used to set the RCT1 band-gap switch time pulse duration (tB), as specified
      in Table 16.
      If the device receives an SPI command in order to modify CBT[6..0] bits in the middle of a
      measurement cycle, it stores the new information and applies it at the beginning of the new
      measurement cycle. CBT[6..0] bits reported in the output register are the values used in the
      last measurement cycle.
      For the description of the timing sequence refer to Section 4.12.
      Default state for these bits after power on reset: 0000000.

                                 SO pin is in tri state condition when CSN is negated. When CSN is asserted the MSB is the
                                 first bit and LSB is the last bit of the word transmitted on SO.
                                 SPI output register can be configured to report the configuration status of the device (with
                                 conversion and fault detection results) or can be configured to report an echo of the
                                 previous SPI input sequence. The first solution can be selected setting REG bit to ‘0’; the
                                 second solution can be selected setting REG bit to ‘1’. The output word consists of 64 bit.
                                 Here following the description of the SPI output register in both configurations.

      1. Not defined external components have values depending on the kind of sensor that has to be managed (as
         for compensation network components or VCCS external resistors) or depending on the value defined by
         the user (like for CL voltage dividers). TST pins have to be left open.
      2. It is recommended to use ceramic capacitances and place them as close as possible to the part.
