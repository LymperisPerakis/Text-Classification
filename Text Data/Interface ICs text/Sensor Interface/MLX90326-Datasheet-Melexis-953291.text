MLX90326
Analog 0-5V Sensor Interface IC
9. General Description
The MLX90326 can be used with almost any type of resistive bridge sensor without the need of any additional
signal conditioning.
The differential input signal is offset compensated and amplified to achieve the desired output voltage. With a
coarse gain calibration the MLX90326 can easily accommodate sensor output spans in the 1.8mV/V to 63mV/V
range to achieve 4 V output span. Sensor output offsets up to 97.2mV/V (depending on the sensor output span
and on the desired output offset) can be compensated with the coarse offset calibration to achieve an output
offset in the 0.5V to 4.5V range.
10. Unique Features
Offset canceling
The offset of amplifier DIDO is cancelled by using a chopping mechanism. Also the
amplifier DTS and all sample-and-hold circuits make use of an offset canceling mechanism. This means
that the contribution of the on-chip offsets and offset drifts is negligible compared to the external sensor
offset and offset drift.
Coarse and fine second order calibration of the sensitivity and offset.
The MLX90326 can be calibrated to achieve 4V output span for a sensor output span in the 1.8mV/V to 63mV/V
and can compensate 0.4mV/V to 97.2mV/V input offset depending on the sensor output span and on the desired
MLX90326 output offset voltage. A wide range of sensor sensitivity and offset temperature drift can be
compensated with the second order fine gain and offset calibration.
EEPROM
All the calibration data is stored three times on an EEPROM and a majority voting is done when accessing data.
Parity check is used to diagnose data corruption. After all calibrations parameters were successfully written to
EEPROM, the EEPROM can be locked by sending a ‘Lock EEPROM’ command (see paragraph 6). This is strongly
recommended to avoid in application mode data corruption. For reliability reasons, actually each calibration bit is
stored three times in the EEPROM and the circuit uses a hardware majority voting system when accessing data.

The external temperature sensor is only needed for applications where the temperature surrounding the
customer sensor is different from the temperature surrounding the MLX90326. In the ratio-metric application
mode, to keep the accuracy, the same supply should be used for the customer sensor, the MLX90326 and an ADC
that makes the digital conversion of the analog output signal.
The C1 capacitor value (output) is typically 47nF. Range: 0 – 100nF.
The capacitor C2 on the FLT pin is optional. Typical value = 10nF. Range: 0 – 100nF. It is used to decrease the
noise and set the bandwidth of the system. The decoupling capacitors C3 between the supply and the ground and
C4 between output and supply have a typical value of 47nF.
The external resistor R1 is placed between the TMP pin and the supply. It is used as an external temperature
sensor. The external temperature sensor could be of type Panasonic, ERAS15J103V (R1 = 10k +/- 5%, TCR =
1500ppm/degC +/- 200ppm/degC) for the -40ºC to 140ºC temperature range.
Typical pull up resistor R2 value is 2.4kOhm.

With the use of an external voltage regulator to supply the sensor, the MLX90326 as well as an ADC used for
converting the analog output signal, the MLX90326 can be used in a non ratio-metric mode. An example of
standard voltage regulator is the LM7805. C1, C2, R1 and R2 are the same as in the ratio-metric application
mode. C4 has a typical value of 330nF and C3 of 100nF in this application mode.
