Note 2: All voltages are referenced to GND. Currents entering the IC are specified positive, and currents exiting the IC are negative.
Note 3: All Serial Interface timing specifications are guaranteed by design.
Note 4: Specification is 100% tested at TA = +25°C. Specification limits over temperature (TA = TMIN to TMAX) are guaranteed by
          design and characterization; not production tested.
Note 5: For all pins except T+ and T- (see the Thermocouple Input Bias Current parameter in the Electrical Characteristics table.
Note 6: Using a common-mode voltage other than VBIAS will change this specification. See the Typical Operating Characteristics
          for details.
Note 7: Input-referred full-scale voltage is 78.125mV when AV = 8 and is 19.531mV when AV = 32.
Note 8: Overvoltage and undervoltage limits apply to T+, T-, and BIAS pins.

Internal Registers
Communication with the MAX31856 is accomplished through 16 8-bit registers that contain conversion, status, and
configuration data. All programming is done by selecting the appropriate address of the desired register location. The
Register Memory Map (Table 6) illustrates the addresses for the temperature, status, and configuration registers.
The registers are accessed using the 0Xh addresses for reads and the 8Xh addresses for writes. Data is read from or
written to the registers MSB first. Attempts to write to a read-only register results in no change in the data.

   BIT           NAME                                                    DESCRIPTION
                          Conversion Mode
     7          CMODE     0 = Normally Off mode (default)
                          1 = Automatic Conversion mode. Conversions occur continuously every 100ms (nominal).
                          One-Shot Mode
                          0 = No conversions requested (default)
                          1 = This causes a single cold-junction and thermocouple conversion to take place when Conversion
     6           1SHOT    Mode bit =0 (normally off mode). The conversion is triggered when CS goes high after writing a 1 to
                          this bit. Note that if a multi-byte write is performed, the conversion is triggered when CS goes high
                          at the end of the transaction. A single conversion requires approximately 143ms in 60Hz filter mode
                          or 169ms in 50Hz filter mode to complete. This bit self clears to 0.
                          These bits enable/disable open-circuit fault detection and select fault detection timing.
    5:4      OCFAULT[1:0]
                          See Open-Circuit Fault Detection section and Table 4 for operation of these bits.
                          Cold-Junction Sensor Disable
                          0 = Cold-junction temperature sensor enabled (default)
                          1 = Cold-junction temperature sensor disabled. Data from an external temperature sensor may be
     3             CJ     written to the cold-junction temperature register. When this bit changes from 0 to 1, the most recent
                          cold-junction temperature value will remain in the cold-junction temperature register until the internal
                          sensor is enabled or until a new value is written to the register. The overall temperature conversion
                          time is reduced by 25ms (typ) when this bit is set to 1.
                          Fault Mode
                          0 = Comparator Mode. The FAULT output and respective fault bit reflects the state of any non-
                          masked faults by asserting when the fault condition is true, and deasserting when the fault condition
                          is no longer true. There is a 2°C hysteresis when in comparator mode for threshold fault conditions.
     2           FAULT    (default)
                          1 = Interrupt Mode. The FAULT output and respective fault bit asserts when a non-masked fault
                          condition is true and remain asserted until a 1 is written to the Fault Status Clear bit. This deasserts
                          FAULT and respective fault bit until a new fault is detected (note that this may occur immediately if
                          the fault condition is still in place).
                          Fault Status Clear
                          0 = Default
                          1 = When in interrupt mode, returns all Fault Status bits [7:0] in the Fault Status Register (0Fh) to 0
     1         FAULTCLR
                          and deasserts the FAULT output. This bit has no effect in comparator mode. Note that the FAULT
                          output and the fault bit may reassert immediately if the fault persists. To prevent the FAULT output
                          from reasserting, first set the Fault Mask bits. The fault status clear bit self-clears to 0.
                          50Hz/60Hz Noise Rejection Filter Selection
                          0= Selects rejection of 60Hz and its harmonics (default)
     0          50/60Hz   1= Selects rejection of 50Hz and its harmonics
                          Note: Change the notch frequency only while in the “Normally Off” mode – not in the Automatic
                          Conversion mode.

The Fault Mask Register allows the user to mask faults from causing the FAULT output from asserting. Masked faults
will still result in fault bits being set in the Fault Status register (0Fh). Note that the FAULT output is never asserted by
thermocouple and cold-junction out-of-range status.

Register 0Ah/8Ah: Cold-Junction Temperature Register, MSB (CJTH)
This register contains the MSB of the two-byte (0Ah and 0Bh) value used for cold-junction compensation of the ther-
mocouple measurement. When the cold-junction temperature sensor is enabled, this register is read-only and contains
the MSB of the measured cold-junction temperature plus the value in the Cold-Junction Offset register. Also when the
cold-junction temperature sensor is enabled, a read of this register will reset the DRDY pin high. When the cold-junction
temperature sensor is disabled, this register becomes a read-write register that contains the MSB of the most recent
cold-junction conversion result until a new value is written into it. This allows writing the results from an external tem-
perature sensor, if desired. The maximum contained in the two cold-junction temperature bytes is clamped at 128°C and
the minimum is clamped at -64°C.

Register 0Bh/8Bh: Cold-Junction Temperature Register, LSB (CJTL)
This register contains LSB of the two-byte (0Ah and 0Bh) value used for cold-junction compensation of the thermocouple
measurement. When the cold-junction temperature sensor is enabled, this register is read-only and contains the LSB of
the measured cold-junction temperature plus the value in the Cold-Junction Offset register. Also when the cold-junction
temperature sensor is enabled, a read of this register will reset the DRDY pin high. When the cold-junction temperature
sensor is disabled, this register becomes a read-write register that contains the LSB of the most recent cold-junction
conversion result until a new value is written into it.

Note: When the MAX31856 is set to operate in “comparator” fault mode (set with bit 2 of Configuration 0 register (00h)), the fault
status bits simply reflect the state of any faults by asserting when the fault condition is true, and deasserting when the fault condition
is no longer true.
When in “interrupt” fault mode, the fault status bits assert when a fault condition is true. The bits remain asserted until a 1 is written
to the Fault Status Clear bit. This deasserts the fault bits until a new fault is detected (note that this may occur immediately if the
fault condition is still in place).
