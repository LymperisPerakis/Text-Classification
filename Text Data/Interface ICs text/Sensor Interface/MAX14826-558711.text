Note 2: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Limits over the operating temperature range are guaranteed by
          design.
Note 3: UV is an open-drain output. Connect UV to a voltage less than 5.5V through an external pullup resistor.
Note 4: Disable time measurements are load-dependent.
Note 5: RxFilter is on by default in parallel mode (SPI/PAR is low).

 X = Unknown. These bits are dependent on the DI logic and C/Q inputs.
 The Status register reflects the logic levels of C/Q and DI and shows the source of interrupts that cause an IRQ/CQOC hardware
 interrupt. The IRQ/CQOC interrupt is asserted when an alarm condition (OTemp, UV33Int, UV24, C/QFault, DoFault, WuInt) is
 detected. All bits in the Status register are read-only. The interrupt bits return to the default state after the Status register is read. If
 a C/Q or DO fault condition persists, the associated interrupt bits are immediately set after the Status register is read.

                                              Wake-Up Interrupt Request. WuInt is set when an IO-Link wake-up request pulse is
         D7                    Wulnt          detected on C/Q and the WuIntEn bit in the Mode register is set. IRQ/CQOC asserts when
                                              WuInt is set to 1. Read the Status register to clear the WuInt bit and deassert IRQ/CQOC.
                                              DO Fault Interrupt. DoFaultInt interrupt bit and DoFault bit (in the Mode register) are
                                              set when a fault condition occurs on the DO driver output. The device registers a fault
         D6                 DoFaultInt        condition when a short-circuit or voltage fault is detected on DO (see the DO Fault
                                              Detection section for more information). IRQ/CQOC asserts when DoFaultInt is 1. Read
                                              the Status register to clear the DoFaultInt bit and deassert IRQ/CQOC.
                                              DI Logic Level. The DiLvl bit mirrors the current logic level at the DI input. It is the inverse
         D5                    DiLvl          of the LI output and is always active regardless of the state of the LiDis bit (Table 2). DiLvl
                                              does not affect IRQ/CQOC. DiLvl is not changed when the Status register is read.

                                    C/Q Logic Level. The QLvl bit is the inverse of the logic level at C/Q. QLvl is 1 when the
                                    C/Q input level is low (< 8V) and is 0 when the C/Q logic level is high (> 13V) (Table 3).

                                    QLvl remains active when the C/Q receiver output, RX is disabled (RxDis = 1). QLvl does
                                    not affect IRQ/CQOC. QLvl is not changed when the Status register is read.
                                    C/Q Fault Interrupt. The C/QFaultInt interrupt bit and C/QFault bit (in the Mode register)
                                    are set when a short-circuit or voltage fault occurs on the C/Q driver output (see the C/Q
       D3               C/QFaultInt
                                    Fault Detection section for more information). IRQ/CQOC asserts when C/QFault is 1.
                                    Read the Status register to clear the C/QFaultInt bit and deassert IRQ/CQOC.
                                    Internal 3.3V LDO (LDO33) Undervoltage Warning. Both the UV33Int interrupt bit and
                                    the UV33En bit (in the Mode register) are set when VLDO33 falls below the 2.4V LDO33
                                    undervoltage threshold. If UV33En is set in the Mode register, IRQ/CQOC asserts low
       D2                UV33Int    when the UV33Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV33Int bit and deassert
                                    IRQ/CQOC. Set the UV33En bit to 1 in the Mode register to enable undervoltage
                                    monitoring for UV33Int. When enabled, UV asserts high when the UV33Int bit is 1. UV
                                    deasserts when VLDO33 rises above the LDO33 undervoltage threshold.
                                    VCC Undervoltage Interrupt. The UV24Int interrupt bit and the UV24 bit (in the Mode
                                    register) are set when the VCC voltage falls below the 7.4V undervoltage threshold.
       D1                UV24Int
                                    IRQ/CQOC asserts low when the UV24Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the
                                    UV24Int bit and deassert IRQ/CQOC. VCC undervoltage detection cannot be disabled.
                                    Overtemperature Warning. The OTempInt interrupt bit and the OTemp bit (in the Mode
                                    register) are set when a high-temperature condition is detected by the devices. OTemp
                                    is set when the temperature of the die exceeds +127°C (typ). OTempInt is set and IRQ/
       D0                OTempInt   CQOC asserts when the OTemp bit is 1. The OTempInt bit is cleared and IRQ/CQOC
                                    deasserts when the Status register is read.
                                    Once cleared, OTempInt is not reset if the die temperature remains above the thermal
                                    warning threshold and does not fall below +104°C.

                                              C/Q and DI Receiver Filter Control. The C/Q and DI receivers have analog
                                              lowpass filters to reduce high-frequency noise on the receiver inputs. Set the
                                              RxFilter bit to 0 to set the filter corner frequency to 500kHz. Set the RxFilter
          D7                   RxFilter
                                              bit to 1 to set the filter corner frequency to 1MHz (this setting is used for
                                              high-speed COM3 operation). Noise filters on C/Q and DI are controlled
                                              simultaneously by the RxFilter bit.
          D6                     —            This bit is not used.
                                              C/Q Driver NPN/PNP Mode. The C/Q_N/P bit selects between low-side (NPN)
                                              and high-side (PNP) modes when the C/Q driver is configured as an open-drain
          D5                  C/Q_N/P
                                              output (C/Q_PP = 0). Set C/Q_N/P to 1 to configure the driver for low-side
                                              (NPN) operation. Set C/Q_N/P to 0 for high-side (PNP) operation.
                                              C/Q Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set C/Q_PP to 1 to enable push-pull
          D4                   C/Q_PP
                                              operation on the C/Q driver. The C/Q output is open-drain when C/Q_PP is 0.
                                              C/Q Driver Enable/Disable. Set the C/QDEn bit to 1 to enable the C/Q driver.
          D3                   C/QDEn
                                              Set C/QDEn to 0 for hardware (TXEN) control. See Table 4.
                                              C/Q Driver Output Logic. The Q bit can be used to program the C/Q output
                                              driver through software. The C/Q driver must be enabled and TX must be high
                                              to control the C/Q driver through the Q bit (Figure 9). C/Q has the same logic
                                              polarity as the Q bit.

                                              Set the Q bit to 0 to control the C/Q driver with TX.
                                              The C/Q driver output state depends on the C/Q_PP and C/Q_N/P bits as
                                              shown in Table 5. Note that Table 5 assumes that the C/Q driver is enabled
                                              (TXEN = VL or C/QDEn = 1).
                                              C/Q Receiver Enable/Disable. Set the RxDis bit to 1 to disable the C/Q
          D1                    RxDis
                                              receiver. The RX output is high when RxDis is 1.

            BIT                   NAME                                             DESCRIPTION
                                                    DO Output Polarity. Set the DoInv bit to 1 to invert the logic of the DO
                                                    output. This bit also works in conjunction with the DoAv (Table 6). DO
            D7                     DoInv
                                                    tracks the TX input with the opposite polarity when both the DoAv and
                                                    DoInv bits are set.
                                                    DO Antivalent Operation. Set the DoAv bit to 1 to enable antivalent
                                                    output operation on DO. DO tracks the TX input (and the Q bit) when
            D6                     DoAv             DoAv is 1 (Table 6).
                                                    The LO input and the DoBit are ignored when the DoAv bit is 1.
                                                    DO Driver NPN/PNP Operation. The DoN/P bit selects between low-
                                                    side (NPN) and high-side (PNP) modes when the DO driver is configured
            D5                    DoN/P             as an open-drain output (DoPP = 0). Set DoN/P to 1 to configure the
                                                    driver for low-side (NPN) operation. Set DoN/P to 0 for high-side (PNP)
                                                    operation.
                                                    DO Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set the DoPP bit to 1 to configure the
            D4                     DoPP             DO driver output for push-pull operation. DO is an open-drain output
                                                    when DoPP is 0.
                                                    DO Driver Enable/Disable. Set the DoEn bit to 1 to enable the DO driver.

                                                    The DO driver is high-impedance with a weak pulldown when DoEn is 0.
                                                    DO Driver Output Logic. The DoBit bit can be used to program the
                                                    DO output driver through software. Drive LO high to activate DoBit

                                                    that Table 7 assumes that the DoInv bit is 0.
                                                    LI Output Enable/Disable. Set the LiDis bit to 1 to disable the LI output.

                                                    The LI output is low when LiDis is 1.

                                       When WuIntEn is set, the WuInt bit in the Status register is set and IRQ/CQOC asserts
         D6                WuIntEn     when a valid wake-up condition is detected. The C/Q driver must be enabled for wake-up
                                       detection. The state of WuIntEn does not affect the WU/THSD output.

                                       and DoFaultInt bits are both set when a fault occurs on DO. DoFault is cleared when the
                                       fault is removed.
                                       C/Q Fault Status. The C/QFault bit is set when a short circuit or voltage fault occurs at
                                       the C/Q driver output (see the C/Q Fault Detection section for more information). The C/

                                       QFault and C/QFaultInt bits are both set when a fault occurs on C/Q. C/QFault is cleared
                                       when the fault is removed.
                                       VCC Undervoltage Condition. Both the UV24 and the UV24Int bits are set when VCC
         D3                 UV24       falls below VCCUVLO. UV24 is cleared when VCC rises above the VCC threshold. V5
                                       must be present for SPI VCC undervoltage monitoring.
                                       Temperature Warning. The OTemp bit is set when a high-temperature condition occurs
                                       on the devices. Both the OTempInt interrupt in the Status register and the OTemp bit are
         D2                 OTemp
                                       set when the junction temperature of the die rises to above +127°C (typ). The OTemp bit
                                       is cleared when the junction temperature falls below +104°C (typ).
