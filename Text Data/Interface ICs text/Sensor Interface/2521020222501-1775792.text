Soldering:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             All topics are described in a more detailed manner in the user manual for each product.
• The solder profile must comply with the technical product specifications. All other profiles will void the warranty.
• All other soldering methods are at the customers’ own risk.
Cleaning and Washing:
• Washing agents used during the production to clean the customer application might damage or change the characteristics of the
       component. Washing agents may have a negative effect on the long-term functionality of the product.
• Using a brush during the cleaning process may damage the component. Therefore, we do not recommend using a brush during the PCB
       cleaning process.
Potting and Coating:
• Potting material might shrink or expand during and after hardening. This might apply mechanical stress on the components, which can
       influence the characteristics of the transfer function. In addition, potting material can close existing openings in the housing. This can
       lead to a malfunction of the component. Thus, potting is not recommended.
