1       ZSSC3170 Characteristics
1.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings
The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The device might not function or be operable above the
recommended operating conditions given in section 1.2. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might
also damage the device. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating
conditions might affect device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute Maximum Ratings.”
Parameters are valid without time limit unless otherwise noted.

2     Circuit Description
2.1 Signal Flow and Block Diagram
The signal path of the ZSSC3170 consists of the analog front end (AFE), the digital signal processing block, and
interfaces including protection circuitry. Based on a differential structure, the bridge inputs VBP and VBN are
handled by two signal lines each with a dynamic range symmetrical to the common mode potential (analog
ground equal to VDDA/2). Therefore it is possible to amplify positive and negative input signals within the
common mode range of the signal input.

The multiplexer (MUX) transmits the signals from either the bridge sensor or the selected temperature sensors to
the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in a defined sequence. The temperature sensor can either be an external or
internal diode or an external thermistor (RTD), selected by EEPROM configuration. In LIN Mode, temperature
output is available. For this temperature measurement, the same temperature sensor can be used as for
calibration temperature, or a second temperature sensor input can be selected. The differential signal from the
bridge sensor is pre-amplified by the programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The ADC converts bridge sensor and
temperature signals into digital values.
The digital signal conditioning takes place in the calibration microcontroller (CMC) using a ROM-resident
conditioning formula and sensor-specific coefficients stored in the EEPROM during calibration. The configuration
data and the correction parameters can be programmed into the EEPROM by digital communication at the output
                2
pins or at the I C™ interface. Depending on the programmed output configuration, the corrected sensor signal is
output as a PWM signal (high-side switch or low-side switch) or as a digital value within a LIN frame. During the
                            2
calibration procedure, the I C™ interface can provide measurement values as well.

  1)    Recommended internal signal range: maximum 80% supply voltage. Range is defined by 80% of supply voltage divided by selected gain.
  2)    At maximum input signal (with XZC: +300% offset).
2.3.2       Offset Compensation
The ZSSC3170 supports two methods of sensor offset compensation:
        Digital offset correction is processed during the digital signal conditioning by the calibration microcontroller
         (CMC).
        Bridge sensor offset compensation (XZC) is achieved by adding a compensation voltage at the analog
         signal path that removes coarse offset. XZC is needed for large offset values that would otherwise
         overdrive the analog signal path, and it can be adjusted by 6 EEPROM bits. Depending on the gain
         adjustment, XZC can handle offset values of up to 300% of the sensor signal range.

2.3.3       Analog-to-Digital Converter
The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is designed in full differential switched capacitor technology with a
selectable resolution of 13 or 14 bits. The ADC can operate in first or second order configuration. The conversion
is largely insensitive to short-term and long-term instabilities of the clock frequency.
     MSB segment conversion: In this first step of the A/D conversion, the measurement value is integrated
        over the complete conversion time ensuring a high degree of noise suppression. To extend the integration
        phase to the maximum, this fraction of the complete conversion time is selected to be as long as possible
        corresponding to the time available.
     LSB segment conversion: To achieve a higher resolution, the residual value of the first step is converted
        in a subsequent step by a second converter. In first-order configuration, the second step is skipped (single-
        step conversion).

     RSADC      ADC range shift adjustable by EEPROM configuration (RSADC = /16, /8, /4, /2 )
By selecting different values of RSADC, the user can match the sensor input signal to the optimum input voltage
range of the ADC. The ADC reference voltage VADC_REF is defined as the difference between the bridge supply
potentials at pins VBR_T and VBR_B. The theoretical ADC input voltage range ADCINP_R is equal to this ADC
reference voltage.
A major constraint required for achieving the specified precision as well as the stability and nonlinearity
parameters of the AFE is to use a maximum ADC input voltage range of 10% to 90% of ADC INP_R within the
application. This is of special importance for ensuring the specified parameters for the entire operating
temperature range as well as all possible sensor bridge tolerances. The validity of these conditions is not checked
by the ZSSC3170’s failsafe functions and therefore must be ensured by the customer-specific configuration.
2.4 Temperature Measurement
The following temperature sensors are supported by ZSSC3170 for both temperature and calibration temperature
measurement:
      Internal pn-diode
      External pn-diode; anode to pin VBR_T
      External resistive half-bridge with the thermistor connected in the upper branch
In PWM Mode, the conditioning calculation for the bridge sensor signal is based on values of the selected
temperature sensor.
In LIN Mode, two temperature measurements are executed using either two different sensors or one sensor for
both measurements. The temperature output value is the result of a conditioning calculation including offset
                                          nd
compensation, gain correction, and 2 order nonlinearity compensation. The conditioning coefficients are stored
in the EEPROM.

2.5 System Control and Conditioning Calculation
The system control performs the following tasks:
      Sequencing of the start-up phase
      Control of measurement cycle based on EEPROM configuration data
      16-bit conditioning calculation for each measurement signal based on EEPROM conditioning coefficients
       and ROM-resident signal conditioning algorithm
      Processing of communication requests received at the serial interfaces
      Control of calibration mode
      Processing of diagnostic and failsafe tasks
For a detailed description, refer to the ZSSC3170 Functional Description.
2.5.1      Operating Modes
Three main modes are implemented in the integrated state machine:
      Normal Operation Mode (NOM) with continuous signal conditioning
      Command Mode (CM), which provides access to all internal registers and provides the basis for
       configuration and calibration of the ZSSC3170
      Diagnostic Mode (DM), which indicates detected error conditions
2.5.2      Start-Up Phase
The start-up phase consists of the following time periods:
      Settling of the internal voltage supply represented by the voltage VDDA-VSSA. At the end of this period,
       the power-on-reset circuit (POR) switches off the reset signal.
      System start, readout of EEPROM, and signature check.
      Processing of the signal conditioning start routine containing bridge sensor signal and temperature
       measurements, associated auto-zero measurements, and the conditioning calculation itself. Within this
       period, the output pins are ready to receive special LIN frames resulting in entering the Command Mode
       (CM). This start window is active for up to 30ms.
The ZSSC3170 switches into Normal Operation Mode (NOM) after the start window is passed. It proceeds with
the cyclic processing of the measurement and conditioning tasks.

                                                                                               ZSSC3170 Datasheet
2.5.3      Measurement Cycle
Depending on the EEPROM settings, the multiplexer selects the following inputs in a defined sequence:
      Pre-amplified sensor bridge signal
      Temperature sensor defined by EEPROM configuration for calibration temperature
     Temperature sensor defined by EEPROM configuration for temperature measurement
     Auto-zero signal
     Diagnostic signals
The CMC controls the complete measurement cycle following a basic flow shown in Figure 2.2.
All necessary measurements for bridge sensor and temperature signal are executed once after power-on within
the start-up routine. This initial phase is followed by continuous processing of the complete measurement cycle.
The sensor connection check (SCC), sensor short check (SSC), and sensor aging check (SAC) for diagnostic
tasks (see section 2.8) are continuously executed within the regular measurement cycle even if the processing of
the diagnostic function is disabled by the EEPROM configuration.
For details, refer to the ZSSC3170 Functional Description.

2.5.4      Conditioning Calculation
After digital auto-zero correction of the bridge sensor measurement value, the interim result is further processed
                                                                                      nd
based on the correction formula. Offset and gain with temperature effects up to 2 order and non-linearity up to
  rd
3 order can be compensated for, resulting in a positive 15-bit bridge sensor result value normalized to the range
of [0;1].
In LIN Mode, the digital measurement value of the temperature is processed based on a proprietary correction
                                                          nd
formula as well. Offset, gain, and non-linearity up to 2 order can be compensated for yielding a positive 15-bit
temperature value normalized to the range of [0;1].
2.6 Signal Outputs
ZSSC3170 provides three signal outputs:
      LIN – LIN Interface revision 2.1/2.0 with compatibility to revision 1.3
      HOUT – PWM high-side switch (HSS)
      LOUT – PWM low-side switch (LSS)
For the respective application, one signal output must be selected and configured as the active output. Idle
outputs must be not connected.
To enter the Command Mode (CM), communication can be established at each of the three output pins. A
dedicated command must be sent during the start window immediately after power-on (duration tSTART_WN; see
specification 1.4.2.3). The communication protocol at all pins is based on the LIN Data Link Layer. Note that
communication at the HOUT pin uses the inverted signal levels of the LIN frame. In LIN Mode, communication at
the LIN pin is always possible during Normal Operation Mode (NOM).
To enable communication within the start window, the output drivers are set to tri-state during this time. The
outputs HOUT and LOUT are connected to internal pull-up resistors to ensure the necessary resistive stage. For
the LIN transceiver, an internal pull-up resistor is implemented by default (according to the LIN Specification
Package, Physical Layer section).
If not switched into CM before expiration of the 30ms start window, depending on the configuration, the
ZSSC3170 will start to provide a PWM signal or can respond to communication requests of the LIN master.
The function set of the signal outputs is specified in detail in the following documents: the ZSSC3170 Functional
Description and the ZSSC3170 LIN Interface Description.
Note: LIN Sleep Mode must be disabled for proper PWM operation.
2.6.1      PWM Outputs HOUT and LOUT
In PWM Mode, the output signal is provided at the pins HOUT or LOUT accordingly.
The outputs are protected from short circuit overload by current limiters and time monitoring. Driving the signal
lines with slew-rate-limited edges reduces electromagnetic emission. At the HOUT pin, a voltage higher than the
maximum supply voltage can be tolerated. The notably low leakage current of LOUT is designed to cover the
requirements of some unique electronic control units (ECU).

2.6.2      LIN Output
The output of the integrated LIN transceiver at the LIN pin is compatible with the LIN revisions 2.1, 2.0 and 1.3.
For details, refer to the ZSSC3170 LIN Interface Description. For LIN Physical Layer Conformance Tests, the
control pins of the integrated LIN transceiver can be accessed separately in a LIN Conformance Test Mode.
2.7 Digital Test and Calibration Interface
                                                                                                             2
Beyond the digital communication features accessed via the output pins, the ZSSC3170 provides an I C™ com-
                                                                                                    2
patible test and calibration interface with slave functionality. For a detailed description of the I C™ interface, refer
to the ZSSC3170 Functional Description.
2.8 Diagnostic and Failsafe Features, Watchdog, and Error Detection
The ZSSC3170 detects various possible failures. An identified failure is indicated by the ZSSC3170 entering the
Diagnostic Mode (DM). With PWM active, the respective output is switched to the resistive mode. In LIN Mode,
depending on the error classification, the correlated status bits are activated. A watchdog continuously monitors
the operations of the CMC and the running measurement loop. The operation of the internal clock oscillator is
monitored by the oscillator failure detection. A check of the sensor bridge for broken or shorted wires is performed
continuously (the sensor connection check (SCC) and the sensor short check (SSC). In PWM Mode with Low-
Side Switch (LSS) and PWM Mode with High-Side Switch (HSS), the diagnosis functions SCC and SSC are only
available from ZSSC3170 silicon revision “F” and any subsequent revisions. The common mode voltage of the
sensor (CMV) is monitored continuously (sensor aging check (SAC)). A check for a broken chip (BCC) can be
applied in the start-up phase after power-on. RAM, ROM, EEPROM, registers, and the arithmetic unit are
monitored continuously. Refer to the ZSSC3170 Functional Description for a detailed description.
2.9 High Voltage, Reverse Polarity, and Short Circuit Protection
The ZSSC3170 is designed for a direct 12V supply, which can be provided by a vehicle power system. Internal
sub-assemblies are supplied and protected by integrated voltage regulators and limiters. Specific protection
circuits allow tolerance of permanent reverse polarity at supply and output pins. These functions are described in
detail in the document ZSSC3170 High Voltage Protection Description. When operated in the application circuits
shown in section 3, the protection features of the ZSSC3170 are guaranteed without time limit.
