For ultra-low-power applications, and for the lowest
possible heat dissipation, Maxim Integrated offers a
pin-compatible version of this device, the MAX31912.
The MAX31912 uses patent-pending circuit techniques
to achieve further reduction of power beyond what is
possible by input current limiting alone. Contact the

Note 2:     Limits are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and/or TA = +125°C. Limits over the operating temperature range and
            relevant supply voltage range are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical values are not guaranteed.
Note 3: If a 24V supply is not available, the device can be powered through V5VOUT. In this mode of operation, the VCC24V
            supply must be left unconnected. All other specifications remain identical. The field-supply UV1 and UV2 alarms will be
            activated (set to 1), indicating the absence of the 24V supply in this mode of operation.
Note 4: When using suggested external 2.2kω series resistors, limits of -3V to +36V apply.
Note 5: fIN refers to the maximum pulse frequency (1/fIN = shortest pulse width) that can be detected from the field sensors and
            switches.
Note 6: External resistor RREF can be adjusted to set any desired current limit between 0.5mA and 6mA.
Note 7: See Figure 8.

Note 9: See Figure 7.
Note 10: See Figure 6.
Note 11: This is the maximum bit transfer rate through the serializer interface.

Powering the Device Through the 5VOUT Pin
The device can alternatively be powered using a 5V
supply connected to the 5VOUT pin. In this case a 24V
supply is no longer needed and the VCC24V supply must
be kept unconnected. (see Figure 3)
In this configuration, the device will always indicate
a UVFAULT (UV1 and UV2) and the FAULT pin will
always be active (pulled low). Faults due to the Supply
Voltage monitoring will not be available. Faults due to the
Temperature monitor can only be read through the SPI
interface.
This configuration has lower power consumption and
heat dissipation since the on-chip 5V voltage regulator
is disabled.
