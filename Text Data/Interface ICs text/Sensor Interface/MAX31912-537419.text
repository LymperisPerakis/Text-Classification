Note 2:    Limits are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and TA = +125°C. Limits over the operating temperature range and rel-
           evant supply voltage range are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical values are not guaranteed.
Note 3: If a 24V supply is not available, the device can be powered through V5VOUT. In this mode of operation, the VCC24V sup-
           ply must be left unconnected. All other specifications remain identical. The field-supply UV1 and UV2 alarms will be acti-
           vated (set to 1), indicating the absence of the 24V supply in this mode of operation.
Note 4: When using suggested external 2.2kΩ series resistors, limits of -3V to +36V apply.
Note 5: fIN refers to the maximum pulse frequency (1/fIN = shortest pulse width) that can be detected from the field sensors and
           switches.
Note 6: External resistor RREF can be adjusted to set any desired current limit between 0.5mA and 6mA.
Note 7: See Figure 9.
Note 8: See Figure 6.
Note 9: See Figure 8.
Note 10: See Figure 7.
Note 11: This is the maximum bit transfer rate through the serializer interface.
Note 12: When input current switching is enabled (DB0/DB1 /= 00), there is no Input Threshold Hysteresis. In this case, the Input
           Threshold for both falling and rising signal is the High-to-Low Threshold.

Powering the Device Through the 5VOUT Pin
The device can alternatively be powered using a 5V
supply connected to the 5VOUT pin. In this case a 24V
supply is no longer needed and the VCC24V supply must
be kept unconnected. (see Figure 4)
In this configuration, the device will always indicate
a UVFAULT (UV1 and UV2) and the FAULT pin will
always be active (pulled low). Faults due to the Supply
Voltage monitoring will not be available. Faults due to the
Temperature monitor can only be read through the SPI
interface.
This configuration has lower power consumption and
heat dissipation since the on-chip 5V voltage regulator is
disabled.
