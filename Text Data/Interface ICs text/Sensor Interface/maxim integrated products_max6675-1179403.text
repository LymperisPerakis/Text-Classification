General Description                                         Features
The MAX6675 performs cold-junction compensation and         ●● Direct Digital Conversion of Type -K Thermocouple
digitizes the signal from a type-K thermocouple. The           Output
data is output in a 12-bit resolution, SPI™-compatible,     ●● Cold-Junction Compensation
read-only format.
                                                            ●● Simple SPI-Compatible Serial Interface
This converter resolves temperatures to 0.25°C, allows
readings as high as +1024°C, and exhibits thermocouple      ●● 12-Bit, 0.25°C Resolution
accuracy of 8LSBs for temperatures ranging from 0°C to      ●● Open Thermocouple Detection
+700°C.
The MAX6675 is available in a small, 8-pin SO package.

The accuracy of the MAX6675 is susceptible to power-
supply coupled noise. The effects of power-supply
noise can be minimized by placing a 0.1µF ceramic          Chip Information
bypass capacitor close to the supply pin of the device.    TRANSISTOR COUNT: 6720

Thermal Considerations
Self-heating degrades the temperature measurement
accuracy of the MAX6675 in some applications. The
magnitude of the temperature errors depends on the
thermal conductivity of the MAX6675 package, the
