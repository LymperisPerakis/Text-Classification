Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

Note 2: All devices 100% productions tested at 25°C. Limits over the operating temperature range are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note 4: VDROP is measured as the voltage from the driver output to GND (VDRIVER - VGND) when measuring thelow-side driver
         current limit and as (V24 - VDRIVER) when measuring the high-side driver current limit.
