Application Information (Continued)
Typical Application – 16:1 Bridge Sensor Interface
The XR10910 was designed to interface multiple bridge sensors with a microcontroller or FPGA as illustrated in Figure 25.
The bridge output signal is differential (Vo+ and Vo-). Ideally, the unloaded bridge output is zero (Vo+ and Vo- are identical).
However, in-exact resistive values result in a difference between Vo+ and Vo-. This bridge offset voltage can be substantial
and vary between sensors. The XR10910 provides the ability to calibrate the bridge offset on each of the 16 bridge sensors
using the on-board DAC.

Layout Considerations
General layout and supply bypassing play major roles in high frequency performance. Follow the steps below as a basis for
high frequency layout:
  ■■ Include 6.8µF and 0.1µF ceramic capacitors for power supply decoupling
  ■■ Place the 6.8µF capacitor within 0.75 inches of the power pin
  ■■ Place the 0.1µF capacitor within 0.1 inches of the power pin
  ■■ Connection to the exposed pad is not required. Exposed pad can be connected to ground (GND).
  ■■ Minimize all trace lengths to reduce series inductances
                                                                         REV 1D                                           19/22
