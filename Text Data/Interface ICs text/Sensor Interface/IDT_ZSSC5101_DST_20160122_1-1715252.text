2       Circuit Description
2.1.     Overview
The ZSSC5101 is a sensor signal conditioner and encoder for magnetoresistive sensor bridges. In a typical set-
up for rotational or linear motion, the sensor bridges provide two sinusoidal signals, which are phase-shifted by
90° (Vsin and Vcos). The ZSSC5101 converts these two signals into a linear voltage ramp, proportional to the
rotation angle or linear distance by means of a CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm.
The output voltage VOUT (see specification 1.3.4.1) is ratiometric to VDDE; the typical supply voltage is 5V ±10%.
Using the ZSSC5101’s one-wire interface (OWI), a sensor assembly containing an xMR sensor bridge and the
ZSSC5101 can be connected to a host controller by means of just three wires:
     •  VDDE (4.5 to 5.5V)
     •  VOUT (sensor output and programming input)
     •  VSSE (ground)
The VOUT pin is used for sensor output, programming, and diagnostics for the ZSSC5101 through the OWI (see
section 2.3). All parameters are stored in a nonvolatile memory (EEPROM) and can be read and re-programmed
by the user.
By using the output pin for programming, no additional wires are required to calibrate the sensor. This facilitates
in-line programming and re-programming of fully assembled sensor modules.
The ZSSC5101 also provides failure mode detection, such as broken supply or broken ground detection. In
Normal Operating Mode, the output voltage ranges from ≥5% VDDE to ≤95% VDDE. Both clamping levels are
programmable (see specifications 1.3.3.12 and 1.3.3.13).
In the case of failure detection, the output voltage will be outside the normal operating range (<4%VDDE and
>96%VDDE).

                                                                                                   ZSSC5101 Datasheet
The ZSSC5101 is supplied by a single supply voltage VDDE of 5V ±10%. Internal low-dropout linear voltage
regulators (LDOs) generate the required analog and digital supply voltages as well as the supply voltage for the
sensor bridge, VDDS.
The ZSSC5101 accepts fully differential signals from both sine and cosine sensor bridges. These signals are
connected to the VSINP, VSINN pins and the VCOSP, VCOSN pins, respectively.
Both sine and cosine signals are then multiplexed, sequentially pre-amplified, and sampled by a 12-bit ADC. The
xMR COS/SIN-bridge circuitry is alternately sampled at a frequency of ~200kHz to ensure an identical signal
conversion in both sine and cosine paths.
Following data conversion, the digital sine and cosine values representing X and Y rectangular coordinates are
converted into their respective polar coordinates, phase, and magnitude by means of coordinate transformation
using a CORDIC algorithm.
Phase information ranges from 0 to 2π, which is equivalent to one full wave of the input signal. This information
is further used to calculate the analog output voltage, depending on the user-programmable settings, such as
zero position or angle range. See section 4.3 for further details.
The magnitude information is equivalent to the strength of the input signal (Vpeak). This information is further
used to determine a “magnet loss” error state. See section 2.6 for further details.
Based on the calculated phase information and the user-programmed zero, slope, and clamping parameters, the
corresponding output values are calculated and routed to the DAC input. The DAC output is driven by a buffer
amplifier and routed to the output pin VOUT.
2.3.      One-Wire Interface and Command Mode (CM)
In Normal Operating Mode (NOM), the VOUT pin is a buffered, analog output, providing an output voltage
equivalent to the sensor input signals.
Because the same pin is used for programming via the OWI, a specific sequence is required to put the ZSSC5101
into command / programming mode (CM):
    •   After power-on, the circuit starts in NOM and provides a valid output signal after t_on.
    •   In parallel, the ZSSC5101 monitors the VOUT pin for a valid signature command from the programming
        system to enable the Command Mode (authorization). Therefore, the programming system must be able to
        overdrive the output buffer with a driver strength greater than IOUT-LIMIT (see 1.3.4.7).
    •   The ZSSC5101 can only be unlocked by receiving a predefined user-programmable signature. This
        signature is stored in the EEPROM in a write-only register.
    •   If CM is active, the output buffer is switched to high impedance and communication over the one-wire
        interface is enabled.
    •   The time frame to enter CM with a valid signature command is limited to tCODE, but it is always open in
        Diagnostics Mode (see section 2.6).
    •   Digital data transmission over the one-wire-interface bus is accomplished using PWM-coded signals. For
        further information on the OWI protocol, please contact IDT technical support (see contact information on
        page 28).

a defined state, which is a substantial feature for safety-critical applications.

2.5.      Power Loss / GND Loss
2.5.1.      Purpose
In NOM, the output voltage of the ZSSC5101 is within the range of 5%VDDE ≤ VOUT ≤ 95% VDDE.
In the event of a loss of VDDE or VSSE, for example due to a broken supply wire, the output voltage VOUT will
be driven into the diagnostics range, which is a voltage level outside of the normal operating range. This makes a
power loss easily identifiable by the host controller.
The diagnostic levels are defined as
    •   Diagnostics LOW level:       VOUT <= 4% VDDE; see specification 1.3.7.6
    •   Diagnostics HIGH level:      VOUT >= 96% VDDE; see specification 1.3.7.7
2.5.2.      Power Loss Behavior
In order to ensure that the output can be safely driven to the Diagnostics Mode levels, a pull-up or pull-down
resistor ≥ 5kΩ must be connected at the receiving side of the VOUT signal.

3      EEPROM
The ZSSC5101 contains a non-volatile EEPROM memory for storing manufacturer codes and calibration values
as well as user-programmable data. Access to the EEPROM is available over the output pin VOUT by using IDT’s
one-wire interface (see section 2.3).

3.2.     CRC Algorithm
EEPROM data is verified by implementing an 8-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC).
3.3.     EDC Algorithm
The EEPROM is protected against bit errors through an error detection and correction (EDC) algorithm. The
protection logic corrects any single-bit error in a data word and can detect all double-bit errors. A single-bit error is
corrected, and the ZSSC5101 continues in Normal Operating Mode. On detection of a double-bit error, the
ZSSC5101 enters the Diagnostics Mode.

The circuit diagram in Figure 4.1 shows a typical application for the ZSSC5101 with an AMR double Wheatstone
sensor bridge. Due to the nature of AMR sensors, the periodicity of these sensor signals is 180 mechanical
degrees.
The sensor bridges are mechanically rotated by 45° from each other, providing differential output signals that are
90 electrical degrees apart. The ZSSC5101 converts these sine and cosine signals into a linear output voltage
with a programmable full-scale angle range from 0° to 5° up to 0° to 180° with a resolution of 0.022° to 0.04° per
step (see specification 1.3.3.10). The ZSSC5101 accepts sensor signals with a sensitivity up to ±23mV/V (see
specification 1.2.1.14), which is sufficient for a typical AMR sensor bridge. No external components are required
at the sensor inputs.

The circuit diagram in Figure 4.2 shows a typical application for the ZSSC5101 with two TMR sensor bridges.
TMR and GMR sensors have a periodicity of 360 mechanical degrees; therefore this configuration can be used to
measure the absolute angle of a full mechanical turn.
The sensor bridges are mechanically rotated by 90° from each other, providing differential output signals that are
90 electrical degrees apart. The ZSSC5101 converts these sine and cosine signals into a linear output voltage
with a programmable full-scale angle range from 0° to 10° up to 0° to 360° with a resolution of 0.044° to 0.08° per
step (see specification 1.3.3.10). As a TMR sensor bridge has a much higher sensitivity than an AMR Sensor (up
to 2 orders of magnitude), a resistive divider consisting of 2x Rs and Rp is added to each sensor input channel
(sin, cos) of the ZSSC5101 to match the sensor bridge with the ZSSC5101 inputs.
For best temperature compensation, Rs and Rp should have the same temperature coefficient TC and routed
close together on the same printed circuit board (PCB).
4.3.   Mechanical Set-up for Absolute Angle Measurements
Figure 4.3 shows a typical set-up for an absolute rotation angle measurement. A diametrically magnetized magnet
is mounted at the end of a rotating shaft with a specific gap. The rotation axis of the magnet is centered over the
xMR sensor (see sensor manufacturer’s data sheet for exact location). Depending on the maximum angle to be
measured, the sensor can be either an AMR sensor with a maximum absolute angle of 180° or a TMR/GMR
sensor with a maximum absolute angle of 360° (see 4.1 and 4.2 for further details).
The ZSSC5101 converts the sine and cosine signals generated by the xMR sensor bridge into a linear ramp that
is proportional to the rotation angle.
The gap between magnet and sensor is determined by the strength of the magnet and the type of sensor.
Stronger magnets allow larger air gaps, and due to their higher sensitivity, TMR sensors allow larger air gaps than
AMR sensors. The air gap should be chosen such that the sensor output signal remains undistorted and
sinusoidal.

In order to adjust the linear ramp to the mechanical angle range, the ZSSC5101 provides several programmable
parameters. These parameters are stored in an on-chip EEPROM and can be re-programmed by the user (see
Figure 4.3):
    •  Zero angle position: aligns the mechanical zero position to the electrical zero position
    •  Maximum angle position: matches the full stroke of the ramp to the mechanical angular range
    •  Clamp switch angle: defines the angle position where the output voltage returns from Vout,max to Vout,min
    •  Maximum output voltage, upper clamping level Vout,max
    •  Minimum output voltage, lower clamping level Vout,min
    •  Ramp direction: rising or falling ramp

4.4.    Mechanical Set-up for Linear Distance Measurements
Figure 4.4 shows a typical set-up for a linear distance measurement. The xMR sensor provides a sinusoidal
signal that is proportional to the length of a magnetic pole (AMR) or to the length of a magnetic pole pair (TMR).
The graph shown below shows a setup for an AMR sensor (e.g., Sensitec AA700 family; www.sensitec.com,
Measurement Specialties KMT series, www.meas-spec.com).
As the magnet is moving on a linear path, one output ramp is generated with each pole; hence an absolute linear
distance measurement is possible within the length of one pole:
                                                                     Vout − Vout ,min

                                                                    Vout ,max − Vout ,min
where: LP =          pole length of the sensor magnet
         VOUT =      output voltage of the ZSSC5101
         VOUT,max = maximum output clamping voltage of ZSSC5101 ( programmable; e.g. 95% VDD)
         VOUT,min = minimum output clamping voltage of ZSSC5101 ( programmable; e.g. 5% VDD)
Longer linear distances can be measured by using multi-pole magnetic strips and by counting the number of
ramps from a defined home position. Each full ramp (VOUT,min to VOUT,max) corresponds to the length of one
magnetic pole.

4.5.       Input-to-Output Characteristics Calculation Examples
Figure 4.5 shows a detailed view of the possible settings for clamping levels, zero position, ramp slope, and
clamp switch angle.
The total output range VOUT from 0 to 100% VDDE is 5120 DAC steps.
In the normal operating range (5 to 95% VDDE), the DAC output can range from 256 to 4864, allowing 4608 steps
(12.17bit) for the analog output voltage.
The full-scale angular range is 180° for AMR sensors and 360° for GMR and TMR sensors. Consequently, the
full-scale angular step resolution is
                                   180°/4608 = 0.039 mechanical degrees for AMR sensors and
                                   360°/4608 = 0.078 mechanical degrees for GMR and TMR sensors
Smaller angular ranges result in a finer angular step resolution. The smallest angle step is 0.022° (= 180°/8192).
For example, a total stroke of 30° (e.g., in a pedal application) will yield the following results:
                                   30°/0.022° = 1365 steps (using an AMR sensor)

6.2.      Die Dimensions and Pad Coordinates
Die dimensions and pad coordinates are available on request in a separate document. See section 10.
7       Layout Requirements
Recommendation: Keep the traces between the xMR sensor and the ZSSC5101 (VDDS, VSSS, VSINP, VSINN,
VCOSP, and VCOSN pins) as short as possible. Additional resistors for using TMR sensors (see Figure 4.2)
should have the same temperature coefficient TC and be routed close together on the same PCB.
8       Reliability and RoHS Conformity
The ZSSC5101 is qualified according to the AEC-Q100 standard, operating temperature grade 0.
The ZSSC5101 complies with the RoHS directive and does not contain hazardous substances.
The complete RoHS declaration update can be downloaded at www.IDT.com.
