The DS1876 controls and monitors all functions for        S Meets All SFF-8472 Transmitter Control and
dual transmitter modules. The memory map is based           Monitoring Requirements
on SFF-8472. The DS1876 supports APC and modula-          S Six Analog Monitor Channels: Temperature, VCC,
tion control and eye safety functionality for two laser     PMON1, BMON1, PMON2, BMON2
drivers. It continually monitors for high output current,      PMON_ and BMON_ Support Internal and
high bias current, and low and high transmit power to            External Calibration
ensure that laser shutdown for eye safety requirements         Scalable Dynamic Range
are met without adding external components. Six ADC            Internal Direct-to-Digital Temperature Sensor
channels monitor VCC, temperature, and four external           Alarm and Warning Flags for All Monitored
monitor inputs that can be used to meet all monitoring           Channels
requirements.

*Subject to not exceeding +6V.
Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute
maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: All voltages are referenced to ground. Current into the IC is positive, and current out of the IC is negative.
Note 2: Inputs are at supply rail. Outputs are not loaded.
Note 3: This parameter is guaranteed by design.
Note 4: Full scale is user programmable.
Note 5: A temperature conversion is completed and MOD1 DAC, MOD2 DAC, APC1 DAC, and APC2 DAC values are recalled
        from the LUT and VCC has been measured to be above VCC LO alarm, if the VCC LO alarm is enabled.
Note 6: I2C interface timing shown is for fast-mode (400kHz) operation. This device is also backward compatible with I2C stan-
        dard mode.
Note 7: CB—Total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
Note 8: EEPROM write begins after a STOP condition occurs.

              There are two passwords for the DS1876. Each password is 4 bytes long. The lower level password (PW1) has
              all the access of a normal user plus those made available with PW1. The higher level password (PW2) has all the
              access of PW1 plus those made available with PW2. The values of the passwords reside in EEPROM inside PW2
              memory. At power-up, all PWE bits are set to 1. All reads at this location are 0.

           Holds the calculated index based on the temperature measurement. This index is used for the address during lookup
           of Tables 04h and 06h. Temperature measurements below -40NC or above +102NC are clamped to 80h and C7h,
           respectively. The calculation of TINDEX is as follows:
                                                                   Temp_Value + 40°C

           For the temperature-indexed LUTs (2NC), the index used during the lookup function for each table is as follows:
           Table 04h (MOD)          1    TINDEX6         TINDEX5      TINDEX4       TINDEX3       TINDEX2       TINDEX1       TINDEX0

           For the 8-position LUT tables, the following table shows the lookup function:
           TINDEX         1000_0xxx     1001_0xxx       1001_1xxx    1010_0xxx     1010_1xxx     1011_0xxx     1011_1xxx     11xx_xxxx

                This value becomes the I2C slave address for the main memory when the ASEL bit (Table 02h, Register 88h)
                is set. If A0h is programmed to this register, the auxiliary memory is disabled. For example, writing xxxx_010x
                makes the main device addresses A4h and B4h.

                         setting of 3FFh results in a pulsed-density output of 1023/1024 held mostly at VREFIN.
                         1 = Inverted polarity. A setting of 000h results in a pulse-density output of zero held at VREFIN, and
                         a setting of 3FFh results in a pulsed-density output of 1023/1024 held mostly at GND.
                         MOD1P: MOD1 DAC polarity. The MOD1 DAC (Table 02h, Registers CCh–CDh) range is
                         000h–3FFh. A setting of 000h creates a pulse-density of zero and 3FFh creates a pulse-density of
                         1023/1024. This polarity bit allows the user to use GND or VREFIN as the reference. The power-on
                         of MOD1 DAC is 000h; thus an application that needs VREFIN to be the off state should use the
               BIT 1     inverted polarity.
                         0 = Normal polarity. A setting of 000h results in a pulse-density output of zero held at GND, and a
                         setting of 3FFh results in a pulsed-density output of 1023/1024 held mostly at VREFIN.
                         1 = Inverted polarity. A setting of 000h results in a pulse-density output of zero held at VREFIN, and
                         a setting of 3FFh results in a pulsed-density output of 1023/1024 held mostly at GND.
                         APC1P: APC1 DAC polarity. The APC1 DAC (Table 02h, Registers CEh–CFh) range is 000h–3FFh.
                         A setting of 000h creates a pulse-density of zero, and 3FFh creates a pulse-density of 1023/1024.
                         This polarity bit allows the user to use GND or VREFIN as the reference. The power-on of APC1
                         DAC is 000h; thus an application that needs VREFIN to be the off state should use the inverted
               BIT 0     polarity.
                         0 = Normal polarity. A setting of 000h results in a pulse-density output of zero held at GND, and a
                         setting of 3FFh results in a pulsed-density output of 1023/1024 held mostly at VREFIN.

              Digital value for the MOD1 DAC (A2h address) and MOD2 DAC (B2h address) outputs. The MODULATION LUT
              is a set of registers assigned to hold the temperature profile for the MOD1 and MOD2 DACs. The temperature
              measurement is used to index the LUT (TINDEX, Table 02h, Register 81h) in 2NC increments from -40NC to
              +102NC, starting at 80h in Table 04h. Register 80h defines the -40NC to -38NC MOD output, Register 81h defines
              -38NC to -36NC MOD output, and so on. Values recalled from this EEPROM memory table are written into the
              MOD1 and MOD2 DACs (Table 02h, Registers C8h–C9h, CCh–CDh) locations that hold the values until the next
              temperature conversion. The part can be placed into a manual mode (MOD1EN and MOD2EN bits, Table 02h,
              Register 80h), where MOD1 and MOD2 DACs are directly controlled for calibration. If the temperature compen-
              sation functionality is not required, program the entire Table 04h to the desired modulation setting.

                 The digital value for the APC1 DAC (A2h address) and APC2 DAC (B2h address) outputs. The APC LUT is a
                 set of registers assigned to hold the temperature profile for the APC1 and APC2 DACs. The temperature mea-
                 surement is used to index the LUT (TINDEX, Table 02h, Register 81h) in 2NC increments from -40NC to +102NC,
                 starting at 80h. Register 80h defines the -40NC to -38NC APC output, Register 81h defines -38NC to -36NC APC
                 output, and so on. Values recalled from this EEPROM memory table are written into the APC1 and APC2 DACs
                 (Table 02h, Registers CAh–CBh, CEh–CFh) locations that hold the values until the next temperature conver-
                 sion. The part can be placed into a manual mode (APC1EN and APC2EN bits, Table 02h, Register 80h), where
                 APC1 and APC2 DACs are directly controlled for calibration. If the temperature compensation functionality is not
                 required, program the entire Table 06h to the desired APC setting.

                         SDA and SCL Pullup Resistors
 SDA is an open-collector output on the DS1876 that
 requires a pullup resistor to realize high logic levels. A
 master using either an open-collector output with a pul-
 lup resistor or a push-pull output driver can be used for
 SCL. Pullup resistor values should be chosen to ensure
 that the rise and fall times listed in the I2C AC Electrical
 Characteristics table are within specification.
