LX3301A Inductive Sensor Interface IC with Embedded MCU
Description
The LX3301A is a member of Microsemi’s new family of smart sensor interface products. Designed to process inductive
sensors, which are based upon linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) principles, this new device integrates two complete
analog channels, oscillator/exciter, 32-bit RISC processor, non-volatile configuration memory, and analog or PWM outputs.

In typical operation, inputs from the inductive sensor are conditioned, demodulated, and converted into 13-bit values. The
MCU processes these values to produce a linearized measurement value with either 12-bit accuracy (analog output) or 13-bit
accuracy (PWM output.) Internal non-volatile memory allows the user to configure various parameters within the IC, including
five (5) calibration points, origin/end points, and low and high plateau levels. The internal non-volatile memory is configured
via the VIN power pin, which allows a sensor assembly to be configured without the need for additional programming pins.
