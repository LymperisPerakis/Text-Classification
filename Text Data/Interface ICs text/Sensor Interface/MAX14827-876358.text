                                                          Regulators are automatically switched on when the
                     P33 = 1.7V × ILOAD33
                                                          internal die temperature falls below the thermal shutdown
Calculate the quiescent power dissipation in the device   threshold plus hysteresis. If the internal V5 regulator is
using the following equation:                             used, the internal registers return to their default state
                  P24 = I24(max) × V24(max)               when the V5 regulator is switched back on.
If the weak current sinks/sources are enabled, calculate
their associated power dissipation as:
                PPD = IPD(max) × VC/Q (max)
            PPU = IPU(max) × [V24 - VC/Q](max)

 The INTERRUPT register reflects current state of various fault conditions. The IRQ/OC output asserts when any of the
 bits in the INTERRUPT register is set. INTERRUPT register bits are latched and are not cleared when the initiating
 condition is removed. Reading the INTERRUPT register clears all the bits and deasserts IRQ/OC. IRQ/OC reasserts
 only when another fault condition occurs.

SPI Burst Access
Burst access allows writing or reading in one block,
by only defining the initial register address in the SPI
command byte. Once the initial SPI address is received,                            V24
the MAX14827 automatically increments the register after
each SPI data byte. Efficient programming of multiple
consecutive registers is thus possible. Chip select, CS/
PP, must be kept low during the whole write/read cycle.
The SPI clock continues clocking throughout the burst
access cycle. The burst cycle ends when the SPI master
                                                                        MAX14827    DO

defined by VL. Apply a voltage from 2.5V to 5.5V to VL for
normal operation. Logic outputs are supplied by VL.                               GND
The device can be configured for simultaneous or
multiplexed UART communication. When configured for a
multipexed UART interface, the SPI interface and UART
interface pins are shared. See the Mode Selection Table
