 1      Electrical Characteristics
 1.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings
The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The ZSSC3154 might not function or be operable above
the recommended operating conditions. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also damage
the device. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions might affect
device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute Maximum Ratings.”
Parameters apply in operating temperature range and without time limitations.

 2     Circuit Description
 2.1 Signal Flow
The ZSSC3154 signal path consists of the analog front-end (AFE), the digital signal processing unit, two analog
output stages, the one-wire interface (OWI) and an overvoltage protection circuitry. Based on a differential
structure, the bridge inputs VBP and VBN are handled by two signal lines, each with a dynamic range sym-
metrical to the common mode potential (analog ground equal to VDDA/2). Therefore, it is possible to amplify
positive and negative input signals within the common mode range of the signal input. The input signals are
selected by the input multiplexer.

                                                                                                 ZSSC3154 Datasheet
The multiplexer (MUX) transmits the signals from either the bridge sensor or from the selected temperature
sensor to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in a defined sequence. The temperature sensors can either be
external diodes, external thermistors (RTD), or an internal diode selected by EEPROM configuration. The
differential signal from the bridge sensors is pre-amplified by the programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The ADC
converts these signals into digital values.
The digital signal correction is processed in the calibration microcontroller (CMC) using a ROM-resident correction
formula and sensor-specific coefficients stored in the EEPROM during calibration. The configuration data and the
correction parameters can be programmed into the EEPROM by digital one-wire communication at the main
                                                  2
output pin or by digital communication via the I C™ interface. During the calibration procedure the digital interface
can provide measurement values as well.
The conditioned bridge sensor signal is always output as a continuous analog signal at the main output pin.
Depending on the programmed configuration, there are several output modes for the second analog output pin;
e.g., output the inverse bridge sensor signal, output the conditioned temperature signal, or output the half-bridge
sensor signal.
2.2 Application Modes
For each application, a configuration set must be established by programming the on-chip EEPROM for the
following modes:
    • Sensor channel
        Input range: Select the gain adjustment of the analog front-end (AFE) with respect to the maximum
           sensor signal span and the zero point of the A/D conversion.
        Analog sensor offset compensation (XZC): If required, this compensates large sensor offsets; e.g., if the
           sensor offset voltage is near to or larger than the sensor span.
        Resolution/response time: Configure the A/D converter resolution. These settings influence the sampling
           rate and the signal integration time, and therefore the noise immunity.
    • Temperature
        Temperature measurement for the calibration: Select the internal or external temperature sensor for the
           compensation of temperature-related bridge sensor signal deviations.
        Temperature measurement for the temperature output: Select the internal or external temperature
           sensor for the temperature measurement.
    • Output
        Output signals: Assign the measured and conditioned signals to the second analog output;
           e.g., inverse bridge sensor signal, temperature signal, or half-bridge sensor signal.
        Output mode: Select the output mode for the second analog output; e.g., continuous signal or sequential
           analog output.

                                                                                                  ZSSC3154 Datasheet
2.3 System Control
 2.3.1       Main System Tasks
The calibration microcontroller (CMC) is the central system control unit and supports the following tasks and
features:
    • Manage the startup sequence
    • Control the measurement cycle regarding to the EEPROM-stored configuration data
    • Process the signal conditioning calculation (16-bit calculation for the measured signals using the
       ROM-resident signal conditioning formulas and the EEPROM-stored conditioning coefficients)
    • Assign the conditioned output values to the analog outputs and control the output behavior
    • Process the communication requests received via the digital interfaces
    • Perform failsafe tasks and indicate detected errors by setting analog outputs to the diagnostic fault band
 2.3.2       General Working Modes
The ZSSC3154 supports three different working modes:
    • Normal Operation Mode (NOM) – for continuous processing of the signal conditioning
    • Command Mode (CM) – for configuration and calibration and for access to all internal registers
    • Diagnostic Mode (DM) – for failure messages
 2.4 Normal Operation Mode
A configured and calibrated ZSSC3154 starts the Normal Operation Mode (NOM) immediately after power-on if
there is no communication request within a startup window (refer to the ZSSC3154 Functional Description for
details). It consists of a startup phase, the measurement cycle, the conditioning calculation, and the analog output
for the sensor signals.
 2.4.1       Startup Phase
After power-on, the startup phase is processed, which includes
    •  Settling of the internal supply voltages including the reset of the circuitry
    •  System start and configuration, EEPROM readout, and signature check
    •  ROM check, if enabled
    •  Processing the measurement cycle start routine including all measurements to provide the configured
       output signals
    • One-wire communication window
If an error is detected during the startup phase, the Diagnostic Mode (DM) is activated and the analog output at
the AOUT1 and AOUT2 pins remains in the diagnostic fault band range.
After the startup phase, the continuously running measurement and sensor signal conditioning cycle is started,
and the analog or digital output of the conditioned sensor signals is activated.

                                                                                                                                                  ZSSC3154 Datasheet
 2.4.2           Measurement Cycle
The measurement cycle is controlled by the CMC. Depending on EEPROM settings, the multiplexer (MUX)
selects the following input signals in a defined sequence:
    •    Differential bridge sensor signal
    •    Conditioning temperature for bridge sensor signal conditioning calculation
    •    Temperature sensor signal
    •    Single-ended half-bridge sensor signal measured against an internal reference voltage
    •    Internal offset of the analog front end (auto-zero compensation)
    •    Diagnostic signals
The cycle diagram in Figure 2.2 shows the basic structure of the measurement cycle. After power-on, the startup
routine is processed, which performs all required measurements to expedite acquiring an initial valid conditioned
sensor output. After the startup routine, the normal measurement cycle runs.

nonlinearity. The result is a non-negative 15-bit value in the range [0; 1).

2.5 Bridge Sensor Measurement
The ZSSC3154's main task is measuring a differential bridge sensor signal. The signal path is ratiometric and fully
differential. The ratiometric reference voltage VREF is equal (VBR_T – VBR_B). The internal offset of the analog front-
end is eliminated by an auto-zero compensation.
The bridge sensor signal value is processed by a conditioning calculation to correct the temperature-dependent
gain and to compensate the temperature-dependent offset and the nonlinearity up to 3rd order. The conditioning
coefficients are stored in the EEPROM. For a detailed description of the bridge signal conditioning formula refer to
the ZSSC3154 Functional Description.
2.6 Temperature Measurement
The ZSSC3154 supports different methods for acquiring temperature data needed for the conditioning of the
sensor signal as well as for a separate temperature measurement:
    • an internal pn-junction temperature sensor,
    • an external pn-junction temperature sensor connected to the sensor top potential (pin VBR_T), or
    • an external resistive half-bridge temperature sensor connected at the top with 1:10 resistance ratio.
Recommend resistive sensors are Pt1000, Pt10000, and Cu or Ni based positive-temperature-coefficient resistive
temperature devices (PTC RTDs); e.g., KTY series.
The internal offset of the analog-front end is eliminated by an auto-zero compensation.
The temperature value is processed by a conditioning calculation to correct the gain and to compensate the offset
and the 2nd order nonlinearity. The conditioning coefficients are stored in the EEPROM. For a detailed description
of the temperature conditioning formula, refer to the ZSSC3154 Functional Description.
2.7 Half-Bridge Sensor Measurement
The ZSSC3154 supports measuring a half-bridge sensor signal referenced to an internal reference potential. The
signal path is ratiometric and fully differential. The ratiometric reference voltage VREF is equal (VVBR_T - VVBR_B).
The half-bridge sensor signal value is processed by a conditioning calculation to correct the temperature-
dependent gain and to compensate the temperature-dependent offset and the 2nd order nonlinearity. The
conditioning coefficients are stored in the EEPROM. For a detailed description of the half-bridge signal
conditioning formula, refer to the ZSSC3154 Functional Description.

  1)   Recommended maximum internal signal range is 80% of supply voltage.
       Span is calculated by the following formula: VIN_SPAN = 0.8 (VVBR_T – VVBR_B) / aIN.
  2)   Refer to section 2.8.2 for an explanation of the analog offset compensation.
Recommendation: To achieve the best stability and linearity performance of the AFE, operate the PGA in a
voltage range within 10% to 90% of the ratiometric reference voltage VREF = (VVBR_T – VVBR_B). The gain must be
selected to guarantee this constraint for the entire operating temperature range of the application and for the
specified sensor bridge tolerances.

2.8.2      Offset Compensation
The ZSSC3154 supports two methods for sensor offset compensation:
   • Digital offset correction is processed during the signal conditioning calculation by the calibration micro-
      controller (CMC).
   • Extended analog offset compensation (XZC) is achieved by adding a compensation voltage into the analog
      signal path. This removes large offsets up to 300% of signal span and prevents overdriving the analog
      signal path.

 2.8.3      Analog-to-Digital Converter
The analog-to-digital converter is implemented using the full differential switched-capacitor technique. The A/D
resolution is 14-bit. The ADC operates in the second order configuration. The conversion is largely insensitive to
short-term and long-term instabilities of the clock frequency. The ADC must be configured for the following
features:
    • Adjustable A/D conversion time and integration phase length
    • Adjustable A/D conversion input voltage range

2.9 Signal Outputs
 2.9.1      Analog Output
ZSSC3154 provides two analog outputs at the AOUT1 and AOUT2 pins. The analog output behavior and the
assignment of the several conditioned sensor signals to the analog outputs are configurable:
    •  Conditioned bridge sensor signal is always assigned to and continuously output at the AOUT1 pin.
    •  Conditioned temperature signal can be assigned to the analog output at the AOUT2 pin.
    •  Conditioned half-bridge signal can be assigned to the analog output at the AOUT2 pin.
    •  A function of the conditioned bridge sensor signal can be assigned to the analog output at the AOUT2 pin.
    •  A sequential analog output mode can be assigned to the analog output at the AOUT2 pin. The sequence of
       output signals includes the diagnostic fault band HIGH and LOW level, the conditioned temperature or the
       half-bridge signal, and a function of the conditioned bridge sensor signal (refer to section 2.9.2).
    • Both analog outputs support low-pass filtering of the assigned conditioned sensor signals.
    • Both analog outputs can support diagnostic procedures of the application by providing a power-on
       diagnostic output waveform.
For a detailed description of analog output modes and their configuration, refer to the ZSSC3154 Functional
Description.

2.9.2                         Sequential Analog Output
The sequential analog output mode allows the analog output of two conditioned sensor signals at the AOUT2 pin.
The sequence of output signals includes both the low and high diagnostic fault band levels (DFB Low and DFB
High, respectively) for synchronization and for a repeated verification of diagnostic levels. This is followed by
output of the conditioned temperature or half-bridge signal to provide the second signal. The last transmission in
the sequence is a function of the conditioned bridge sensor signal for verification of the analog output at the
AOUT1 pin.

The ZSSC3154 contains a serial digital I C interface that supports digital readout of the conditioned sensor
signals with a resolution of 13 bits as described in section 2.10.
2.10 Serial Digital Interfaces
                                                                                                                        2       TM                                                         TM
The ZSSC3154 contains both a serial digital I C          interface and a ZACwire          interface for one-wire
communication (OWI). The digital interfaces allow configuration and calibration of the sensor module. OWI
communication can be used to perform an end-of-line calibration via the analog output pin AOUT1 of a completely
                               2 TM
assembled sensor module. The I C interface provides the readout of the conditioned sensor signal data during
normal operation mode.
For a detailed description of the digital serial interfaces and the communication protocols, refer to the ZSSC3154
Functional Description.

2.11 Failsafe Features
ZSSC3154 provides various failsafe tasks to control the proper function of the device and the connected sensors:
    •  Observation of sensors: bridge sensor aging, connection, and short check; temperature sensor check
    •  Observation of analog front-end (AFE): AFE built-in self-test; AFE overdrive control
    •  Observation of digital control unit: oscillator-fail detection; watchdog; arithmetic check
    •  Observation of memory content: EEPROM and ROM signatures, RAM and registers parity checks
    •  Observation of chip: supply power and ground loss, broken-chip check
For a detailed description of failsafe tasks and their configuration, refer to ZSSC3154 Functional Description.
When a failure is detected, the Diagnostic Mode (DM) is activated. The AOUT1 and AOUT2 analog outputs are
set to the diagnostic fault band (DFB). The DFB output level must be selected by the wiring of the DFBH pin. If the
DFBH pin is open, the outputs are switched to the diagnostic fault band level LOW. If the DFBH pin is connected
to VSSA, the outputs are switched to the diagnostic fault band level HIGH. The selected DFB mode should match
the connected load resistances at the analog outputs to reduce power loss if the diagnostic mode is activated.
2.12 Overvoltage and Short Circuit Protection
The ZSSC3154 is designed for a 5V (±10%) supply provided by an electronic control unit (ECU). Internal sub-
assemblies are supplied and protected by integrated voltage regulators and limiters up to a supply voltage of
7.7V. The two analog output stages are protected by current limiters against short circuits to an external supply or
ground. These functions are described in detail in ZSSC3154 Application Note – Power Management.
ZSSC3154 protection features are guaranteed without time limit when the device is operated in the application
circuits shown in section 3.
