1.1.      Absolute Maximum Ratings
Note: The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The ZSSC3026 might not function or be operable
above the recommended operating conditions. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also
damage the device. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions
might affect device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute Maximum Ratings.”

In order to achieve minimum current consumption in idle mode, a dynamic power-on-reset circuit is implemented.
The VDD low level and the subsequent rise time and VDD rising slope must fulfill specific constraints to guarantee
an overall ZSSC3026 reset. In general, lower VDD low levels allow slower rising of the subsequent on-ramp of VDD.
The following table shows the relevant reset parameters and conditions. Other combinations might also be
possible. For example, the reset trigger can be influenced by increasing the power-down time and relaxing the
VDD rising slope requirement.

2 Circuit Description
2.1.   Brief Description
The ZSSC3026 provides a highly accurate amplification of bridge sensor signals. The compensation of sensor
offset, sensitivity, temperature drift, and non-linearity is accomplished via an 18-bit DSP core running a correction
algorithm with calibration coefficients stored in an MTP memory. The ZSSC3026 can be configured for a wide
                                                                       2
range of resistive bridge sensor types. A digital interface (SPI or I C™) enables communication. The ZSSC3026
supports two operational modes: Normal Mode and Command Mode. Normal Mode is the standard operating
mode. Typically in Normal Mode, the ZSSC3026 wakes up from a Sleep State (low power), runs a measurement
in Active State, and automatically returns to the Sleep State. (See section 3.3 for details on operational modes.)
2.2.   Signal Flow and Block Diagram
See Figure 2.1 for the ZSSC3026 block diagram. The sensor bridge supply VDDB and the power supply for analog
circuitry are provided by a voltage regulator, which is optimized for power supply disturbance rejection (PSRR).
See section 1.4 for a graph of PSRR versus frequency. To improve noise suppression, the digital blocks are
powered by a separate voltage regulator. A power supervision circuit monitors all supply voltages and generates
appropriate reset signals for initializing the digital blocks.
The state machine controls the analog circuitry to perform the three measurement types: bridge, temperature, and
offset measurement. The multiplexer selects the signal input to the amplifier, which can be the external signals
from the input pins INP and INN, the internal temperature reference sensor signals, or an input short for
measuring offset. A full measurement request will trigger an automatic sequence of all measurement types and all
input signals, respectively. The Temperature Reference Sensor block is based on a resistive sensing element.

The amplifier consists of two stages with programmable gain values. The 1/f noise and inherent offset are
suppressed by auto-zero and chopper-stabilizer techniques. This auto-zero sequence is performed before each
bridge sensor and temperature measurement to compensate for the inherent offset of the amplifier.
The ZSSC3026 employs a charge-balancing analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on switched-capacitor
technique with inherit low-pass behavior and noise suppression. The programmable resolution from 10 to 16 bit
provides flexibility for adapting the conversion characteristics. To improve power supply noise suppression, the
ADC uses the bridge supply VDDB as its reference voltage.
The remaining IC-internal offset and the sensor element offset; i.e., the overall system offset for the amplifier and
ADC can be canceled by an offset and auto-zero measurement, respectively.

The DSP accomplishes the auto-zero, span, and 1 and 2 order temperature compensation of the measured
bridge signal. The correction coefficients are stored in the MTP memory.

The ZSSC3026 supports SPI and I C™ interface communication for controlling the ZSSC3026, configuration, and
measurement result output.

2.3.1. Amplifier
The amplifier has a differential architecture, and it consists of two stages. The amplification of each stage and
the sensor bridge gain polarity are programmable via settings in the Measurement Configuration Register
(BM_config; see section 3.6.3) in the MTP memory (see section 2.4.2).
The first five bits of BM_config are the programmable gain settings Gain_stage1 and Gain_stage2. The options
for the programmable gain settings are listed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2.

If needed, the polarity of the sensor bridge gain can be reversed by setting the Gain_Polarity bit, which is bit 5 in
the BM_config register (see section 3.6.3). Changing the gain polarity is achieved by inverting the chopper clock.
Table 2.3 gives the settings for the Gain_Polarity bit. This feature enables connecting a sensor to the ZSSC3026
with swapped input signals at INN and INP; e.g., to avoid crossing wires for the final sensor module’s assembly.
Table 2.3      Gain Polarity
    Gain_Polarity Bit (BM_config [5])            Gain               Setting Description
                     0                            +1        No polarity change.
                     1                            -1        Gain polarity is inverted.
The inherent amplifier offset is suppressed by means of auto-zero and chopper techniques.
The optimal gain (and offset) setup for a specific sensor element can be determined by these steps:
     1) Collect sensor element’s characteristic, statistical data (across temperature, ambient sensor parameters,
         and production tolerances):
              a. Minimum differential output voltage:         Vmin
              b. Maximum differential output voltage:          Vmax
         Remark: The best possible setup can only be determined if the absolute value of Vmax is higher than the
         absolute value of Vmin. If this is not the case, the gain polarity should be swapped.
     2) If Vmin and Vmax have different signs (normally, Vmax is positive and Vmin is negative), then the required
         ADC offset shift can be selected using the ratio: RatioOffset = |Vmin| / (Vmax – Vmin)
         In this case, the respective offset setup (A2D_offset) is the nearest integer of multiples of 1/16 in the
                                                                                   th
         range of 1/16 to 8/16 (see Table 2.8): A2D_offset = Round_to_x16 {RatioOffset}.

     3) Determine which of the two following cases is valid.
              a. If RatioOffset – A2D_offset ≤ 0 then calculate
                      Theoretical optimum gain: Gainopt =(1 – A2D_offset) * Vref / Vmax
              b. If RatioOffset – A2D_offset > 0 then calculate
                      Theoretical optimum gain: Gainopt = A2D_offset * Vref / |Vmin|
                                                                  with      Vref = Vrefp – Vrefn = 0.94 * VDDB,min ≈ 1.5V
          Then select the setup gain (Gainsetup) as nearest gain to Gainopt, whereas Gainsetup ≤ Gainopt.
2.3.2. Analog-to-Digital Converter
A second-order charge-balancing analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to convert the amplifier signal. To
allow optimizing the trade-off between conversion time and resolution, the conversion is split into a MSB coarse
conversion and an LSB fine conversion.
The final ADC resolution is determined by MSB + LSB. For the bridge measurement, the MSB-LSB segmentation
is programmable via the Msb and Lsb settings in the BM_config register (10HEX; see section 3.6.3) stored in the
MTP memory (see section 2.4.2). For the temperature measurement, the MSB-LSB segmentation is program-
mable via the Temp_ADC settings in the BM_config register.
                                              MSB     LSB
The conversion time is proportional to 2          +2 . During the MSB coarse conversion, the ADC input signal is
                             MSB
sampled and integrated 2          times, resulting in inherit low-pass behavior and noise suppression. The longer the
MSB coarse conversion is, the better the noise suppression. Possible settings are listed below in Table 2.4.

Useful MSB/LSB setups are with LSB = 0 (i.e., MSB-only conversions) or the combinations that result in
MSB + LSB ≤ 16. Resolutions beyond 16-bit mainly digitize the collected front-end noise and typically do not
improve the system performance. MSB/LSB segmentations with LSB > MSB are also not useful because typically
the resolution remains the same as with the inverse MSB/LSB segmentation but the noise performance becomes
significantly worse yet the required conversion time stays the same.
The ADC conversion times for different MSB/LSB settings are listed in Table 2.6. Settings shown with pink
shading are preferred settings with the best balance between conversion time and noise.

   1)  Reference noise values obtained with this setup: 13.7kΩ sensor bridge, 25°C, Gain=64, A2D_offset shift=-1/16 through 15/16, VDD=1.8V.
The ADC offset is programmable in eight steps so that the ADC input voltage range can be adapted to the voltage
range at the input pins INP and INN. Possible ADC input voltages are shown in Figure 2.2, where VAGND = VDDB/2.
The ADC offset is controlled by the A2D_Offset setting in the Measurement Configuration Register (BM_config:
10HEX; see section 3.6.3) in the MTP memory (see section 2.4.2). The ADC offset settings are listed in Table 2.8.
See Table 1.4 for typical values for Vrefn and Vrefp.

2.3.3. Temperature Measurement
The ZSSC3026 provides an internal resistive temperature sensor measurement to allow compensation for
temperature effects. See section 1.3 for the temperature sensor resolution. The temperature output signal is a
differential voltage that is adapted by the amplifier for the ADC input.
For temperature measurements, the ADC offset and amplifier gain setting are defined by IDT. The ADC MSB/LSB
segmentation is programmable by the user for optimizing resolution or conversion time (see section 2.3.2).
2.3.4. Bridge Supply
The ZSSC3026 provides dedicated bridge supply pins VDDB and VSSB. The ADC reference voltages for the
sensor bridge measurement are derived from these internal voltages so that bridge supply disturbances are
suppressed. The current drive ability of VDDB is limited (see IVDDB in section 1.2).
2.4.      Digital Section
2.4.1.      Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Core
The DSP Core block performs the algorithm for correcting the sensor signal. The resulting coefficients are stored
in the MTP memory. When the measurement results are available, the "end of conversion" signal is set at the
EOC pin. The internal EOC information is valid only if both the measurement and calculation have been com-
pleted.
2.4.2.      MTP Memory
The ZSSC3026’s memory is designed with an OTP (one-time programmable) structure. The memory is organized
in 4 one-time programmable pages. When data in the currently valid memory page is to be updated, normally a
new page must be selected by increasing the page counter and the whole memory contents must be written in its
updated version. The user has access to a 24x 16-bit storage area for values such as calibration coefficients.
Dedicated calibration values are stored in an area not accessible to the user. The required programming voltage
is generated internally in the ZSSC3026 whereas increased ZSSC3026 power supply requirements must be
fulfilled during programming (see “Memory Programming Voltage” in section 1.3). There is no over-write or erase
function for the MTP memory.
The physical memory function is such that each single bit that has not yet been set to 1 (i.e., remains 0) can still
be changed to 1, so it is possible to (partially) re-program an MTP register as shown in the following example:
          •    Assume MTP-address 11HEX was written with 8421HEX which is 1000 0100 0010 0001BIN
          •    As an example, changing the register contents to A6A7HEX (i.e., 1010 0110 1010 0111binary) can be
               achieved by either writing A6A7HEX (any already written bit will be ignored automatically) or just writing
               the difference compared to 8421HEX, which is 2286HEX.
The contents of a re-written register can generally be determined by
          contentRegister = contentold (BITWISE_OR) contentnew
If contentRegister equals contentnew, a re-write is possible; e.g. this is not the case for contentold = FFFFHEX and
contentnew ≠ FFFFHEX. Depending on the former and the newly intended MTP address and register contents, a
re-programming could be possible.

2.4.3.         Clock Generator
The clock generator, implemented as a ring oscillator, provides a 4MHz clock signal. The frequency is trimmed
during production test.
2.4.4.         Power Supervision
The power supervision block, a section of the voltage regulator combined with the digital section, monitors all
power supplies to ensure a defined reset of all digital blocks during power-up or power supply interruptions.
2.4.5.         Interface
                                                                                                   2           *
The ZSSC3026 can communicate with the user’s PC via an SPI or I C™ interface . The interface type is select-
able via the voltage level on the SEL pin:
     •    SEL = 0 → SPI Mode
          SEL = 1 → I C™ Mode
                           2
     •
If the SEL pin is not connected, I²C™ communication will be selected (ZSSC3026-internal pull-up at SEL pin).
The SPI-specific pins (SS, MISO) do not need to be connected at all for I²C™ operation.
To also provide interface accessibility in Sleep State (all features inactive except for the digital interface logic), the
interface circuitry is directly supplied by VDD.
*. Functional I2C™ interface properties correspond to the NXP I²C™ bus specification revision 0.3 (June 2009).

3      Functional Description
3.1.     Power Up
Specifications for this section are given in sections 1.2 and 1.3. On power-up, the ZSSC3026 communication
interface is able to receive the first command after a time tSTA1 from when the VDD supply is within operating
specifications. The ZSSC3026 can begin the first measurement after a time of tSTA2.from when the VDD supply is
operational. The wake-up time from Sleep State to Active State (see section 3.3) after receiving the activating
command is defined as tWUP1 and tWUP2. In Command Mode, subsequent commands can be sent after tWUP1. The
first measurement starts after tWUP2 if measurement request was sent.
3.2.     Measurements
Available measurement procedures are
    • AZBM: auto-zero bridge measurement
    • BM: bridge measurement
    • AZTM: auto-zero temperature measurement
    • TM: temperature measurement
AZBM: The configuration for bridge measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer connects the amplifier input to the
AGND analog ground reference. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed so that the inherent system offset
for the bridge configuration is converted by the ADC to a 16-bit digital word.
BM: The configuration for bridge measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer connects the amplifier input to the
bridge pins INP and INN. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed. The result is a 16-bit digital word.
AZTM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer connects the Amplifier input
to AGND. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed so that the inherent system offset for the temperature
configuration is converted by the ADC to a 16-bit digital word.
TM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer connects the Amplifier input to
the internal temperature sensor. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed. The result is a 16-bit digital word.
The typical application’s measurement cycle is a complete SSC measurement (using the command ACHEX) with
AZBM, BM, AZTM, and TM followed by a signal correction calculation.
3.3.     Operational Modes
Figure 3.1 illustrates the ZSSC3026 power-up sequence and subsequent operation depending on the selected
                                    2
interface communication mode (I C™ or SPI). With either interface, after the voltage regulators are switched on,
the ZSSC3026’s low voltage section (LV) is active while the related interface configuration information is read
from memory. Then the LV section is switched off, the ZSSC3026 goes into Sleep State, and the interface is
ready to receive commands. The interface is always powered by VDD, so it is referred to as the high voltage
section (HV).
Figure 3.2 shows the ZSSC3026 operation in Normal Mode and Command Mode including when the LV and HV
sections are active as indicated by the color legend. The Normal Mode automatically returns to Sleep State after
executing the requested measurements. In Command Mode, the ZSSC3026 remains active if a dedicated
command (Start_NOM) was sent, which is helpful during calibration. Command Mode can only be entered if
Start_CM is the very first command after POR.

                2
3.4.1.     SPI/I C™ Commands
The user-accessible section of memory includes addresses 00HEX through 17HEX in the OTP memory that is
designated by the user memory page pointer. Because each of the four OTP memory pages cannot be rewritten
or erased, the memory page pointer must be incremented to the next OTP memory page in order to write to
memory again (see Table 3.1 for the command). After all four user-accessible OTP memory pages have been
used, further write operations are not possible and the “Memory Full” bit is returned as set in the status byte after
write operations (see section 3.5.1).
           2
The SPI/I C™ commands supported by the ZSSC3026 are listed in Table 3.1. The command to read an address
in the user memory is the same as its address. The command to read the 16-bit memory status of the data at an
address in user memory is the address plus 20HEX. The command to write to an address in user memory is the
address plus 40HEX.
There is a IDT-reserved section of memory, which can be read but not over-written by the user.

3.5.     Communication Interface
3.5.1.       Common Functionality
Commands are handled by the command interpreter in the LV section. Commands which need additional data are
not treated differently than other commands because the HV interface is able to buffer the command and all data
that belongs to the command, and the command interpreter is activated as soon as a command byte is received.
Every response starts with a status byte followed by the data word. The data word depends on the previous
                                                                                                                                      2
command. It is possible to read the same data more than once if the read request is repeated (I C™) or a NOP
command is sent (SPI). If the next command is not a read request (I²C™) or a NOP (SPI), it invalidates any
previous data.

The status byte contains the following bits (see Table 3.3, Table 3.4, and Table 3.5 for sequence):
   • Power indication (bit 6): 1 if the device is powered (VDDB on); 0 if not powered. This is needed for SPI Mode
       where the master reads all zeros if the device is not powered or in power-on reset (POR).
   • Busy indication (bit 5): 1 if the device is busy, which indicates that the data for the last command is not

   • Actual ZSSC3026 mode (bits 4:3): 00 = Normal Mode; 01 = Command Mode; 1X = IDT-reserved.
   • Memory integrity/error flag (bit 2): 0 if integrity test passed, 1 if test failed. This bit indicates whether the
       checksum-based integrity check passed or failed. Correctable errors are not reported but can be queried
       with the memory status commands (see section 3.6.2). The memory error status bit is calculated only
       during the power-up sequence, so a newly written CRC will only be used for memory verification and status
       update after a subsequent ZSSC3026 power-on reset (POR).
   • Data transfer/correction (bit 1): If the last command was a memory write, this bit is 0 if the last memory
       write was successful (memory not full yet); otherwise it is 1 (e.g., page increase but being already on last
       MTP page). If the last command was a memory read, this bit is 1 if the data was corrected.

3.5.2.       SPI
The SPI Mode is available when the SEL pin = 0. The polarity and phase of the SPI clock are programmable via
the CKP_CKE setting in address 02HEX as described in Table 3.8. CKP_CKE is two bits: CPHA (bit 10), which
selects which edge of SCLK latches data, and CPOL (bit 11), which indicates whether SCLK is high or low when it
is idle. The polarity of the SS signal and pin are programmable via the SS_polarity setting (bit 9). The different
combinations of polarity and phase are illustrated in the figures below.

All mandatory I²C™ bus protocol features are implemented. Optional features such as clock stretching, 10-bit
slave address, etc., are not supported by the ZSSC3026’s interface.
In I²C™ High Speed Mode, a command consists of a fixed length of three bytes.
3.6.     Memory
In the ZSSC3026, the memory is organized page-wise and can be programmed multiple (4) times (MTP). Each
register can only be programmed once per page. The valid page is determined by the page counter, which can be
incremented with the command 5EHEX, which results in a “reset” of all registers and a re-programming is neces-
sary. Increasing the customer page counter will disable all old register contents of the former page. It is possible
to (re-)program a total of 4 pages. Resetting the page counter is not possible. The page counter starts with 0 and
                                                    th
can be incremented to a maximum of 3. If the 4 memory page has been used, no further changes in the memory
are possible – careful writing and page incrementing is strongly recommended.
There are two MTP page types:
  • Customer Page: accessible by means of regular write operations (40HEX to 57HEX). It contains the customer
                          ID, interface setup data, measurement setup information, calibration coefficients, etc.
  • IDT Page:             only accessible for write operations by IDT. The IDT page contains specific trim
                          information and is programmed during manufacturing test by IDT.

3.6.1.      Programming Memory
Programming memory requires a specific supply voltage level (>2.9V) at VDD pin (see section 1.3 for
specifications). The MTP programming voltage itself is generated by means of an integrated charge pump; no
additional, external voltage, other than VDD is needed. The program timing is shown in Figure 3.11, where tVPP is
the wait time until the memory has been programmed and the next command can be applied (typically 0.6µs).
Supplying the ZSSC3026 with VDD>2.9V during memory programming is required. After the memory is
programmed, it must be read again to verify the validity of the memory content.

3.7.     Calibration Sequence
Calibration essentially involves collecting raw signal and temperature data from the sensor-ZSSC3026 system for
different known bridge values and temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the calibration master
(assumed to be a PC), and the calculated calibration coefficients can then be written to MTP memory. Below is a
brief overview of the steps involved in calibrating the ZSSC3026.
There are three main steps to calibration:
      1. Assigning a unique identification to the ZSSC3026. This identification is written to shadow RAM and later
          programmed in MTP memory. This unique identification can be stored in the two 16-bit registers
          dedicated to customer ID. It can be used as an index in a database stored on the calibration PC. This
          database will contain all the raw values of bridge readings and temperature readings for that part, as well
          as the known bridge measurand conditions and temperature to which the bridge was exposed.
      2. Data collection. Data collection involves getting uncorrected or raw data from the bridge at different
          known measurand values and temperatures. Then this data is stored on the calibration PC using the
          unique identification of the device as the index to the database.
      3. Coefficient calculation and storage in MTP memory. After enough data points have been collected to
          calculate all the desired coefficients, the coefficients can be calculated by the calibrating PC and written
          to the shadow RAM. After that, MTP memory is programmed with the contents of the shadow RAM.
      4. Result. The sensor signal and the characteristic temperature effect on output will be linearized according
          to the setup-dependent maximum output range.
It is essential to perform the calibration with a fixed programming setup during the data collection phase. In order
to prevent any accidental misprocessing, it is further recommended to keep the MTP memory setup stable during
the whole calibration process as well as in the subsequent operation. A ZSSC3026 calibration only fits the single
setup used during its calibration. Changes in functional parameters after a successful calibration can decrease
the precision and accuracy performance of the ZSSC3026 as well as of the whole application.
3.7.1.      Calibration Step 1 – Assigning Unique Identification
Assign a unique identification number to the ZSSC3026 by using the memory write command (40HEX + data and
41HEX + data; see Table 3.1 and Table 3.8) to write the identification number to Cust_ID0 at memory address
00HEX and Cust_ID1 at address 01HEX as described in section 3.6.1. These two 16-bit registers allow for more than
4 billion unique devices.
3.7.2.      Calibration Step 2 – Data Collection
The number of unique points (measurand and/or temperature) at which calibration must be performed generally
depends on the requirements of the application and the behavior of the resistive bridge in use. The minimum
number of points required is equal to the number of bridge coefficients to be corrected with a minimum of three
different temperatures at three different bridge values. For a full calibration resulting in values for all 7 possible
bridge coefficients and 3 possible temperature coefficients, a minimum of 7 pairs of bridge with temperature
measurements must be collected.

                                                                                                             ZSSC3026
Within this minimum 3x3 measurements field, data must be collected for the specific value pairs at known
conditions and then processed to calculate the coefficients. In order to obtain the potentially best and most robust
coefficients, it is recommended that measurement pairs (temperature vs. measurand) be collected at the outer
corners of the intended operation range or at least at points that are located far from each other. It is also
essential to provide highly precise reference values as nominal, expected values. The measurement precision of
the external calibration-measurement equipment should be ten times more accurate than the expected
ZSSC3026 output precision after calibration in order to avoid precision losses caused by the nominal reference
values (e.g., measurand signal and temperature deviations).
Note: An appropriate selection of measurement pairs can significantly improve the overall system performance.
The determination of the measurand-related coefficients will use all of the measurement pairs. For the
temperature-related correction coefficients, 3 (at three different temperatures) of the measurement pairs will be
used.
Note: There is an inherent redundancy in the 7 bridge-related and 3 temperature-related coefficients. Since the
temperature is a necessary output (which also needs correction), the temperature-related information is mathe-
matically separated, which supports faster and more efficient DSP calculations during the normal usage of the
sensor-ZSSC3026 system.
The recommended approach for data collection is to make use of the raw-measurement commands:
         •    For bridge sensor values:
              o    A2HEX + 0000HEX: Single bridge measurement for which the configuration register will be loaded
                                        from the BM_config register (10HEX in MTP); preprogramming the measure-
                                        ment setup in the MTP is required.
              o    A3HEX + ssssHEX: Single bridge measurement for which the BM_config configuration register
                                        (Gain, ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded as ssssHEX and must be provided
                                        externally via the interface.
         •    For temperature values:
              o    A6HEX + 0000HEX: Single temperature measurement for which the configuration register will be
                                        loaded from an internal temperature configuration register (preprogrammed by
                                        IDT in MTP); preprogramming of the respective configuration is done by IDT
                                        prior to ZSSC3026 delivery. This is the recommended approach for
                                        temperature data collection.
              o    A7HEX + ssssHEX: Single temperature measurement for which the configuration register (Gain,
                                        ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded as ssssHEX and must be provided externally
                                        via the interface. The data composition of the temperature configuration
                                        register is similar to the BM_config (address 10HEX) register for the bridge
                                        sensor.
3.7.3.     Calibration Step 3 – Coefficient Calculations
The math to perform the coefficient calculation is complicated and will not be discussed in detail. There is a brief
overview in the next section. IDT will provide software (DLLs) to perform the coefficient calculation (external to the
sensor-ZSSC3026 system) based on auto-zero corrected values. After the coefficients are calculated, the final
step is to write them to the MTP memory of the ZSSC3026.

3.8.    The Calibration Math
3.8.1.      Bridge Signal Compensation
The saturation check in the ZSSC3026 is enhanced compared with older SSCs from IDT. Even saturation effects
of the internal calculation steps are detected, allowing the final correction output to still be determined. It is
possible to get potentially useful signal conditioning results that have seen an intermediate saturation during the
calculations – these cases are detectable by observing the status bit[0] for each measurement result. Details
about the saturation limits and the valid ranges for values are provided in the following equations.
SOT_curve selects whether second-order equations compensate for sensor nonlinearity with a parabolic or
S-shaped curve. The parabolic compensation is recommended.
The correction formula for the differential signal reading is represented as a two-step process depending on the
SOT_curve setting.
For the following measurand equations, the terms are as follows:
                                                             2

    Offset_B        =   Bridge offset term; range [-1FFFFHEX to 1FFFFHEX]

    T_Raw           =   Raw temperature reading after AZ correction; range [-1FFFFHEX to 1FFFFHEX]
    TSETL           =   T_Raw reading at which low calibration was performed (e.g., 25°C);
                        range [-FFFFHEX to FFFFHEX]
    SOT_tcg         =   Second-order term for Tcg non-linearity; range [-1FFFFHEX to 1FFFFHEX]

3.8.2.        Temperature Signal Compensation
Temperature is measured internally. Temperature correction contains both linear gain and offset terms as well as
a second-order term to correct for any nonlinearities. For temperature, second-order compensation for non-
linearity is always parabolic. The correction formula is best represented as a two-step process as follows:
