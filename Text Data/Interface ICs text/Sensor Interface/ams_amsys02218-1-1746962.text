Buffer Pin CDC
An external buffer capacitor with a recommended value of 100nF should be connected to this pin to ensure a sufficiently high input
impedance Z at power supply pin LTGP.
Voltage at this pin can be as high as VLTGP.
Nom. 24V Power Supply Output UOUT
The supply output voltage at UOUT is directly derived from VLTGP and regulated to a level with an offset of about -6V relative to
VLTGP.
UOUT provides bias to the sensors and actuators circuitry connected to the slave device as well as to the LEDs connected to
outputs LED1 and LED2.
UOUT is equipped with a thermal overload protection, which foresees that VUOUT is switched off as soon as the slave device’s
substrate temperature TJ passes a threshold value in the range of (155 ±20)°C.
After TJ has come down and has passed a temperature threshold about (15 ±5)°C lower than (155 ±20)°C and after a consecutive
minimum delay time of 1s has elapsed, VUOUT is switched on again.

Nom. 5V Power Supply Output U5R
The voltage at U5R is derived from the voltage present at UOUT, as long as UOUT is not switched off due to overload. In the latter
case U5R is derived from an alternative voltage out of the UOUT voltage regulator, which is more or less similar to VUOUT in non
switched off condition of UOUT. As a result VU5R is not affected by overload condition at UOUT and will remain.

AS2702 – AS-Interface Slave IC
Data Port Pins D3, …, D0 and Data Strobe Pin DSTBn
Basically data port D3, …, D0 is designed for bidirectional data transfer out of and into the slave device. Each data port pin is
equipped with both a low-side open-drain output stage as well as an input stage to this purpose.
Depending on the so-called IO-configuration code, written and stored in the slave device, each data port pin is individually set to
behave as
•     output, or
•     output/input, or
•     input.
The timing of the data transfer is presented in Figure 3.
Strobe signal DSTBn flags and governs the data transfer as follows:
a) data port pin is set ‘output’:
      output data become valid upon the HL-edge of the strobe and will remain so until the next HL-edge, hence during the entire
      strobe cycle;
b) data port pin is set ‘output/input’:
      output data become valid upon the HL-edge of the strobe and will remain so until it’s LH-edge; input data to be valid within a
      specific time window relative to the HL-edge, after completion of the strobe’s L-phase;
c) data port pin is set ‘input’:
      input data to be valid within a specific time window relative to the HL-edge of the strobe, after completion of the strobe’s
      L-phase.
If necessary, output data as per a) and b) can be easily latched with the LH-edge of strobe DSTBn as they will remain valid for
about 0.4µs beyond as a minimum.
Care must be taken however, that signal delay added by external circuitry is lower for the strobe than for the data.

To govern the data transfer at data port D3, …,D0 strobe pin DSTBn is equipped with a low-side open-drain output switch plus a
passive high-side current source with a nom. 10µA pull-up current capability.
However a second function is assigned to the DSTBn pin which requires it to be input as well: if a low-pulse is imposed on DSTBn
by external means with a pulse width of at least 50 to 100ms, the slave device will be put in RESET condition, as described in

Notes:
1     DSTBn is equipped with an on-chip pull-up current source, which ensures a sufficiently fast LH-edge upon output switch-off in
      open-pin condition, to prevent erroneous RESET triggering. If DSTBn has an external load connected to it, an additional
      external pull-up resistor may be needed to prevent erroneous RESET triggering upon output switch-off.

The transfer of data at P3, …, P0 and the supporting strobe action at pin PSTBn takes place similarly as at D3, …, D0 resp. DSTBn.

side current source with a nom. 10 µA pull-up current capability, and with an input stage.

2     No hysteresis implemented
Though equipped for bidirectional data transfer as D3, …, D0, the parameter port is nevertheless less flexible than the data port.
Note the following differences:
a) The parameter port is set portwise, the data port bitwise by the IO-configuration code;
b) The parameter port can only be set to either ‘output’ or ‘input’. A bidirectional behaviour within a strobe cycle is not possible;
c) The parameter port is set to ‘output’ as a rule; the only exception occurs in case of IO-configuration 7 and a master data
      request, which set it to ‘input’.
To govern the data transfer at the parameter port P3, …, P0 strobe pin PSTBn is equipped with a low-side open-drain output switch
plus a passive high-side current source with a nom. 10µA pull-up current capability. Typically the PSTBn-strobe width is about 6µs
see Figure 4. (However to simplify and shorten the component test time of the slave device, the PSTBn pin is also used as an input.
Input low pulses of more than 50µs each will step and cycle the device through 3 different test modes beyond the regular operation
as described in this datasheet.)
The dc- and timing parameters of strobe pin PSTBn are specified as follows:

Notes:
1     PSTBn is equipped with an on-chip pull-up current source, which ensures a sufficiently fast LH-edge upon output switch-off in
      open-pin condition, to prevent erroneous test mode triggering.
      If PSTBn has an external load connected to it, an additional external pull-up resistor may be needed to prevent erroneous test
      mode triggering upon output switch-off

Data Communication Watchdog
AS2702 is equipped with a watchdog timer to supervise data communication by monitoring the strobe signals at pins DSTBn and
PSTBn.
If a parameter or data strobe is not followed by a consecutive strobe within a time period of 50 … 100ms, the watchdog is triggered
and initiates a ‘soft’ reset, see section Reset.
Reset
There are 2 categories of reset-events, leading to 2 slightly different reset-conditions of the slave device:
1     A ‘hard’ reset taking place at power-up and power-down of supply-voltages U5R and UOUT.
      At power-up the slave device leaves reset-condition as soon as U5R has passed 3.75V and UOUT has passed VCOMOFF =
      nom. 10V.
      At power-down the slave device is forced into reset-condition as soon as U5R drops below 3.75V.
      (Tolerance of the threshold voltages referred to is ±5 %)
2     A ‘soft’ reset, resulting from one of the following events:
      2.1     Data strobe pin DSTBn is kept L for more than 100ms;
      2.2     Master command ‘RESET SLAVE’ is received;
      2.3     Master command ‘RESET BROADCAST’ is received;
      2.4     The communication watchdog is triggered.
Revision 1.3, 21-Aug-08                                                                                                  Page 10 of 13


AS2702 – AS-Interface Slave IC
A ‘hard’ reset event conditions the slave device as follows:
•     Internal states (counters, flags, …) are reset
•     The slave device’s receiver is desynchronized from the AS-Interface bus
•     The low-side open-drain output stages at ports D3, …, D0 and ports P3, …, P0 are switched off
•     Any test mode will be cancelled
A ‘soft’ reset has the following consequences:
•     A regular, nominal 6µs L-phase strobe is generated on both the DSTBn and PSTBn pin
•     The low-side open-drain output stages at ports D3, …, D0 and ports P3, …, P0 are switched off
•     Internal states (counters, flags, …) are rest, however the following states and operations are not affected:
      – the timer function which controls blinking of LED1 and LED2
      – the data communication
      – any test mode
      – any EEPROM write operation
Remark:
If UOUT drops below VCOMOFF = nom. 10V data communication with the AS-Interface bus is aborted by the receiver or transmitter
of the slave device. As long as U5R does not drop below 3.75V in this situation, no ‘hard’ reset takes place; however the data
communication watchdog will be triggered (unless disabled) and a ‘soft’ reset will result.
EEPROM
AS2702 has a 16 x 8 Bits serial interface EEPROM on board to store the slave unit’s address and set-up data in a non-volatile
fashion.
The EEPROM stores the following data:
  EEPROM-Address             Data                      Relevant No. of Bits      Programmed by               Note

  3                          Settings (IO-Conf.)       5                         Slave unit manufacturer
  4                          Settings (ID)             5                         Slave unit manufacturer
  5                          Settings (EID2)           5                         Slave unit manufacturer
  6                          Settings (Control-Code)   5                         Slave unit manufacturer
Note:
1     6 Bits (A4, …, A0 + Sel-bit) in extended address mode: 62 slaves addressable;
      5 Bits (A4, …, A0) in non-extended address mode: 31 slaves addressable
Obviously the capacity of the EEPROM is only partially used.
Reading and writing of the EEPROM is performed bytewise and trough temporary, volatile registers.
Writing of data from the volatile register into the EEPROM takes about 10ms per byte, whereas reading takes less than 1ms per
byte.
Upon RESET the EEPROM info is read into temporary register, including the slave’s address which has been written redundantly
into EEPROM locations 0 and 1 before.
The temporary registers receiving the address are compared for similarity; in case of non-similarity – which e.g. may have been
caused by a supply voltage dip during address writing – the slave will flag non-regular operation status/slave address zero.

AS2702 – AS-Interface Slave IC
AS-Interface Bus Communication
All slaves connected to an AS-Interface bus are sequentially and cyclicly called by the master in a string of individual transactions
between the master and each slave unit.
A transaction consists of a 14 bits master request, typically containing the slave’s address as well as data or parameter info, and an
immediate acknowledging slave response of 7 bits.
The 14 bits master request – apart from Start Bit ST = 0 and End Bit EB = 1 – has the following contents:
•     1 Control Bit CB:        CB = 0 stands for data transfer (typ. data or parameters)
                               CB = 1 identifies command-type requests
•     5 Address Bits:          A4, …, A0
•     5 Information Bits:      I4, …, I0 (typ. data or parameters)
•     1 Parity Bit PB
AS2702 allows for up to 62 slaves on the same AS-Interface bus; this requires a slave address extended to 6 bits, hence an extra
bit beyond A4, …, A0.
Information bit I3 is used as the 6 th address bit in this so-called extended address mode. It is called Sel-bit, as it is perceived as to
select between A-slave (Sel = 0) and B-slave (Sel = 1) at address location A4, …, A0.
In non-extended address mode AS2702 is addressed with A4, …, A0 only – for a max. total of 31 slaves per AS-Interface bus
system, and is system compatible with existing slave device AS2701A.
The 7 bits slave response – apart from Start Bit ST = 0 and End Bit EB = 1 – has the following contents:
•     4 Information Bits:      I4, …, I0 (typ. data or parameters)
•     1 Parity Bit PB
