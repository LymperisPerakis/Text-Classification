5. General Description
The MLX90328 covers the most typical resistive type of Wheatstone bridge applications for use in an automotive
environment. It is a mixed signal sensor interface IC that converts small changes in resistors, configured in a full
Wheatstone bridge on a sensing element, to large output voltage variations.
The signal conditioning includes gain adjustment, offset control as well as temperature compensation in order to
accommodate variations of the different resistive sensing elements. Compensation values are stored in EEPROM
and can be reprogrammed with a Melexis tool including the necessary software. The MLX90328 is programmed
with a single wire serial interface through the output pin.

  A maximum performance can be obtained with this sensor sensitivity range. A programmable gain with 5 bits from a gain of 9 to 237 is used in the analog
front end circuitry to adapt the sensor range to the on chip ADC input range. Half of the ADC input range (= 1.75V) is foreseen to be used during the sensor
calibration at the first temperature. The rest of the ADC input range is left for the compensation of the sensor temperature effects. A coarse offset
compensation is available to calibrate large sensor offsets.
A more detailed overview of the gains in the analog frontend can be found in Table 6.

10. Filters
There are two filters available to filter the pressure signal. The first filter is a Small Signal Filter which can be
disabled or enabled. The second filter is a first order low pass filter for the pressure signal which has a
programmable depth.
10.1. PFLT
PFLT is a programmable first order low pass filter. The depth of this filter can be selected. This filter can be
configured to select the optimal trade-off between response time and output noise.
The low pass filter is implemented according to the following formula:
                                                               ( )                          ( )
                                       ( )                                                      (    )
The PFLT parameter in the formula is set in EEPROM and can have a value between 0 and 9. An overview of
typical response times when applying a step on the input using different PFLT filter settings can be found in Table
5. Filter setting 0 disables the PFLT.
                                                                              Response time

10.2. SSF
The SSF (Small Signal Filter) is a digital filter which is designed not to have an impact on the response time of a
fast changing pressure signal like a pressure step. When a large signal change at the input is present, the filter is
bypassed and not filtering the signal. For small signal changes, which are in most cases noise, the filter is used
and filtering the pressure signal.
The Small Signal Filter can be enabled or disabled in EEPROM.

11. Analog Front End
The analog front end of the MLX90328 consists of a chopping stage and 3 amplification stages as can be seen in
Figure 2. There are also several input diagnostics integrated into this front end to be able to detect a broken InP
or InN connection or an input which is out of range. This diagnostic information is transferred to the
microcontroller to handle further action for example flagging a diagnostic message.
                                                                               G = 1.25 or 3.5

The first stage is an instrumentation amplifier of which the gain can be programmed using 3 bits to cover a gain
range between 4.5 and 10.6.
Transfer equation:
OUTP1 – OUTN1 = Gst1*(InP – InN) in phase 1
OUTP1 – OUTN1 = Gst1*(InN – InP) in phase 2
The second stage is a fully differential amplifier. The gain of the amplifier can be calibrated using 1 bit.
Transfer equation:
OUTP2 – OUTN2 = -Gst2*(OUTP1 – OUTN1) – Gst2*(CSOF1 – CSOF2) in phase 1
OUTP2 – OUTN2 = -Gst2*(OUTN1 – OUTP1) – Gst2*(CSOF2 – CSOF1) in phase 2
The CSOF1 and CSOF2 signals are generated by the coarse offset DAC with the following transfer functions:
                                   2 1  VDDA CO[6 : 0]

CO[6:0] fixes the DAC output. CO7 is used for the polarity.
The third stage is an integrator which is controlled using 2 bits to set a gain between 1.6 and 6.4
Transfer equation at the outputs of the amplifier:
OUTP3 – OUTN3 = -N*(C1/C2)*(OUTP2 – OUTN2)
OUTP3_common_mode and OUTN3_common_mode = VCM = VDDA/2
In this equation N represents the number of integration cycles which is a fixed value of N = 40.
C2 is a fixed feedback capacitor of approximately 5pF. C1 can have 3 different values: 0.2pF, 0.4pF or 0.8pF.
Transfer equation after the ADC:
Pressure_ADC = ((OUTN3 – OUTP3)*216/VDDA) + 32768

12. ADC
The 16 bit differential ADC has a range from –VDDA/2 to +VDDA/2.
There are 7 different ADC channels. Channel 0 is not used. Table 7 below describes all the channels.

The different channels are converted in a constantly repeating sequence. A new ADC conversion is done every
50us following the sequence shown below in Figure 3. This is resulting in an updated pressure output value every
200us.

13. Digital
The digital is built around a 16-bit microcontroller. It contains besides the processor also ROM, RAM and EEPROM
and a set of user and system IO registers.
Temperature compensation of the pressure signal and pressure linearization is handled by the microcontroller.
For the pressure compensation there are EEPROM parameters allocated to be able to cover a large variety of
calibration approaches.
Both for gain and offset of the pressure signal, there is a separate temperature dependency programmable
ranging from a temperature independence to a first order, second order and finally a third order compensation.
This is reflected in EEPROM parameters for the offset (O0, O1, O2 and O3) and for the gain (G0, G1, G2 and G3). If
required, the linearity of the pressure signal can also be compensated without a temperature dependency or
with a first order temperature dependency through EEPROM parameters L0 and L1.
For the temperature compensation of the pressure signal both the internal on-chip temperature as the
temperature measured using the sensor bridge resistance can be used. The selection between both can be set in
EEPROM using the ‘Tpress Select’ parameter. When using the bridge resistance temperature measurement, a

16. Unique Features
Thanks to its state of the art mixed signal chain, the MLX90328 offers the possibility to calibrate several types of
resistive Wheatstone bridge technologies allowing the MLX90328 users to reach an outstanding overall sensor
accuracy. The MLX90328 is robust for harsh automotive environments like large temperature range, overvoltage
conditions and external EMC disturbances.
The MLX90328 allows the compensation of sensor nonlinear variations over temperature as well as compensates
for the sensor pressure signal non linearity. Several parameters can be programmed through the application pins
in the MLX90328 to set clamping levels or filter settings to choose for the best trade-off between signal chain
noise and speed. The MLX90328 can also diagnose several error conditions like sensor connections errors.
The sensor bias Vbrg which is supplying the external pressure sensor is generated using a regulator. The target
sensor supply is 6/7VDDA or typically 3V. The current through the bridge resistance is mirrored and divided so
that it can be fed to an IV convertor. The division ratio is depending on the EEPROM selection bit IVSEL which
chooses a different ratio for a 2K, 4K, 8K or a 32K sensor bridge. This IV converted signal is a measure for the
external temperature so that it can be used for the calibration of the pressure sensor. A short circuit protection is
foreseen on the pin Vbrg.

17. Application Information
The MLX90328 only needs 2 capacitors in the application. A 100nF decoupling capacitor connected between the
supply line and the ground a 100nF load between the analog output pin and the ground.
MLX90328 has built in EMC protection for the sensor supply and sensing element input pins. Therefore it is
advised not to place any external capacitors between the sensing element and the interface. Capacitors on the
sensor supply or the inputs can even disturb the normal operation of the interface.
These recommendations for external components are however only providing a basic protection. Depending on
the module design and the EMC requirements different configurations can be needed.
