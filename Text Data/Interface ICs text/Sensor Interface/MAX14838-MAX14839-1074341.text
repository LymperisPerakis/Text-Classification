Note 1: All units are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: Currents into the device as positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to ground, unless
         otherwise noted.
Note 3: See the DO Short-Circuit and Overcurrent Protection section for detailed information.
Note 4: ESD protection for VCC is achieved only with an external capacitor connected from VCC to GND. Connect 100nF capacitor
         between VCC and GND for air-gap and contact discharge ESD.
