Note  1:  All devices 100% production tested at TA = +25ºC. Limits over operating temperature range are guaranteed by design.
Note  2:  Currents out of the device are negative. Currents into the device are positive.
Note  3:  Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note  4:  VDROP is measured as the voltage from the driver output to GND (VDRIVER - VGND) when measuring the low-side driver-
          current limit and as (V24 - VDRIVER) when measuring the high-side current limit.
Note 5: SDA/WU always asserts when a valid wake-up condition is received when operating in pin mode. When operating the
          device in I2C mode, WU/IRQ asserts for tWUL only when no interrupts have been registered (INTERRUPT register) and the
          WUM = 1 in the IRQMASK register. If WUM = 0, WUINT is set when a valid wake-up event is detected and WU/IRQ asserts
          until the INTERRUPT register is read.

    17         C4          LIN    possible. Connect LIN to V24 or to an external supply between 8V and 36V. Short LIN to V5 to
                                  disable the internal regulator. Connect 5V to LIN and V5 when the internal regulator is disabled.
                                  5V Linear Regulator Output/Supply Input. Bypass V5 to GND with a 1μF capacitor as close
                                  to the device as possible. V5 is the output of the internal 5V linear regulator. To disable the

                                  internal regulator, connect LIN to V5. 5V is required on V5 for normal operation. If the 5V
                                  regulator is disabled, apply an external 5V power supply to V5.

 CONTROL INTERFACE
                                  IO-Link Wake-Up Detection/Interrupt Open-Drain Output.
                                  I2C Mode: WU/IRQ asserts low when a valid IO-Link wake-up is detected on the C/Q line or
     2         B4        WU/IRQ   when a bit in the INTERRUPT register is set.
                                  Pin mode: WU/IRQ asserts low when a thermal or overcurrent fault occurs. WU/IRQ deas-
                                  serts when the fault is no longer present.
                                  I2C Address Select/MCLK Enable Input.
                                  I2C Mode: Connect A0/CLKEN high or low to set the I2C address for the MAX22515. See

                                  Pin mode: Drive A0/CLKEN high to enable the clock output on MCLK. Drive A0/CLKEN low
                                  to disable the clock output. MCLK is 14.74MHz (typ) in pin mode. MCLK is high impedance
                                  when disabled.
                                  I2C Serial Clock/C/Q Driver Current Limit Setting Input.

Wake-Up Pulse Generation (I2C Mode Only)
In I2C mode, the MAX22515 can generate a wake-up pulse.
To prepare the transceiver to generate a wake-up pulse,
set the C/Q driver in receive mode (CQ_EN = 0 and
TXEN = low) and set the TX input high. Set the WURQ bit
in the WAKEUP register to generate the wake-up pulse.
