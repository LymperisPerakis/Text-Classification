The MAX6691 four-channel thermistor temperature-to-                            ♦ Simple Single-Wire Interface
pulse-width converter measures the temperatures of up
                                                                               ♦ Measures Up to Four Thermistor Temperatures
to four thermistors and converts them to a series of out-
put pulses whose widths are related to the thermistors’                        ♦ Low-Average Thermistor Current Minimizes Self-

external fixed resistor (REXT) form a voltage-divider that                     ♦ Internal Voltage Reference Isolates Thermistor
is driven by the MAX6691’s internal voltage reference                            from Power-Supply Noise
(VREF). VREF and the voltage across REXT are mea-
sured and converted to a pulse.                                                ♦ Accommodates Any Thermistor Temperature
                                                                                 Range
The MAX6691 has a single open-drain I/O pin that can
be readily connected to a variety of microcontrollers.
The microcontroller initiates a conversion by pulling the
I/O pin low and releasing it. When conversion is done,
the MAX6691 signals the end of conversion by pulling
the I/O pin low once again. The pulse corresponding to
the first thermistor is sent immediately after the release
of the I/O pin.
The on-chip power-management circuitry reduces the
average thermistor current to minimize errors due to
thermistor self-heating. Between conversions, the                                                      Ordering Information

          depends on the power dissipated and the dissipation          of the time:
          constant of the thermistor. Dissipation constants
          depend on the thermistor’s package and can vary con-           (1.22)2 (5325)(0.005) / (5325 + 5110)2 = 0.364µW, or

          A typical thermistor might have a dissipation constant
          equal to 1mW/°C. For every milliwatt the thermistor dis-
          sipates, its temperature rises by 1°C. For example, con-                                     Chip Information
