               warrant compliance at temperature extremes.

3.6       Interconnect Operation
The IO circuitry provides the means for the CO detector
to be connected to other CO detectors or smoke
alarms. Table 3-2 below provides the truth table for the
interconnect circuit operation. IO1 is a bidirectional pin
that connects to other CO detectors or smoke alarms.
IO2 is a bidirectional pin that connects to the
microcontroller. IODIR connects to the microcontroller
and determines when IO1 and IO2 act as an input or
output. When IO1 is used as an output asserting a logic
high, the IO1 output acts as current source that is
biased from VBST. In low-voltage applications where
the boost regulator is enabled, the boost regulator will
operate in High-Boost mode. When IO1 is used as an
output asserting a logic low, the IO1 output acts as
current sink. IO2 logic levels are referenced to VREG.

4.1                                 Boost Regulator
The boost regulator in High-Boost mode (nominal
VBST = 9.8V) can draw current pulses of greater than
1A and is, therefore, very sensitive to series resistance.
Critical components of this resistance are: the inductor
DC resistance, the internal resistance of the battery
and the resistance in the connections from the inductor
to the battery, from the inductor to the LX pin, from the
inductor through the boost capacitor, and from the VSS
pin to the battery. In order to function properly under full
load at VDD = 2V, the total of the inductor and intercon-
nect resistances should not exceed 0.3Ω. The internal
battery resistance should be no more than 0.5Ω and a
low ESR capacitor of 10 µF or more should be
connected in parallel with the battery to average the
current draw over the boost regulator switching cycle.
The Schottky diode and inductor should be specified
with a maximum operating current of 1.5A or higher.
The boost capacitor should have a low ESR.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
