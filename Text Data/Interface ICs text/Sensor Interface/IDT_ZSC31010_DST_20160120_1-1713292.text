1            Electrical Characteristics
1.1.         Absolute Maximum Ratings
Note: The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The device might not function or be operable above
the operating conditions given in section 1.2. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also
damage the device. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions
might affect device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute Maximum Ratings.”

 1)
    Note that the maximum EEPROM programming temperature is 85°C.
 2)
    If buying die, designers should use caution not to exceed maximum junction temperature by proper package selection.
 3)
    When using the output for digital calibration, no pull down resistor is allowed.
 4)
    For loads less than 20 kΩ to VSS an equivalent strength (or lower) pull-up resistor must be added.
 5)
    Using the output for digital calibration, CL,OUT is limited by the maximum rise time TZAC,rise.
 6)
    Note: Minimum bridge resistance is only a factor if using the Bsink feature. The nominal RDS(ON) of the Bsink transistor is 10 Ω when
    operating at VDD = 5 V, and 15 Ω when operating at VDD = 3.0 V. This does give rise to a ratiometricity inaccuracy that becomes greater
    with low bridge resistances.

1.4.          Analog Inputs versus Output Resolution
The ZSC31010 incorporates an extended 14-bit charge-balanced ADC, which allows for a single gain setting on
the pre-amplifier to handle bridge sensitivities from 1.2 to 36 mV/V while maintaining 8 to 12 bits of output reso-
lution with a default analog gain of 24. Selectable gain settings allow accommodating bridges with different
sensitivities. The tables below illustrate the minimum resolution achievable for a variety of bridge sensitivities. The
yellow shadowed fields indicate that for these input spans with the selected analog gain setting, the quantization
noise is higher than 0.1% FSO.

2         Circuit Description
2.1.      Signal Flow and Block Diagram
The ZSC31010 resistive bridge sensor interface ICs were specifically designed as a cost-effective solution for
sensing in building automation, industrial, office automation, and white goods applications. The RBicLite™ employs
IDT’s high precision bandgap with proportional-to-absolute temperature (PTAT) output; a low-power 14-bit
analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A2D, A-to-D); and an on-chip DSP core with EEPROM to precisely calibrate the
bridge output signal. Three selectable output modes, two analog and one digital, offer the ultimate in versatility
across many applications.
The ZSC31010 rail-to-rail ratiometric analog output Vout signal (0 to 5 V, Vout @ VDD = 5 V) suits most building
automation and automotive requirements. Typical office automation and white goods applications require the
0 to 1 Vout signal, which in the ZSC31010 is referenced to the internal bandgap. Direct interfacing to
microprocessor controllers is facilitated via IDT’s single-wire serial ZACwire™ digital interface.
The ZSC31010 is capable of running in high-voltage (5.5 to 30 V) systems when combined with an external JFET.

                                                                                                  ZSC31010 Datasheet
2.2.       Analog Front End
2.2.1.     Bandgap/PTAT and PTAT Amplifier
The highly linear Bandgap/PTAT provides the PTAT signal to the ADC, which allows accurate temperature con-
version. In addition, the ultra-low ppm-Bandgap provides a stable voltage reference over temperature for the
operation of the rest of the IC.
The PTAT signal is amplified through a path in the pre-amplifier (PREAMP) and fed to the ADC for conversion.
The most significant 12 bits of this converted result are used for temperature measurement and temperature
correction of bridge readings. When temperature is output in Digital Mode, only the most significant 8 bits are
given.
2.2.2.     Bridge Supply
The voltage driven bridge is usually connected to VDD and ground. As a power savings feature, the ZSC31010
also includes a switched transistor to interrupt the bridge current via the Bsink pin. The transistor switching is
synchronized to the A/D-conversion and released after finishing the conversion. To utilize this feature, the low
supply of the bridge should be connected to Bsink instead of ground.
Depending on the programmable update rate, the average current consumption (including bridge current) can be
reduced to approximately 20%, 5% or 1%.
2.2.3.     PREAMP Block
The differential signal from the bridge is amplified through a chopper-stabilized instrumentation amplifier with very
high input impedance, designed for low noise and low drift. This PREAMP provides gain for the differential signal
and re-centers its DC to VDD/2. The output of the PREAMP block is fed into the A/D-converter. The calibration
sequence performed by the digital core includes an auto-zero sequence to null any drift in the PREAMP state
over temperature.
The PREAMP is nominally set to a gain of 24. Other possible gain settings are 6, 12, and 48.
The inputs to the PREAMP from the VBN/VBP pins can be reversed via an EEPROM configuration bit.
2.2.4.     Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
                  nd
A 14-bit/1 ms 2 -order charge-balancing ADC is used to convert signals coming from the PREAMP. The con-
verter, designed in full differential switched-capacitor technique, is used for converting the various signals to the
digital domain. This principle offers the following advantages:
    •   High noise immunity because of the differential signal path and integrating behavior
    •   Independent from clock frequency drift and clock jitter
    • Fast conversion time owing to second order mode
Four selectable values for the zero point of the input voltage allow the conversion to adapt to the sensor’s offset
parameter. The conversion rate varies with the programmed update rate. The fastest conversion rate is
1 k samples/s; the response time is then 1 ms. Based on a best fit, the Integral Nonlinearity (INL) is < 4 LSB14Bit.

                                                                                                   ZSC31010 Datasheet
2.3.        Digital Signal Processor
A digital signal processor (DSP) is used for processing the converted bridge data as well as for performing
temperature correction and for computing the temperature value for output on the digital channel.
The DSP reads correction coefficients from the EEPROM and can correct for
     •  Bridge Offset
     •  Bridge Gain
     •  Variation of Bridge Offset over Temperature (Tco)
     •  Variation of Bridge Gain over Temperature (Tcg)
     •  A Single Second Order Effect (SOT - Second Order Term)
The EEPROM contains a single SOT that can be applied to correct one and only one of the following:
         nd
     •  2 order behavior of bridge measurement
         nd
     •  2 order behavior of Tco
         nd
     •  2 order behavior of Tcg
(For more details, see section 3.6.1.)
If the SOT applies to correcting the bridge reading, then the correction formula for the bridge reading is
represented as a two step process as follows:
         ZB = Gain _ B(1 + ∆T ∗ Tcg) ∗ (BR _ Raw + Offset _ B + ∆T ∗ Tco)                              (1)
         BR = ZB(1.25 + SOT ∗ ZB)                                                                      (2)    `
Where:
          BR           = Corrected Bridge reading that is fed as digital or analog output on Sig™ pin
          ZB           = Intermediate result in the calculations
          BR_Raw       = Raw Bridge reading from ADC
          T_Raw        = Raw Temperature reading converted from PTAT signal
          Gain_B       = Bridge gain term
          Offset_B     = Bridge offset term
          Tcg          = Temperature coefficient gain
          Tco          = Temperature coefficient offset
          ∆T           = (T_Raw - TSETL)
          T_Raw        = Raw Temperature reading converted from PTAT signal
          TSETL        = Raw PTAT reference value (See Technical Note—ZSC31010, ZSC31015, and ZSSC3015
                         Calibration Sequence, DLL, and EXE for details.)
          SOT          = Second Order Term
Note:       See section 3.6.2.7 for limitations when SOT applies to the bridge reading.

                                                                                                     ZSC31010 Datasheet
                                         nd
If the SOT applies to correcting the 2      order behavior of Tco, then the formula for bridge correction is as follows:
         BR = Gain _ B(1 + ∆T ∗ Tcg) ∗ [BR _ Raw + Offset _ B + ∆T(SOT ∗ ∆T + Tco)]                      (3)
Note: See section 3.6.2.7 for limitations when SOT applies to Tco.
                                         nd
If the SOT applies to correcting the 2      order behavior of Tcg, then the formula for bridge correction is as follows:
         BR = Gain _ B[1 + ∆T(SOT ∗ ∆T + Tcg)] ∗ [BR _ Raw + Offset _ B + ∆T ∗ Tco ]                     (4)
The bandgap reference gives a very linear PTAT signal, so temperature correction can always simply be
accomplished with a linear gain and offset term.
Corrected Temp Reading:
         T = Gain _ T(T _ Raw + Offset _ T)                                                              (5)
Where:
         T_Raw        = Raw Temperature reading converted from PTAT signal
         Offset_T     = Temperature sensor offset coefficient
         Gain_T       = Temperature gain coefficient
2.3.1.     EEPROM
The EEPROM contains the calibration coefficients for gain and offset, etc., and the configuration bits, such as
output mode, update rate, etc. When programming the EEPROM, an internal charge-pump voltage is used, so a
high voltage supply is not needed. The EEPROM is implemented as a shift register. During an EEPROM read, the
contents are shifted 8 bits before each transmission of one byte occurs.
The charge-pump is internally regulated to 12.5 V, and the programming time is typically 6 ms.
Note:    EEPROM writing can only be performed at temperatures lower than 85°C.
2.3.2.     One-Wire Interface—ZACwire™
The IC communicates via a One-Wire Serial Interface (OWI, ZACwire™). There are different commands available
for the following:
     •  Reading the conversion result of the ADC (Get_BR_Raw, Get_T_Raw)
     •  Calibration commands

2.4.       Output Stage
2.4.1.     Digital to Analog Converter (Output DAC)
An 11-bit DAC, based on sub-ranging resistor strings, is used for the digital-to-analog output conversion in the
analog ratiometric and absolute analog voltage modes. Selection during calibration configures the system to
operate in either of these modes. The design allows for excellent testability as well as low power consumption.
Figure 2.2 shows the data timing of the DAC output with the 1 kHz update rate setting.

2.4.2.     Output Buffer
A rail-to-rail operational amplifier (OpAmp) configured as a unity gain buffer can drive resistive loads (whether
pull-up or pull-down) as low as 2.5 kΩ and capacitances up to 15 nF. To limit the error due to amplifier offset
voltage, an error compensation circuit is included which tracks and reduces the offset voltage to < 1 mV.
2.4.3.     Voltage Reference Block
A linear regulator control circuit is included in the Voltage Reference Block to interface with an external JFET
to allow operation in systems where the supply voltage exceeds 5.5 V. This circuit can also be used for over-
voltage protection. The regulator set point has a coarse adjustment via an EEPROM bit (see section 2.3.1), which
can adjust the set point around 5.0 V or 5.5 V. In addition, the 1 V trim setting (see below) can also act as a fine
adjustment for the regulation set point.
Note: If using the external JFET for over-voltage protection purposes (i.e., 5 V at JFET drain and expecting 5 V
at JFET source), there will be a voltage drop across the JFET; therefore ratiometricity will be compromised
somewhat depending on the rds(on) of the chosen JFET. A Vishay J107 is the best choice, because it has only
an 8 mV drop worst case. If using as regulation instead of over-voltage, an MMBF4392 also works well.
The Voltage Reference Block uses the absolute reference voltage provided by the Bandgap to produce two
regulated on-chip voltage references. A 1 V reference is used for the output DAC high reference, when the part is
configured for 0 to 1 V analog output. For this reason, the 1 V reference must be very accurate and includes trim,
such that its value can be trimmed within +/-3 mV of 1.0 V. The 1 V reference is also used as the on-chip
reference for the JFET regulator block, so the regulation set point of the JFET regulator can be fine-tuned, using
the 1 V trim. The 5 V reference can be trimmed within +/-15 mV. Table 2.1 shows the order of trim codes with
0111B for the lowest reference voltage, and 1000B for the highest reference voltage.

2.5.       Clock Generator / Power-On Reset (CLKPOR)
If the power supply exceeds 2.5 V (maximum), the reset signal de-asserts, and the clock generator starts oper-
ating at a frequency of approximately 512 kHz (+17% / -22%). The exact value only influences the conversion
cycle time and the communication to the outside world, but not the accuracy of signal processing. In addition, to
minimize the oscillator error as the VDD voltage changes, an on-chip regulator is used to supply the oscillator
block.

2.5.1.    Trimming the Oscillator
Trimming is performed at wafer level, and it is strongly recommended that this is not to be changed during
calibration, because ZACwire™ communication is no longer guaranteed at different oscillator frequencies.

3          Functional Description
3.1.       General Working Mode
The command/data transfer takes place via the one-wire Sig™ pin, using the ZACwire™ serial communication
protocol. After power-on, the IC waits for 6 ms (i.e., the command window) for the Start_CM command. Without
this command, the Normal Operation Mode (NOM) starts. In this mode, raw bridge values are converted, and the
corrected values are presented on the output in analog or digital format (depending on the configuration stored in
EEPROM).
Command Mode (CM) can only be entered during the 6 ms command window after power-on. If the IC receives
the Start_CM command during the command window, it remains in the Command Mode. The CM allows changing
to one of the other modes via command. After command Start_RM, the IC is in the Raw Mode (RM). Without
correction, the raw values are transmitted to the digital output in a predefined order. The RM can only be stopped
by power-off. Raw Mode is used by the calibration software for collection of raw bridge and temperature data, so
the correction coefficients can be calculated.

The incoming serial signal will be sampled at a 512 kHz clock rate. This protocol is very tolerant to clock skew and
can easily tolerate baud rates in the 6 kHz to 48 kHz range.

3.2.4.     ZSC31010 Read Operations
The incoming frame will be checked for proper parity on both, command and data bytes, as well as for any edge
time-outs prior to a full frame being received.
Once a command/data pair is received, the ZSC31010 will perform that command. After the command has been
successfully executed by the IC, the IC will acknowledge success by a transmission of an A5H-byte back to the
master. If the master does not receive an A5H transmission within 130 ms of issuing the command, it must
assume the command was either improperly received or could not be executed.

The ZSC31010 transmits 10-bit bytes (1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 parity bit). During calibration and configuration,
transmissions are normally either A5H or data. A5H indicates successful completion of a command. There are two
different digital output modes configurable (digital output with temperature, and digital output with only bridge
data). During Normal Operation Mode, if the part is configured for digital output of the bridge reading, it first
transmits the high byte of bridge data, followed by the low byte. The bridge data is 14 bits in resolution, so the
upper two bits of the high byte are always zero-padded. There is a 32 μs stop time when the bus is held high
between bytes in a packet.

The second digital output mode is digital output bridge reading with temperature. It will be transmitted as a 3-data-
byte packet. The temperature byte represents an 8-bit temperature quantity, spanning from -50 to 150°C.

Table 3.2 shows the idle time between packets versus the update rate. This idle time can vary by nominal +/-15%
between parts, and over a temperature range of -50 to 150ºC.
Transmissions from the IC occur at one of two speeds depending on the update rate programmed in EEPROM. If
the user chooses one of the two fastest update rates (1 ms or 5 ms) then the baud rate of the digital transmission
will be 32 kHz (minimum 25 kHz). If, however, the user chooses one of the two slower update rates (25 ms or
125 ms), then the baud rate of the digital transmission will be 8 kHz (maximum 9.4 kHz).
The total transmission time for both digital output configurations is shown in Table 3.2.

The temperature raw reading is performed less often than a bridge reading, because the temperature changes
more slowly.
Table 3.3 shows the timing for the special measurements (temperature and bridge measurement) in the different
update rate modes.

It is easy to program any standard microcontroller to communicate with the ZSC31010. IDT can provide sample
code for a MicroChip® PIC microcontroller.
For update rates less than 1 kHz, the output is followed by a power-down, as shown below.

3.2.5.     High Level Protocol
The ZSC31010 will listen for a command/data pair to be transmitted for the 6 ms after the de-assertion of its
internal Power-On Reset (POR). If a transmission is not received within this time frame, then it will transition to
Normal Operation Mode (NOM). In NOM, it will output bridge data in 0 to 1 V analog, rail-to-rail ratiometric analog
output, or digital output, depending on how the part is currently configured.
If the ZSC31010 receives a Start CM command within the first 6 ms after the de-assertion of POR, then it will go
into Command Mode (CM). In this mode, calibration/configuration commands will be executed. The ZSC31010
will acknowledge successful execution of commands by transmission of an A5H. The calibrating/ configuring
master will know that a command was not successfully executed if no response is received after 130 ms of
issuing the command. Once in command interpreting/executing mode, the ZSC31010 will stay in this mode until
power is removed, or a Start NOM (Start Normal Operation Mode) command is received. The Start CM command
is used as an interlock mechanism, to prevent a spurious entry into command mode on power-up. The first
command received within the 6 ms window of POR must be a Start CM command to enter into command
interpreting mode. Any other commands will be ignored.
3.3.       Command/Data Bytes Encoding
The 16-bit command/data stream sent to the ZSC31010 can be broken into 2 bytes, shown in Table 3.4. The
most significant byte encodes the command byte. The least significant byte represents the data byte.

3.4.         Calibration Sequence
Although the ZSC31010 can function with many different types of resistive bridges, assume it is connected to a
pressure bridge for the following calibration example.
In this case, calibration essentially involves collecting raw bridge and temperature data from the ZSC31010 for
different known pressures and temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the calibration master (the
PC), and the calculated coefficients can then be written to the EEPROM of the ZSC31010.
IDT can provide software and hardware with samples to perform the calibration.
There are three main steps to calibration:
      1. Assigning a unique identification to the ZSC31010. This identification is programmed into the EEPROM
           and can be used as an index into the database stored on the calibration PC. This database will contain all
           the raw values of bridge readings and temperature reading for that part, as well as the known pressure
           and temperature the bridge was exposed to. This unique identification can be stored in a combination of
           the following EEPROM registers: TSETL, Tcg, Tco. These registers will be overwritten at the end of the
           calibration process, so this unique identification is not a permanent serial number.
      2. Data collection. Data collection involves getting raw data from the bridge at different known pressures and
           temperatures. This data is then stored on the calibration PC using the unique identification of the IC as
           the index to the database.
      3. Coefficient calculation and write. Once enough data points have been collected to calculate all the
           desired coefficients, then the coefficients can be calculated by the calibrating PC and written to the IC.

                                                                                                  ZSC31010 Datasheet
Step 1: Assigning Unique Identification
Assigning a unique identification number is as simple as using the commands Program TSETL, Program Tcg, and
Program Tco. These three 8-bit registers will allow for 16M unique devices. In addition, Gain_B must be
programmed to 800H (unity), and Gain_T must be programmed to 80H (unity).
Step 2: Data Collection
The number of different unique (pressure, temperature) points that calibration needs to be performed at depends
on the customer’s needs. The minimum is a 2-point calibration, and the maximum is a 5-point calibration. To
acquire raw data from the part, instruct the ZSC31010 to enter Raw Mode. This is done by issuing a Start_CM
(Start Command Mode, 5000H) command to the IC, followed by a Start_RM (Start Raw Mode, 4010H) command
with the LSB of the upper data nibble set. Now, if the Gain_B term was set to unity (800H) and the Gain_T term
was also set to unity (80H), then the part will be in Raw Mode and will be outputting raw data on its Sig™ pin,
instead of corrected bridge and temperature values. The calibration system should now collect several of these
data points (16 each of bridge and temperature is recommended) and average them. These raw bridge and
temperature measurements should be stored in the database, along with the known pressure and temperature.
The output format during Raw Mode is Bridge_High, Bridge_Low, Temp, each of these being 8-bit quantities. The
upper 2 bits of Bridge_High are zero-filled. The Temp data (8-bit only) would not really be enough data for accu-
rate temperature calibration. Therefore, the upper 3 bits of temperature information are not given, but rather
assumed known. Therefore, effectively 11 bits of temperature information are provided in this mode.
Step 3: Coefficient Calculations
The mathematical equations used to perform the coefficient calculation are quite complicated; therefore only a
basic overview is provided in section 3.6. IDT will, however, provide software to perform the coefficient calcu-
lation and the source code algorithms in a C-code format upon request. Once the coefficients are calculated, the
final step is to write them to the EEPROM of the ZSC31010.
The number of calibration points required can be as few as two or as many as five. This depends on the precision
desired, and the behavior of the resistive bridge in use.
    •   2-point calibration would be used to obtain only a gain and offset term for bridge compensation with no
        temperature compensation for either term.
                                                                            st
    •   3-point calibration would be used to also obtain the Tco term for 1 order temperature compensation of the
        bridge offset term.
                                                                                       nd
    •   3-point calibration could also be used to obtain the additional term SOT for 2 order correction for the
        bridge (SOT_BR), but no temperature compensation of the bridge output; see section 3.6.2.7 for limitations.
    •   4-point calibration would be used to also obtain both, the Tco term and the Tcg term, which provides
          st
        1 order temperature compensation of the bridge offset gain term.
    •   4-point calibration could also be used to obtain the Tco term and the SOT_BR term; see section 3.6.2.7 for
        limitations.
                                                                                               nd
    •   5-point calibration would be used to obtain Tco, Tcg, and an SOT term that provides 2 order correction
                                                        nd                        nd
        applied to one and only one of the following: 2 order Tco (SOT_Tco), 2 order Tcg (SOT_Tcg), or
          nd
        2 order bridge (SOT_BR); see section 3.6.2.7 for limitations.

3.6.2.     Interpretation of Binary Numbers for Correction Coefficients
BR_Raw should be interpreted as an unsigned number in the set [0, 16383] with a resolution of 1.
T_Raw should be interpreted as an unsigned number in the set [0, 16383], with a resolution of 4.
3.6.2.1. Gain_B Interpretation
Gain_B should be interpreted as a number in the set [0, 64]. The MSB (bit 14) is a scaling bit that will multiply the
effect of the remaining bits Gain_B[13:0] by 8. Bits Gain_B[13:0] represent a number in the range of [0, 8], with
Gain_B[13] having a weighting of 4, and each subsequent bit has a weighting of ½ the previous bit.

Examples:
    The binary number: 010010100110001B = 4.6489; Gain_B[14] is 0B, so the number represented by
    Gain_B[13:0] is not multiplied by 8.
    The binary number: 101100010010110B = 24.586; Gain_B[14] is 1B, so the number represented by
    Gain_B[13:0] is multiplied by 8.
Limitation: Using the 5-point calibration 5pt-Tcg&Tco&SOT_Tco (including the second order SOT_Tco), the
Gain_B is limited to a value equal or less than 8 (instead of 64).

3.6.2.5. Tco Interpretation

3.6.2.7. SOT Interpretation
             nd
SOT is a 2 order term that can apply to one and only one of the following: bridge non-linearity correction, Tco
non-linearity correction, or Tcg non-linearity correction.
As it applies to bridge non-linearity correction:
     Resolution: 0.25% @ Full Scale
  nd
2 order correction SOT_BR is possible up to +5%/-6.2% full scale difference from the ideal fit (straight line),
because the SOT coefficient values are limited to the range of (0xC0 = -0.25dec) to (0x7F = 0.4960938dec).
(Saturation in internal arithmetic will occur at greater negative non-linearities.)
Limitation: Using any calibration method for which SOT is applied to the bridge measurement (SOT_BR), there
is a possibility of calibration math overflow. This only occurs if the sensor input exceeds 200% of the calibrated full
span, which means the highest applied sensor input should never go higher than this value.
Example: This example of the limitation when SOT is applied to the bridge reading uses a pressure sensor bridge
that outputs -10 mV at the lowest pressure of interest. That point is calibrated to read 0%. The same sensor
outputs +40 mV at the highest pressure of interest. That point is calibrated to read 100%. This sensor has a
50 mV span over the pressure range of interest. If the sensor were to experience an over-pressure event that took
the sensor output up to 90 mV (200% of span), the internal calculations could overflow. The result would be a
corrected bridge reading that would not be saturated at 100% as expected, but instead read a value lower than
100%. This problem only occurs when SOT is applied to correct the bridge reading.
As SOT applies to Tcg:
                              o  2
     Resolution: 0.3 ppm/( C)
                               o  2
     Range:        ±38 ppm/( C)
As it applies to Tco:
Two settings are possible. It is possible to scale the effect of SOT by 8. If Tc_cfg[1] is set, then both, Tco and
SOT’s contribution to Tco, are multiplied by 8.

Limitation: If the second order term SOT applies to Tco, the bridge gain Gain_B is limited to values equal or less
than 8 (instead of 64).

4           Application Circuit Examples
Note: The typical output analog load resistor RL = 10 kΩ (minimum 2.5 kΩ). This optional load resistor can be
configured as a pull-up or pull-down. If it is configured as a pull-down, it cannot be part of the module to be
calibrated because this would prevent proper operation of the ZACwire™. If a pull-down load is desired, it must be
added to the system after module calibration.
There is no output load capacitance needed.

4.4.        Digital Output
For all three circuits, the output signal can also be digital. Depending on the output select bits, the bridge signal,
or the bridge signal and temperature signal are sent.
For the digital output, no load resistor, or load capacity are necessary. No pull-down resistor is allowed. If a line
resistor or pull-up resistor is used, the requirement for the rise time must be met (≤ 5 µs). The IC output includes a
pull-up resistor of about 30 kΩ. The digital output can easily be read by firmware from a microcontroller, and IDT
can provide the customer with software in developing the interface.
4.5.        Output Short Protection
The output of the ZSC31010 has no short protection. Therefore, a resistor RSP in series with the output must be
                                                                                                †
added in the application module. Refer to Table 4.1 to determine the value of RSP .
To minimize additional error caused by this resistor for the analog output voltage, the load impedance must meet
the following requirement:
          RL >> RSP
