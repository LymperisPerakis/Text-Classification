NCV1124
Dual Variable−Reluctance
Sensor Interface IC
   The NCV1124 is a monolithic integrated circuit designed primarily
to condition signals from sensors used to monitor rotating parts.
   The NCV1124 is a dual channel device. Each of the two identical
channels interfaces with a variable−reluctance sensor, and
continuously compares the sensor output signal to a                                       http://onsemi.com
user−programmable internal reference. An alternating input signal of
appropriate amplitude at IN1 or IN2 will result in a rectangular
waveform at the corresponding OUT terminal, suitable for interface to                            8
either standard microprocessors or standard logic families.                                             1
   A diagnostic input, common to both channels, provides a means to
test for degradation or loss of the physical connector to both sensors.                            SO−8

low side clamps become active (Figure 4). Increasing the
amplitude further (Figure 5), the high−side clamp becomes
active. These internal clamps allow for voltages up to −250 V
and 250 V on the sensor side of the setup (with R1 = R2 =
22 k) (reference the diagram page 1).
  Figure 6 shows the effect using the diagnostic (DIAG)
function has on the circuit. The input threshold (negative) is
switched from a threshold of −160 mV to +160 mV when
DIAG goes from a low to a high. There is no hysteresis when
DIAG is high.

2. Determine RAdj
   Set RAdj as close to R1 + RRS as possible.                        But, VRS = 0 during this test, so it drops out.
   Therefore, RAdj = 17 k.                                           Using the following as worst case Low and High:

4. Calculate worst case VRS(+TRP)
   Examination of equation (7) and the spec reveals the worst
case trip voltage will occur when:                                              135 mV ) 23.6 mA        16.15 k

   INAdj = 16 mA                                                              + 16.5 k
   INP1 = 15 mA
   R1 = 14.25 k (5% low)                                             Therefore,
   RAdj = 17.85 k (5% High)                                              RRS(MIN) + 16.5 k (meets 12 k system spec)

                                                                    RRS(MAX) +                                      * 14.25 k
                                                                                                 6.0mA
which is still less than the 250 mV minimum amplitude of                         + 48.4 k
