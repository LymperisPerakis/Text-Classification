  The INTERRUPT register reflects current state of various fault conditions. The IRQ/OC output asserts when any of the
  bits in the INTERRUPT register is set. INTERRUPT register bits are latched and are not cleared when the initiating
  condition is removed. Reading the INTERRUPT register clears all the bits and deasserts IRQ/OC. IRQ/OC reasserts
  only when another fault condition occurs.

           7             ThShutInt           this bit is not cleared until the register is read. The current status of the thermal

                                        0: The MAX14827A is not in thermal shutdown.
                                        Wake-Up Event Interrupt
                                        1: This bit is set when an IO-Link wake-up condition is detected on the C/Q line.

                                        0: No wake-up condition is detected.
                                        The wake-up interrupt can be disabled by setting the WuDis bit to 1.

                                   0: No fault on the C/Q driver.
                                   V24 Low Voltage Warning Interrupt
                                   1: This bit is set when V24 falls below the IO-Link low-voltage warning threshold fault
        3                V24WInt       (V24 < V24W). Once set, this bit is not cleared until the register is read. The current
                                       status of the thermal shutdown condition can be read in the Status register.
                                   0: V24 is greater than the low-voltage warning threshold.
                                   V24 Supply Undervoltage Interrupt
                                   1: This bit is set when V24 falls below the UVLO threshold (V24 < V24UVLO). Once set,

SPI Burst Access
Burst access allows writing or reading in one block, by
only defining the initial register address in the SPI com-
mand byte. Once the initial SPI address is received, the                           V24
MAX14827A automatically increments the register after
each SPI data byte. Efficient programming of multiple
consecutive registers is thus possible. Chip select, CS/
PP, must be kept low during the whole write/read cycle.
The SPI clock continues clocking throughout the burst
access cycle. The burst cycle ends when the SPI master
pulls CS/PP high.                                                      MAX14827A DO
