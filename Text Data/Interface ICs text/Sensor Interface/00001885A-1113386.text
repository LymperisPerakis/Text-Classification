 Note 1    A pull-up to VDD is required on the MCLR# pin. Use a 10K ohm pull-up resistor.
 Note 2    A low-ESR (1 Ohm) capacitor is required on the VCAP pin, which is used to stabilize the internal voltage
           regulator output. The VCAP pin must not be connected to VDD, and must have a CEFC capacitor, with at
           least a 6V rating, connected to ground. The type can be ceramic or tantalum.

3.0       GUIDELINES FOR GETTING STARTED
3.1       Basic Connection Requirements
Getting started with the SSC7150 requires attention to a minimal set of device pin connections before proceeding with
development. The following is a list of pin names, which must always be connected:
• All VDD and VSS pins (see Section 3.2 “Decoupling Capacitors”)
• All AVDD and AVSS pins, even if the ADC module is not used (see Section 3.2 “Decoupling Capacitors”). Note
  that there is no ADC support in this device. See Note below.
• VCAP pin (see Section 3.3 “Capacitor on Internal Voltage Regulator (Vcap)”)
• MCLR# pin (see Section 3.4 “Master Clear (MCLR#) Pin”)
  Note:      The AVDD and AVSS pins must be connected, regardless of ADC use and the ADC voltage reference
             source.
Refer to the following schematic for connection information:
     SSC7150 Sensor Hub Module, Assy. 6753, Schematic Revision 1.4.
3.2       Decoupling Capacitors
The use of decoupling capacitors on power supply pins, such as VDD, VSS, AVDD and AVSS is required. See Figure 3-1.
Consider the following criteria when using decoupling capacitors:
• Value and type of capacitor: A value of 0.1 µF (100 nF), 10-20V is recommended. The capacitor should be a low
  Equivalent Series Resistance (low-ESR) capacitor and have resonance frequency in the range of 20 MHz and
  higher. It is further recommended that ceramic capacitors be used.
• Placement on the printed circuit board: The decoupling capacitors should be placed as close to the pins as
  possible. It is recommended that the capacitors be placed on the same side of the board as the device. If space is
  constricted, the capacitor can be placed on another layer on the PCB using a via; however, ensure that the trace
  length from the pin to the capacitor is within one-quarter inch (6 mm) in length.
• Handling high frequency noise: If the board is experiencing high frequency noise, upward of tens of MHz, add a
  second ceramic-type capacitor in parallel to the above described decoupling capacitor. The value of the second
  capacitor can be in the range of 0.01 µF to 0.001 µF. Place this second capacitor next to the primary decoupling
  capacitor. In high-speed circuit designs, consider implementing a decade pair of capacitances as close to the
  power and ground pins as possible. For example, 0.1 µF in parallel with 0.001 µF.
• Maximizing performance: On the board layout from the power supply circuit, run the power and return traces to
  the decoupling capacitors first, and then to the device pins. This ensures that the decoupling capacitors are first in
  the power chain. Equally important is to keep the trace length between the capacitor and the power pins to a min-
  imum thereby reducing PCB track inductance.

3.2.1             BULK CAPACITORS
The use of a bulk capacitor is recommended to improve power supply stability. Typical values range from 4.7 µF to
47 µF. This capacitor should be located as close to the device as possible.
3.3            Capacitor on Internal Voltage Regulator (VCAP)
3.3.1             INTERNAL REGULATOR MODE
A low-ESR (1 Ohm) capacitor is required on the VCAP pin, which is used to stabilize the internal voltage regulator output.
The VCAP pin must not be connected to VDD, and must have a CEFC capacitor, with at least a 6V rating, connected to
ground. The type can be ceramic or tantalum. Refer to Section 4.0 “Electrical Characteristics” for additional informa-
tion on CEFC specifications.

 Note 1:   A device’s supply current is mainly a function of the operating voltage and frequency, as well as tempera-
           ture.
      2:   The current measurements are as follows:
            • Peak current (IPEAK):
               This is the peak active current value when a sensor is actively providing environmental changes.
            • Active current (IACTIVE):
               This is the average operating current value when a sensor is actively providing environmental changes.
            • Idle current (IIDLE):
               This is the average idle current value when no sensor is actively providing environmental changes (and the device is
                    not in power-down mode).
            • Power-Down current (IPD):
               This is the current value when the device is in power-down mode. This is the state entered when the Host issues the
                    SET_POWER (Sleep) Command.
               Wakeup from power-down mode requires the I2C2_WAKE pin.
      3:   Data in “Typical” column is at 3.3V, 25°C at specified operating frequency unless otherwise stated. Param-
           eters are for design guidance only and are not tested.

            and are not tested.
       2:   The leakage current on the MCLR# pin is strongly dependent on the applied voltage level. The specified
            levels represent normal operating conditions. Higher leakage current may be measured at different input
            voltages.
       3:   Negative current is defined as current sourced by the pin.
       4:   This parameter is characterized, but not tested in manufacturing.
       5:   See the “Pin List” section for the 5V-tolerant pins.
       6:   The VIH specifications are only in relation to externally applied inputs, and not with respect to the user-
            selectable internal pull-ups. External open drain input signals utilizing the internal pull-ups of the device are
            provided to be recognized only as a logic “high” internally to the device. For External “input” logic inputs
            that require a pull-up source, to ensure the minimum VIH of those components, it is recommended to use
            an external pull-up resistor rather than the internal pull-ups of the device.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR
    OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. Microchip disclaims all liability arising from this information and its use. Use of Micro-
