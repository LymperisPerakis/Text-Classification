Brief Description                                              Benefits
The ZIOL2401 is a line driver/level shifter IC that            • Configurable feature set
provides two independent HV* I/O channels with a               • Nonvolatile storage of system configuration
wide range of configurable system features. It                 • Excellent electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
addresses the physical layer of sensor/actuator                  performance due to adjustable output slew rate
systems in factory automation applications and is                control
specifically designed to support the communication
                         †                                     • Low RDSon of 3.3Ω in tandem mode

operational temperatures.                                      • EEPROM read/write functionality within full
                                                                 operating temperature range
The configuration is stored in an on-chip EEPROM
                                                               • Space saving 4x4mm² 24-pin QFN
and automatically loaded into the ZIOL2401’s control
register during power up. The ZIOL2401 also
provides status information, such as overload and              Available Support
