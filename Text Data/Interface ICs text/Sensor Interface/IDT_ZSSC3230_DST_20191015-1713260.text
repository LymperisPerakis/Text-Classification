6.        Device Description
The ZSSC3230 can be set up for one of three main operating modes:
 Sleep Mode – Sleep Mode based operation is recommended for smart sensors for the lowest average power consumption. The
    ZSSC3230 automatically enters an idle state after command execution for minimum current consumption; however, the interface is still
    listening and accepts commands. After receiving of a valid command, the ZSSC3230 wakes up, executes the command, and provides the
    results at the digital interface and then returns to Sleep State.
 Command Mode – Command Mode is most appropriate for evaluation, test, and calibration purposes. In this mode, all commands are
    available, both digital and analog outputs are supported, and no restrictions for any functionality need to be considered. Command Mode
    can be used for applications requiring re-occurring (or even continuous) digital interaction and minimum latency. Applications in
    Command Mode are only active on command request. See Table 15 for definitions of the commands.
 Cyclic Measurement Mode – Cyclic operation means autonomous, cyclically repeated sensor measurements and related digital and
    output updates.
After power-on, the voltage regulators are switched on, and the ZSSC3230’s low-voltage section (LV) is active while the related interface
configuration information is read from memory. Then the LV section is switched off, the ZSSC3230 goes into Sleep Mode, and the interface is
ready to receive commands. The interface is always powered by VDD, so it is referred to as the high voltage section (HV).
Figure 5 shows the ZSSC3230 main operation modes: Normal Mode (which uses two operation principles: “Sleep” and “Cyclic”) and Command
Mode. The Normal Mode automatically returns to Sleep Mode after executing the requested measurements, or periodically wakes up and
conducts another measurement according to the setting for the sleep duration configured by the CYC_period (bits[14:12] in memory register
02HEX; see Table 16). In Command Mode, the ZSSC3230 remains active if a dedicated command (e.g., Start_NOM) is sent, which is helpful
during calibration. Command Mode can only be entered if a Start_CM (command A9HEX; see Table 15) is the first command received after a
POR.

6.1        Signal Flow
See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for the ZSSC3230 block diagram sensors input options. The CC pin is duplicated as CC’ depending on the preferred
physical sensor connection. Selecting CC or CC’ can be done using the signal setup CC_pin_selection bits[1:0] in memory register 19HEX (see
Table 16).
Two sensor connections are possible:
 Differential Measurement Mode, which is an isolated C mode with CMEAS connected between CC and C0 or CC’ and C0 so that both ends
    of the capacitor are connected to the ZSSC3230.
 Single-Ended Measurement Mode, which is a grounded C mode with CMEAS connected between CC and VSS or CC’ and VSS/ground. In
    this mode, C0 is switched to VSS. In this mode, only one capacitor input pin needs to be directly connected to the ZSSC3230.
The capacitance amplifier (CapAmp), which is also referred to as the charge-voltage converter (CVC), measures an external capacitance value,
CMEAS and provides a differential output voltage proportional to the capacitance (change) to the subsequent ADC. Thereby CMEAS is connected
with both ends to the IC or with one pin to VSS.
The bias current for the stage (CapAmp) can be programmed (using the setup signal noise_mode bit 8 in the Sensor_config memory register
12HEX; see Table 16) to allow a trade-off between current consumption and achievable signal to noise ratio (SNR).
The system control unit controls the analog circuitry to perform the measurement types for the external capacitive sensor and internal
temperature. The multiplexer selects the signal input to the amplifier, which can be the voltage-converted signals of the external capacitive
sensor or the internal temperature reference sensor signal. A full measurement request will trigger an automatic sequence of all measurement
types and all input signals.
The gain amplifier (PGA) adjusts the respective signal from the capacitance-to-voltage converter or internal temperature sensor. The ZSSC3230
employs a programmable analog-to-digital converter (ADC) optimized for conversion speed and noise suppression. The programmable
resolution from 12 to 18 bits provides flexibility for adapting the conversion characteristics.
The math core accomplishes the auto-zero, span, and 1st and 2nd order temperature compensation of the measured external sensor signal. The
correction coefficients are stored in the nonvolatile memory. The ZSSC3230 supports I2C interface communication for controlling the
ZSSC3230, configuration, and measurement result output. An adequate PDM signal for the compensated sensor signal can be provided in
Cyclic Measurement Mode at the PDM pin.
Table 5 lists the conversion time of a full corrected and compensated measurement. The temperature measurement always has a 14-bit
resolution. The conversion time for the sensor channels includes a full ADC conversion plus auto-zero measurement and the corresponding
CVC conversion time for this channel and the respective temperature measurement and math calculation. The 2 noise modes (bit[8] in memory
register 12HEX) are listed separately.

6.2       Capacitive Sensor Front-End
The capacitance amplifier input range (CRANGE) must be adjusted to the external capacitance conditions for signal (CSIGNAL) and offset shift
(COFFSET) as given in Equation 1. See Figure 6 for an illustration of the terms.
       CRANGE = COFFSET + CSIGNAL                                                                                                 Equation 1
COFFSET operates as a zero-shift capacitance to cancel a given offset by the sensor. The offset-shift capacitance must not exceed the selected
input capacitance range CRANGE. For COFFSET, the respective configuration must be set up in the EEPROM for the shift_cap parameter (bits[5:0]
in memory register 12HEX; see Table 16).
The correlating setup for CSIGNAL must be done in the EEPROM for parameter cap_range (bits[13:9] in memory register 12HEX). In Table 16, the
respective values are given. These values can be measured in the positive and negative direction, so the effective range of CSIGNAL will be
doubled compared to the cap_range setting. The principle is shown in Figure 6.

6.2.1 Differential Mode
The most relevant measurement mode is the Differential Measurement Mode, with CMEAS connected between CC and C0 or CC’ and C0 so that
both ends of the capacitor are connected to the ZSSC3230. For electrical connections, see Figure 7.
For the ZSSC3230 for the Differential Measurement Mode, the configuration must be done in the EEPROM for parameter sensecap_type
(bit[15] in memory register 12HEX; see Table 16). When the sensecap_type is 0, the differential mode is selected, which is the default
configuration.

6.2.2 Single-Ended Mode
Another measurement mode is the single ended measurement mode, with CMEAS connected between CC and VSS or CC’ and VSS/ground. In
this mode C0 is switched to VSS. In this mode only 1 Pin needs to be directly connected to the IC.
Configuring the ZSSC3230 for Single-Ended Input Mode must be done in the EEPROM via the parameter sensecap_type (bit[15] in memory
register 12HEX; see Table 16). Since the respective bit is defined as “0” in the default configuration for Differential Mode, the bit must be
programmed to “1.”
6.2.3 Sensor Leakage Compensation
Sensor leakage compensation is an additional option for Single-Ended Mode to enable the sensor element’s leakage current compensation.
The leakage current is caused by the sensor element’s parasitic resistance. Enabling this function via the sensor_leakage bit[14] in memory
register 12HEX leads to loss of dynamic range and a decrease in the SNR. With losing 1-bit effective resolution on leakage compensation, the
respective capacitive input range for CSIGNAL will be doubled compared to the description in section 6.2.

6.2.4 Shield Driver Mode
The Shield Driver Mode is a special sub-mode for Single-Ended Mode. In this mode, the C0 pin will be forced to the same level as the CC/CC’
pin. This pin can be used to drive a shield, so the shield parasitic capacitance does not have an effect on the measurement. The Shield Driver
Mode can be enabled by setting the EEPROM parameter En_shlddrv (bit[4] in memory register 19HEX) to “1” (see Table 16).

6.2.5 Subtraction Mode
The Subtraction Mode is a special sub-mode for Single-Ended Mode. It is activated by setting the En_sh2 bit to “1” (bit[3] in memory register
19HEX; see Table 16). In this mode, C0 is charged to the opposite reference of the CC/CC’ node level. In conversion phase the charge of CC/CC’
and C0 are integrated. In this mode, the integrated capacitance corresponds to “Cx-Cy”; thus this mode can provide an additional range
extension.

6.3        Temperature Sensor
The ZSSC3230 provides a PTAT-based internal temperature sensor measurement to allow compensation for temperature effects. The
temperature output signal is a differential voltage that is adapted by the amplifier (PGA) for the ADC input. For IC-internal temperature
measurements, the respective settings are defined and programmed in the NVM by IDT. The resolution setting for temperature measurements
is defined as 14-bit.
6.4        Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to digitize the amplifier signal. To allow optimizing the trade-off between conversion time and
resolution, the resolution can be programmed from 12-bit to 18-bit by configuring the parameter adc_bits, (bits [7:6] in memory register 12HEX;
see Table 16). The ADC processes differential input signals provided by the internal amplifier for sensor measurement and temperature
measurement. The application default setting is 16-bit. The corresponding conversion times are listed in Table 6. The conversion time for the
sensor channels includes a full ADC conversion as well as the corresponding CVC conversion time for this channel. There are 2 noise modes
(selected with bit[8] in memory register 12HEX). The listed conversion times are valid for raw measurements including auto-zero compensation.

6.5 Calibration Math
The data path internally calculates with a 26-bit two’s-complement integer representation. The coefficients in the memory are stored as integers
in sign-magnitude representation (1-bit sign + 23-bit magnitude). Each multiplication scales the product by 223. There is an option to preprocess
the data by applying a 1/C algorithm. 1/C is typically used to pre-process transfer characteristics for capacitive pressure sensors. A principle
flow is shown in Figure 11.
Internal overflows and underflows are detected and the result is automatically saturated. The saturation is reported in the status byte.

6.5.1 1/C Pre-compensation
For capacitive pressure sensors, a pre-compensation of the ADC signal might be beneficial. Using this function will help to fit the typical pressure
sensor transfer characteristic to matching the second-order compensation input requirements for more accurate compensation results. If the
1/C pre-compensation is activated, it will apply only in Normal Measurement Mode with math compensation, not in RAW measurements using
Command Mode. The respective 1/C calculation for determination of calibration coefficients is handled in the respective calibration.dll. This
feature can be enabled by setting the corresponding bit siginv (bit[11] in memory register 02HEX; see Table 16). Before the 1/C math is applied,
the ADC value of the respective sensor input signal will be inverted.
This leads to the following transfer function for S_raw with the system transfer function that is shown in Figure 12.

Note: For the application, if a “Crange/CSens” inversion will be performed, the shift capacitor must to be set to “0.”

6.5.2 Sensor Signal Compensation Math
The SOT_curve (bit [15] in EEPROM word 02HEX; see Table 16) selects whether second-order equations compensate for sensor nonlinearity
with a parabolic or S-shaped curve. The parabolic compensation is recommended.
Equations for the Parabolic SOT_curve Setting (SOT_curve = 0):
The coefficients from the memory (23-bit absolute and 1-bit sign; see Table 7) are read into 26-bit-wide registers in the calculation block. The
24-bit-memory coefficients are shifted by two bits so that the MSB of the 24-bit memory coefficient is placed at the MSB of the 26-bit calculation
register coefficient.

6.6        Output Stages
The ZSSC3230 supports signal output via a PDM output pin and I2C output. Measured values are provided at an I2C output interface and at a
pulse-density modulation (PDM) output. The digital interface can be used for configuration and the calibration procedure using the user’s
computer in order to program a set of calibration coefficients into the on-chip memory.
6.6.1 PDM Output Stage
To use the ZSSC3230 in PDM Output Mode, the Cyclic Measurement Mode is required. The ZSSC3230 will not go into Sleep Mode or power-
down between measurements. The PDM Output Mode can be enabled via the PDM_enable bit (bit[9] in memory register 02HEX; see Table 16).
In this case, the PDM output will be started after power-on reset.
Note: If the ZSSC3230 is not used in PDM Output Mode, the PDM pin should not be connected.
The ZSSC3230 provides a pseudo-analog output of a sigma-delta modulator, i.e. a pulse-density stream, which can be converted into an analog
DAC-like output by external low-pass filtering. The PDM signal will be output selectively at the PDM pin. The PDM output is available for the
compensated sensor signal. The PDM output is scaled to a 16-bit wide output signal.
When the PDM output is used, an external capacitor must be connected to the PDM output as shown in Figure 13.

6.6.2 I2C Output
The ZSSC3230 supports an I2C slave interface for digital output operation. The implementation of the interfaces is such that the available
commands (see section 6.7.2) and request codes for the ZSSC3230 are the same regardless on the interface type used.
Initially after power-up or reset, the I2C slave address is loaded from the on-chip NVM from the Slave_Addr bits [6:0] in register 02HEX; see
Table 16). There is a general status byte, which is part of the ZSSC3230’s digital response on READ requests. Every response starts with a
status byte followed by the data word. The data word depends on the previous command. It is possible to read the same data more than once
if the read request is repeated. The next command invalidates any previous data.

 Bit 7 is intentionally not assigned in order to allow for a 1 bit-length time.
 Bit 6 indicates power: 1 if device is powered, 0 if not powered.
 Bit 5 indicates whether the ZSSC3230 is busy. The data for the last command is not available yet. No new commands are processed if
     the device is busy. It is “1” if the device is busy.

 Bit 3 and 4 indicate the actual mode of the ZSSC3230: 00 = Normal Operation Mode; 01 = Command Mode; 10 = Test Mode. See Table
    10.
 Bit 2 shows whether there has been a memory integrity/error as indicated by whether the checksum-based integrity check passed or
    failed: 0 if the integrity test passed; 1 if the test failed.
 Bit 1 shows whether there has been an ADC overflow, which is detected if the raw ADC-output value for capacitive measurement
    exceeded the nominal, digital ADC-output range, depending on the selected ADC resolution. This check is only for the raw results for the
    capacitive measurement.
 Bit 0 shows the status Information regarding ALU saturation. If the last executed command was a measurement request, this bit is 0 if any
    intermediate value and the final SSC result are in a valid range and no SSC-calculation internal saturation occurred. If the last command
    was a measurement request, this bit is 1 if an SSC-calculation internal saturation occurred. This bit is also 0 for any non-measurement
    command.

The I2C interface is compliant with the NXP I2C Bus Specification, Rev. 06 (UM10204, 4 April 2014). All modes up to High Speed Mode are
supported. Slave address codes 04HEX to 07HEX must not be programmed to the ZSSC3230 since they are exclusively used for the High Speed
Mode. The ZSSC3230 will support 7 bit addressing only.
In I2C Mode, each command is started as shown in Figure 14. Only the number of bytes that are needed for the command must be sent. An
exception is the I2C High Speed Mode where 3 bytes must always be sent. After the execution of a command (busy = 0), the expected data
can be read as illustrated in Figure 15 or if no data are returned by the command, the next command can be sent. The status can be read at
any time as described in Figure 16.

6.6.3 EOC and Output Interrupt Signaling
The EOC pin can be programmed to operate either as a “measurement busy” indicator and end-of-conversion (EOC) transducer, or as a
configurable interrupt transducer. The respective basic operation must be programmed into INT_setup bits in the memory (bits[8:7] in NVM
register 02HEX; see Table 16). One or two 24-bit-quantized thresholds can be programmed (see the Interrupt Level Setup memory registers:
13HEX, 14HEX and 15HEX). Depending on the INT_setup selection, the EOC pin provides a logic 1 or logic 0 according to the SSC-corrected
measurement result. The respective thresholds are programmed left-aligned in the memory, such that they must be programmed with the
threshold’s MSB in the memory register’s MSB, etc. The LSBs of the 24-bit threshold in the memory must be ignored according to the number
of bits of the selected ADC resolution (according to adc_bits).
If only the effective end-of-conversion is signalized (INT_setup = 00BIN), the EOC signal is pulse of approximately 5µs. The next command will
be executed only after this EOC-signaling period.
The interrupt functionality is only available for digital values from the SSC-calculation unit. The interrupt feature cannot monitor any type of raw
values. The encoding and data format of the interrupt thresholds is the same as for SSC-corrected measurement results (see Table 12).

6.7       Measurement and Output Options
Sensor measurement results of the ZSSC3230 are provided in digital at the I2C interface. This will be the main active interaction path, and it
can combined with the PDM output configuration.
6.7.1 Single Measurements: Digital Raw and SSC Results
The ZSSC3230 generates digital raw values, which are processed by the IC-internal math-core generating the SSC-corrected (linearized,
temperature-compensated) output signal; see section 6.5.2 for details about SSC math, etc. In addition to the SSC-corrected digital
measurement results, the ZSSC3230 can provide raw values with or without SSC correction for evaluation and/or calibration purposes. The
respective results are provided at the digital interface as a 24-bit-wide data word. Raw values are LSB-aligned. SSC results are MSB-aligned.

              Bit-Number:          23            22         21          20      …        2          1         0
    Meaning, Weighting:            20           2-1         2-2         2-3     …       2-21       2-22      2-23
The ZSSC3230 can process and digitize the following signals:
 Direct sensor signal inputs; i.e. perform sensor measurements, SM
 Auto-zero signals for the sensor channel, referred to as AZS
 Direct temperature signal inputs; i.e. perform temperature measurements, TM
 Auto-zero signals for the temperature channel, referred to as AZT
The utilization of auto-zero measurements allows inherent compensation for long-term drift effects of the ZSSC3230, such that the risk of lifetime
signal degradation for the application and smart sensor is minimized. For the auto-zero measurement, the sensor signal remains the input for
the auto-zero measurement with the gain and ADC setups the same as for the original signal measurement, but with swapped inputs and offset
configurations of the PGA and ADC such that the following holds for the resulting raw value:
 Sensor raw value with auto-zero: S_raw = 0.5  (SM – AZS)
 Temperature raw value with auto-zero:            T_raw = 0.5  (TM – AZT)
Enabling auto-zero measurements is strongly recommended.
The NVM configuration and measurement request commands can be used to select which effective measurements are conducted, processed,
and provided at the digital interface. The possible options for a single measurement request and output are the following:
 SSC-corrected sensor readings (requested by the “Measure” command AAHEX) generating an output of SSC-corrected, 24-bit sensor data
    followed by SSC-corrected, 24-bit temperature data.
 Raw sensor measurement with auto-zero correction (requested by the “Raw Sensor Measure” command A2HEX) generating an output of
    raw, 24-bit sensor data.
 Raw temperature measurement with auto-zero correction (requested by the “Raw Temperature Measure” command A6HEX) generating an
    output of raw, 24-bit temperature data.

6.7.3 Nonvolatile Memory (NVM)
In the ZSSC3230, the memory is organized in 16-bit wide registers and can be programmed multiple times (approximately 10000). There are
28 x 16-bit registers available for customer use. Each register can be re-programmed. Basically, there are two NVM content sectors:
 Customer Use – Accessible by means of regular WRITE operations: 20HEX to 3CHEX. It contains the customer ID, interface setup data,
      measurement setup information, calibration coefficients, etc.
 IDT Use – Only accessible for WRITE operations by IDT. This sector contains specific trim information and is programmed during
      manufacturing test by IDT; e.g., configurations for the internal temperature sensor are stored there.
*   Use oversample measurements to obtain noise-minimized measurement results in Sleep or Command Mode. With higher oversampling factors, the command
    execution time increases proportionally.

The NVM-consistency checksum is calculated (IC-internally for the whole NVM) using the polynomial: x16 + x15 + x2 + 1. The checksum
verification is only realized directly after VDD power-on. If the checksum is successfully verified, then the “Memory Error” status bit is set to 0BIN.
