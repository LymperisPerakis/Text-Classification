General Description                                          Benefits and Features
The MAX31910 industrial interface serializer translates,     ●● Ultra-Low Power and Heat Dissipation
conditions, and serializes the 24V digital output of sensors    • Low Quiescent Current (1.4mA typ)
and switches used in industrial, process, and building          • Highly Accurate and Stable Input Current Limiters,
automation to 5V CMOS-compatible signals required                  Adjustable from 0.5mA to 6mA
by microcontrollers. It provides the front-end interface        • Special (Patent-Pending) Ultra-Low-Power Mode
circuit of a programmable logic controller (PLC) digital           with Switched Current Limiters
input module.                                                ●● High Integration Reduces BOM Count, Board
The device features integrated current limiting, lowpass        Size, and System Cost
filtering, and channel serialization. Input current limit-      • 8 High-Voltage Input Channels (36V max)
ing allows a significant reduction in power consumed            • On-Chip 8-1 Serialization with SPI Interface
from the field voltage supply as compared to traditional        • On-Chip 5V Regulator
discrete resistor-divider implementations. In addition, to      • On-Chip Overtemperature Indicator
achieve the lowest in-class power dissipation, the device       • On-Chip Field Supply Voltage Monitor
uses patent-pending circuit techniques to achieve further       • Integrated Debounce Filters, Selectable from 0 to 3ms
reduction of power beyond what is possible by input          ●● Robust Features and Performance for Industrial
current limiting alone.                                         Environments
Selectable on-chip lowpass filters allow flexible debouncing    • Multibit CRC Code Generation and Transmission for
and filtering of sensor outputs based on the application.          Error Detection and More Reliable Data Transmission
On-chip serialization allows a drastic reduction in the         • High ESD Immunity on All Field Input Pins
number of optocouplers used for isolation. The device        ●● Accepts Industry Standard Input Types
serializer is stackable so that any number of input channels    • Configurable for IEC 61131-2 Input Types 1, 2, and 3
can be serialized and output through only one SPI-           ●● Flexible Power Supply Capability Enables Usage
compatible port. This reduces the number of optocouplers        in 5V, 12V, 24V, and Higher Voltage Systems
needed to only three, regardless of the number of input         • Wide Operating Field Supply Range of 7V to 36V
channels.                                                       • Can Be Powered From the Logic-Side Using a 5V
For enhanced robustness with respect to high-frequency             Supply
noise and fast electrical transients, a multibit CRC code
is generated and transmitted through the SPI port for
                                                             Applications
each 8 bits of data. The on-chip 5V voltage regulator can    ●● Digital Input Modules for PLCs
be used to power external optocouplers, digital isolators,   ●● Industrial, Building, and Process Automation
or other external 5V circuitry.                              ●● Motor Control
For low-cost applications, Maxim Integrated offers a
pin-compatible version of this device, the MAX31911.
The MAX31911 does not include the patent-pending
current clamp-switching circuitry that is included with the
MAX31910.
The MAX31912 and MAX31913 versions includes energy-
less LED drivers while maintaining pin compatibility.

Note 2: Limits are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and/or TA = +125°C. Limits over the operating temperature range and
          relevant supply voltage range are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical values are not guaranteed.
Note 3: When using suggested external 2.2kω series resistors, limits of -3V to +36V apply.
Note 4: fIN refers to the maximum pulse frequency (1/fIN = shortest pulse width) that can be detected from the field sensors and
          switches.
Note 5: External resistor RREF can be adjusted to set any desired current limit between 0.5mA and 6mA.
Note 6: See Figure 9.
Note 7: See Figure 6.
Note 8: See Figure 8.
Note 9: See Figure 7.
Note 10: This is the maximum bit transfer rate through the serializer interface.
Note 11: When input current switching is enabled (DB0/DB1 = 0), there is no input threshold hysteresis. In this case, the input
          threshold for both falling and rising signals is the high-to-low threshold.
