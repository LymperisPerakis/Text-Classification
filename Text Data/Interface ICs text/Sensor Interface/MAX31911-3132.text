MAX31911                                    Industrial, Octal, Digital Input Translator/Serializer
General Description                                          Benefits and Features
The MAX31911 industrial interface serializer translates,     ●● Very Low Power and Heat Dissipation
conditions, and serializes the 24V digital output of sensors    • Low Quiescent Current (1.4mA typ)
and switches used in industrial, process, and building          • Highly Accurate and Stable Input Current Limiters,
automation to 5V CMOS-compatible signals required                  Adjustable from 0.5mA to 6mA
by microcontrollers. It provides the front-end interface     ●● High Integration Reduces BOM Count, Board Size,
circuit of a programmable logic controller (PLC) digital        and System Cost
input module.                                                   • Eight High-Voltage Input Channels (36V max)
The device features integrated current limiting, lowpass        • On-Chip 8-1 Serialization with SPI Interface
filtering, and channel serialization. Input current limiting    • On-Chip 5V Regulator
allows a significant reduction in power consumed from           • On-Chip Overtemperature Indicator
the field voltage supply as compared to traditional discrete    • On-Chip Field Supply Voltage Monitor
resistor-divider implementations. Selectable on-chip lowpass    • Integrated Debounce Filters, Selectable from 0 to 3ms
filters allow flexible debouncing and filtering of sensor    ●● Robust Features and Performance for Industrial
outputs based on the application.                               Environments
On-chip serialization allows a drastic reduction in the         • Multibit CRC Code Generation and Transmission
number of optocouplers used for isolation. The device              for Error Detection and More Reliable Data
serializer is stackable so that any number of input channels       Transmission
can be serialized and output through only one SPI-              • High ESD Immunity on All Field Input Pins
compatible port. This reduces the number of optocouplers     ●● Accepts Industry Standard Input Types
needed to only three, regardless of the number of input         • Configurable for IEC 61131-2 Input Types 1, 2, and 3
channels.                                                    ●● Flexible Power Supply Capability Enables Usage
For enhanced robustness with respect to high-frequency          in 5V, 12V, 24V, and Higher Voltage Systems
noise and fast electrical transients, a multibit CRC code       • Wide Operating Field Supply Range of 7V to 36V
is generated and transmitted through the SPI port for           • Can Be Powered from the Logic-Side Using a 5V
each 8 bits of data. The on-chip 5V voltage regulator can          Supply
be used to power external optocouplers, digital isolators,
                                                             Applications
or other external 5V circuitry.
                                                             ●● Digital Input Modules for PLCs
For ultra-low-power applications, Maxim Integrated offers
                                                             ●● Industrial, Building, and Process Automation
a pin-compatible version of this device, the MAX31910.
                                                             ●● Motor Control
The MAX31910 uses patent-pending circuit techniques to
achieve further reduction of power beyond what is possible
by input current limiting alone.
The MAX31912 and MAX31913 versions include energy-less
LED drivers while maintaining pin compatibility.

Note 2: Limits are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and/or TA = +125°C. Limits over the operating temperature range and
          relevant supply voltage range are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical values are not guaranteed.
Note 3: When using suggested external 2.2kω series resistors, limits of -3V to +36V apply.
Note 4: fIN refers to the maximum pulse frequency (1/fIN = shortest pulse width) that can be detected from the field sensors and
          switches.
Note 5: External resistor RREF can be adjusted to set any desired current limit between 0.5mA and 6mA.
