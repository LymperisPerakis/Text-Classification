Pin description                                                                                         L6362A
2.1         IN1, IN2
            These pins control the output stage on OUTH and OUTL pins, see Table 14: "Output stage
            truth table". When used in push-pull configuration (OUTH and OUTL wired together), the IC
            must be driven by the IN2 pin, to allow the dead time function to protect the output stage.
            The IN1 pin can be wired to GND or VDD depending on the desired polarity. In order to
            avoid IC overstress, in push-pull configuration, IN1 pin has to be hardwired to VDD or GND.
            IN1 could be also actively controlled, but must be switched only while EN/DIAG pin is at a
            low logic level. When used in high-side (OUTL left unconnected) or low-side (OUTH left
            unconnected) configurations, the IC should be driven by the IN1 pin, in order to avoid the
            unnecessary delay, which is introduced by the dead time function. The pin IN2 can be
            wired to GND or VDD depending on the desired polarity, or can be actively controlled (for
            example by a microcontroller).
2.2         EN/DIAG
            This pin controls the output stage on pins OUTH and OUTL. When EN/DIAG is at a low
            logic level (GND), the output stage is disabled. The EN/DIAG pin is also internally wired to
            an open drain transistor, used for diagnostic purposes and must be driven through a series
            resistor. The open drain transistor turns on in case of faults. EN/DIAG pin has an internal
            weak pull-down resistor. If the OUTH and OUTL pins are wired together the IC can be still
            used in HS or LS mode (with slow demagnetization) by applying a fixed high or low level
            voltage to IN1 pin, using the IN2 pin to set the polarity and the EN/DIAG pin to control the
            power stage.
2.3         OUT I/Q
            This pin reports the status of the receiver line (I/Q). It swings from GND to VDD and should
            generally be connected to a microcontroller input. OUT I/Q relation to I/Q is shown in Table
            14: "Output stage truth table" .
2.4         SEL
            This pin cannot be left floating and it allows the linear regulator output voltage to be
            configured at 3.3 V or 5 V.

                     SEL                                        VDD supplied voltage
                     GND                                                3.3 V
                     VDD                                                 5V
2.5         VDD
            This is the output of the integrated linear voltage regulator and the supply voltage of the I/O
            interface. It can supply a small current (Iscr) to a microcontroller or external circuitry. The
            integrated liner regulator could supply the whole system, provided that the amount of
            required current is within IC limits, or the system can be supplied by an external regulator
            and the regulator integrated in the IC supplies the integrated logic only.
2.6         GND
            IC ground.

2.7    OL
       This pin has an open drain structure and is active low. The open drain is active in case of
       overload (current limitation). It can be used by the host microcontroller to detect an IO-Link
       wake-up request event.
2.8    VCC
       IC supply voltage.
2.9    OUTH
       This pin is the output of the high-side power transistor.
2.10   OUTL
       This pin is the output of the low-side power transistor.
2.11   I/Q
       Input pin of the integrated receiver. The level of the signal on I/Q pin is transferred to the
       OUTI/Q pin, according to the receiver thresholds defined in Table 8: "Output stage", and
       truth table see Table 14: "Output stage truth table". In IO-Link mode, OUTH and OUTL
       outputs have to be connected to the load. I/Q pin has to be connected to the load as well,
       through a 22 kΩ resistor. If it is not used, this pin can remain floating; it has to be
       connected to GND to improve EMC robustness.

       The level of the signal on I/Q pin is transferred to the OUT I/Q pin, according to the receiver
       thresholds defined in and truth table below. The receiver is always active independently on
       the EN/DIAG pin status. The IN1 pin sets the phase relation between I/Q and OUT I/Q.

       Notes:
       (1)The receiver keeps working in overtemperature conditions.
       Thanks to the internal pull-up and pull-down resistors on OUTH, OUTL and I/Q pins, the
       receiver logic can be used for the automatic identification of the load connection (high-side
       or low-side) even in the 3-wire configurations. Referring to the table above, the
       microcontroller (μC) can force the EN/DIAG = GND and read the information from OUT I/Q:
       considering the voltage thresholds VI/QTHLH and VI/QTHHL, μC can know whether the
       load is connected in high-side or low-side. The table below summarize the OUT I/Q logic
       level according to the load connection and IN1 set-up.

8.1        Set output stage
           The IC can be operated in high-side, low-side and push-pull mode, according to the
           electrical connections on OUTH and OUTL pins. Depending on the chosen operation
           mode, the IC must be driven by the IN1, IN2 or EN/DIAG pins. Table below refers to normal
           operation mode. For example, in push-pull mode the driving signal (high = VDD, low =
           GND) could be applied to IN2 or EN/DIAG only, while IN1 is connected to VDD or GND. In
           high-side and low-side modes only, the driving signal can be applied to IN1.

8.2        Push-pull (PP) and IO-link operation
           The IC can be operated in push-pull mode, with slow demagnetization, by wiring OUTH
           and OUTL together. When OUTH and OUTL are wired together, IC must be driven by the
           IN2 pin, to allow the dead time function to properly protect the output stage. IN1 pin sets

       operation is active when I/Q pin is connected to OUTH and OUTL by a resistor. According
       to the required protections and EMC levels, it could be necessary to protect the I/Q pin by
       an RC net, see the figure below, Section 11.3: "Current limitation and cut-off" and Table 14:
       "Output stage truth table".

9      Active clamp
       Active clamping is always used in HS and LS configurations. In PP configuration slow
       demagnetization is used. Active clamp is also known as fast demagnetization of inductive
       loads or fast current decay. When a high-side driver turns off an inductance, a reversed
       polarity voltage appears across the load. The OUTH pin is pulled to a voltage below the
       ground until it reaches the demagnetization voltage, V CC-Vdemag. The conduction state is
       linearly modulated by an internal circuitry in order to keep the OUTH pin voltage at about
       VCC -Vdemag until the energy in the load has been dissipated. The energy is dissipated both
       in IC internal switch and load resistance. Similarly, in case of load connected between the
       LS pin and VCC, at the switch-off (of the low-side switch) the output is pushed to +Vdemag.
       See Table 14: "Output stage truth table" for the detailed behavior of the power stage in
       different configurations and conditions.

10        Slow demagnetization
          Slow demagnetization is also known as synchronous rectification or slow current decay and
          it is active in push pull mode. When a high-side driver turns off an inductance, a reversed
          polarity voltage appears across the load. In push-pull configuration the low-side switch is
          ON and the OUTH pin is pulled at a voltage slightly (depending on the low-side switch
          drop) below the ground. The energy is dissipated in both IC internal switch and load
          resistance. Similarly, in case of load connected between the OUTL pin and VCC, at the
          switch-off of the low-side switch, the HS switch is ON and the output is pushed to a voltage
          slightly higher than VCC. Slow demagnetization is always active in PP configurations: the
          diodes of the integrated switches activate the slow demagnetization even when the IC is
          driven by EN/DIAG instead of IN2. See Table 14: "Output stage truth table" for the detailed
          behavior of the power stage in different configurations and conditions.

11          Protection and diagnostic
            The IC integrates several protections to ease the design of a robust application. Protection
            functions are intended to avoid IC damage in fault conditions and are not intended for
            continuous operation. Continuous and repetitive operations of protection functions may
            reduce the IC lifetime.

            Notes:
            (1)Active clamp (fast demagnetization) is active in case of residual currents on OUTH or OUTL. If OUTH and
            OUTL are wired together, slow demagnetization is used only in case of overtemperature protection intervention.
            (2)When   VCC < 2.5 V (typ.), the device is completely turned off.
11.1        Undervoltage lock-out
            The output stage, the receiver and several internal circuitries turn off as the supply voltage
            falls below the turn-off threshold (VUVOFF). Normal operation restarts, after VCC exceeds the
            turn-on threshold (VUVON). Turn-on and turn-off thresholds are defined in table Table 7:
            "Supply".
11.2        Overtemperature
            The output stage turns off as the internal IC temperature (T J) exceeds the shutdown
            temperature see Table 11: "Electrical characteristics, logic inputs (IN1, IN2, EN/DIAG and
            SEL) ". Normal operation restarts when the TJ goes back below the restart temperature (T jr)
            and, in case the cut-off protection is triggered too, after the trout delay time expires.
11.3        Current limitation and cut-off
            The output current of the power stage is internally limited, see Table 12: "Protection and
            diagnostic".
            The current limitation circuit is active when the output current triggers peak threshold (I OHS-
            PEAK for high-side, IOLS-PEAK for low-side) by limiting the output current to IOHS (or IOLS for low-
            side). The current limitation persists until the current required by the load becomes lower
            than the limitation level (IOHS or IOLS).

       If the output stage remains in a current limitation condition for a time longer than the tdOUT
       delay, the cut-off occurs, therefore the output stage turns off and restarts after the trOUT
       restart time. Please notice that the power dissipated by the IC can be significantly high in
       current limitation condition.
                                Figure 13: Output current in overload condition
11.4   Dead time
       Dead time protection is also known as cross-conduction or shoot-through protection. When
       used in push-pull configuration, OUTH and OUTL pins are wired together. A dead time is
       necessary between each high-side switch (HS) turn-off and low-side switch (LS) turn-on,
       and vice versa, in order to avoid cross-conduction of the two switches. The IC integrates a
       dead time generator to properly drive the output stage avoiding cross-conduction. The
       dead time is inserted only when the IN2 pin changes its state. The dead time is not inserted
       when IN1 or EN/DIAG pin changes its state. The IC must be driven by the IN2 pin in case
       of push-pull configuration (OUTH and OUTL wired together). The IC should be driven by
       IN1 in case of HS (OUTL left unconnected) or LS (OUTH left unconnected) configurations,
       in order to avoid unnecessary delays when the output switch turns on. In any case, the
       EN/DIAG pin can be also driven by an external source (for example a microcontroller).
11.5   EN/DIAG pin
       The EN/DIAG pin is internally wired to a diagnostic open drain transistor, so it must be
       driven by a series resistor only. The open drain transistor is active (turn-on) while any of the
       following fault conditions is present, independently on the INx pin state:
            Undervoltage lock-out (2.5 V < VCC < VUVOFF)
            Overtemperature detected (TJ is above the threshold specified in Table 12: "Protection
             and diagnostic"
            The output turns off due to the cut-off protection
       Please note that in case of faults, the output stage (OUTH and OUTL) is disabled by an
       internal path, independently on the status of the EN/DIAG pin. Besides, note that the
       diagnostic signal is not visible if the EN/DIAG pin is pulled low from the microcontroller.

11.6        OL (overload) pin
            The integrated open drain transistor is active (turn-on) in case of overload conditions.
            Overload is detected when the output current exceeds the IOLS-PEAK or IOHS-PEAK threshold.
            The open drain transistor is active with a small delay (t OL), after the overload condition is
            detected. Overload is not detected when EN/DIAG pin is at a low logic level. Overload is
            not detected in cut-off conditions: if the output stage remains in a current limitation (OL)
            condition for a time longer than the tdOUT delay, the output stage is turned off (cut-off
            condition) and the OL pin is released. The output stage is restarted after the t rOUT restart
            time.
11.7        Reverse polarity protection
             The integrated reverse polarity protection (RPP) avoids any damage to the IC in case of
            erroneous swapped connection of the high voltage pins to the supply and reference rails.
            These protected pins, despite reverse polarity, are: VCC, GND, OUTH, OUTL and I/Q. In
            order to protect the IC against any reverse current from load (e.g due to different and
            unbalanced supply load voltage rails), please refer to section below.
11.8        GND/VCC open wire protection
             The GND and VCC open wire protections are intended as protections against the
            disconnection of the application module from ground and/or supply rails. The IC is self-
            protected against these events both for high-side and low-side configurations.
            For Push-Pull configuration an external blocking diode in series to OUTH is necessary if
            load is connected to VCC supply rail. An external diode in series to OUTL is necessary if the
            load is connected to GND reference rail.
                                Figure 14: PP configuration, open wire external protections
            The same considerations for PP configuration are valid for IO-Link configuration.
            Furthermore, the external resistor between I/Q and load has to be selected to force the IC
            in UVLO off. A 22 kOhm resistor protects the IC up to VCC = 36 V, even though a lower
            value resistance can be used according to the following design rule:
            Rext = [VCC(max.) - Vuvoff(min.)]/ICC(min.)
            Despite the presence of the external components listed above, the IC is able to meet the
            standard EMC requirements according to IEC 60947-5-2. Only if higher voltage levels are
            necessary, then a small CI/Q capacitance between I/Q and GND could be necessary: the
