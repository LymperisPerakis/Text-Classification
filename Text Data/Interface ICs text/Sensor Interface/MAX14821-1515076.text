 The Status register reflects the logic levels of C/Q and DI and shows the source of interrupts that cause an IRQ
 hardware interrupt. The IRQ interrupt is asserted when an alarm condition (OTemp, UV33Int, UV24, C/QFault,
 DoFault, WuInt) is detected. All bits in the Status register are read-only. The interrupt bits return to the default state
 after the Status register is read. If a C/Q or DO fault condition persists, the associated interrupt bits are immediately
 set after the Status register is read.

                                    Fault Detection section for more information). IRQ asserts when C/QFault is 1. Read the
                                    Status register to clear the C/QFaultInt bit and deassert IRQ.
                                    Internal 3.3V LDO (LDO33) Undervoltage Warning. Both the UV33Int interrupt bit and
                                    the UV33En bit (in the Mode register) are set when VLDO33 falls below the 2.4V LDO33
                                    undervoltage threshold. If UV33En is set in the Mode register, IRQ asserts low when the
       D2                UV33Int    UV33Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV33Int bit and deassert IRQ.
                                    Set the UV33En bit to 1 in the Mode register to enable undervoltage monitoring for
                                    UV33Int. When enabled, UV asserts high when the UV33Int bit is 1. UV deasserts when
                                    VLDO33 rises above the LDO33 undervoltage threshold.
                                    VCC Undervoltage Interrupt. The UV24Int interrupt bit and the UV24 bit (in the Mode
                                    register) are set when the VCC voltage falls below the 7.4V undervoltage threshold. IRQ

                                    asserts low when the UV24Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV24Int bit
                                    and deassert IRQ. VCC undervoltage detection cannot be disabled.
                                    Overtemperature Warning. The OTempInt interrupt bit and the OTemp bit (in the Mode
                                    register) are set when a high-temperature condition is detected by the device. OTemp
                                    is set when the temperature of the die exceeds +115NC (typ). OTempInt is set and IRQ
       D0               OTempInt    asserts when the OTemp bit is 1. The OTempInt bit is cleared and IRQ deasserts when
                                    the Status register is read.
                                    Once cleared, OTempInt is not reset if the die temperature remains above the thermal
                                    warning threshold and does not fall below +95°C.

        BIT                     NAME                                               DESCRIPTION
                                              C/Q and DI Receiver Filter Control. The C/Q and DI receivers have analog
                                              lowpass filters to reduce high-frequency noise on the receiver inputs. Set the
                                              RxFilter bit to 0 to set the filter corner frequency to 500kHz. Set the RxFilter
         D7                    RxFilter       bit to 1 to set the filter corner frequency to 1MHz (this setting is used for high-
                                              speed COM3 operation).
                                              Noise filters on C/Q and DI are controlled simultaneously by the RxFilter bit.
                                              Slew-Rate Control. The HiSlew bit increases the slew rate for the C/Q and
         D6                     HiSlew        DO drivers and is used for high-speed COM3 (230kbps) data rates. Set
                                              HiSlew to 0 for COM1 and COM2 operation.
                                              C/Q Driver NPN/PNP Mode. The C/Q_N/P bit selects between low-side (NPN)
                                              and high-side (PNP) modes when the C/Q driver is configured as an open-
         D5                    C/Q_N/P
                                              drain output (C/Q_PP = 0). Set C/Q_N/P to 1 to configure the driver for low-side
                                              (NPN) operation. Set C/Q_N/P to 0 for high-side (PNP) operation.
                                              C/Q Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set C/Q_PP to 1 to enable push-pull
         D4                    C/Q_PP
                                              operation on the C/Q driver. The C/Q output is open-drain when C/Q_PP is 0.
                                              C/Q Driver Enable/Disable. Set the C/QDEn bit to 1 to enable the C/Q driver.
         D3                    C/QDEn
                                              Set C/QDEn to 0 for hardware (TXEN) control. See Table 4.
                                              C/Q Driver Output Logic. The Q bit can be used to program the C/Q output
                                              driver through software. The C/Q driver must be enabled and TXC = TXQ must
                                              be high to control the C/Q driver through the Q bit (Figure 8). C/Q has the
                                              same logic polarity as the Q bit.

                                              Set the Q bit to 0 to control the C/Q driver with TXC and TXQ.
                                              The C/Q driver output state depends on the C/Q_PP and C/Q_N/P bits as
                                              shown in Table 5. Note that Table 5 assumes that the C/Q driver is enabled
                                              (TXEN = VL or C/QDEn = 1).
                                              C/Q Receiver Enable/Disable. Set the RxDis bit to 1 to disable the C/Q
         D1                      RxDis
                                              receiver. The RX output is high when RxDis is 1.
                                              C/Q Current Sink Enable. Set the C/QLoad bit to 1 to enable the internal
         D0                   C/QLoad
                                              current sink at C/Q.

                                                   DO Output Polarity. Set the DoInv bit to 1 to invert the logic of the DO
                                                   output. This bit also works in conjunction with the DoAv (Table 6). DO
            D7                    DoInv
                                                   tracks the TXC and TXQ inputs with the opposite polarity when both the
                                                   DoAv and DoInv bits are set.
                                                   DO Antivalent Operation. Set the DoAv bit to 1 to enable antivalent
                                                   output operation on DO. DO tracks the TXC and TXQ inputs (and the Q
            D6                    DoAv             bit) when DoAv is 1 (Table 6).
                                                   The LO input and the DoBit are ignored when the DoAv bit is 1.
                                                   DO Driver NPN/PNP Operation. The DoN/P bit selects between low-
                                                   side (NPN) and high-side (PNP) modes when the DO driver is configured
            D5                   DoN/P             as an open-drain output (DoPP = 0). Set DoN/P to 1 to configure the
                                                   driver for low-side (NPN) operation. Set DoN/P to 0 for high-side (PNP)
                                                   operation.
                                                   DO Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set the DoPP bit to 1 to configure the
            D4                    DoPP             DO driver output for push-pull operation. DO is an open-drain output
                                                   when DoPP is 0.
                                                   DO Driver Enable/Disable. Set the DoEn bit to 1 to enable the DO
            D3                    DoEn             driver. The DO driver is high impedance with a weak pulldown when

                                                   that Table 7 assumes that the DoInv bit is 0.

 Use the Mode register to reset the MAX14821 and manage the 3.3V LDO. The Mode register has bits that represent
 the current status of fault conditions. When writing to the Mode register, the contents of the fault indication bits
 (bits 2 to 5) do not change.
        BIT                NAME                                                DESCRIPTION
                                        Register Reset. Set RST to 1 to reset all registers to their default power-up state. Then
                                        set RST to 0 for normal operation.

                                        The Status register is cleared and IRQ deasserts (if asserted) when RST = 1. Interrupts
                                        are not generated while RST = 1.
                                        Wake-Up Interrupt Enable. Set WuIntEn to 1 to enable wake-up interrupt generation.
                                        When WuIntEn is set, the WuInt bit in the Status register is set and IRQ asserts when
                                        a valid wake-up condition is detected. The C/Q driver must be enabled for wake-up
         D6               WuIntEn       detection. The state of WuIntEn does not affect the WU output. See the Wake-Up Detection
                                        section for more information. When the IO-Link device is in IO-Link communication
                                        mode, the WuInt bit should be set to 0, so that interrupts are not generated for false
                                        wake-up events.
                                        DO Fault Status. The DoFault bit is set when a short circuit or voltage fault occurs at
                                        the DO driver output (see the DO Fault Detection section for more information). The

                                        DoFault and DoFaultInt bits are both set when a fault occurs on DO. DoFault is cleared
                                        when the fault is removed.
                                        C/Q Fault Status. The C/QFault bit is set when a short circuit or voltage fault occurs at
                                        the C/Q driver output (see the C/Q Fault Detection section for more information). The
         D4               C/QFault
                                        C/QFault and C/QFaultInt bits are both set when a fault occurs on C/Q. C/QFault is
                                        cleared when the fault is removed.
                                        VCC Undervoltage Condition. Both the UV24 and the UV24Int bits are set when VCC
         D3                UV24         falls below VCCUVLO. UV24 is cleared when VCC rises above the VCC threshold. V5
                                        must be present for VCC undervoltage monitoring.
                                        Temperature Warning. The OTemp bit is set when a high-temperature condition
                                        occurs on the device. Both the OTempInt interrupt in the Status register and the OTemp
         D2               OTemp
                                        bit are set when the junction temperature of the die rises to above +115NC (typ). The
                                        OTemp bit is cleared when the junction temperature falls below +95NC (typ).
                                        LDO33 UV Enable. Set the UV33En bit to 1 to assert the UV output when LDO33
                                        voltage falls below the 2.4V (typ) undervoltage-lockout threshold. The UV33En bit does
