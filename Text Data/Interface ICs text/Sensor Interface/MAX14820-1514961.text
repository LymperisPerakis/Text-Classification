 X = Unknown. These bits are dependent on the DI logic and C/Q inputs.
 The Status register reflects the logic levels of C/Q and DI and shows the source of interrupts that cause an IRQ hardware inter-
 rupt. The IRQ interrupt is asserted when an alarm condition (OTemp, UV33Int, UV24, C/QFault, DoFault, WuInt) is detected. All
 bits in the Status register are read-only. The interrupt bits return to the default state after the Status register is read. If a C/Q or
 DO fault condition persists, the associated interrupt bits are immediately set after the Status register is read.
          BIT                NAME                                                   DESCRIPTION
                                             Wake-Up Interrupt Request. WuInt is set when an IO-Link wake-up request pulse is
          D7                  Wulnt          detected on C/Q and the WuIntEn bit in the Mode register is set. IRQ asserts when
                                             WuInt is set to 1. Read the Status register to clear the WuInt bit and deassert IRQ.
                                             DO Fault Interrupt. DoFaultInt interrupt bit and DoFault bit (in the Mode register) are
                                             set when a fault condition occurs on the DO driver output. The device registers a fault
          D6               DoFaultInt        condition when a short circuit or voltage fault is detected on DO (see the DO Fault
                                             Detection section for more information). IRQ asserts when DoFaultInt is 1. Read the
                                             Status register to clear the DoFaultInt bit and deassert IRQ.
                                             DI Logic Level. The DiLvl bit mirrors the current logic level at the DI input. It is the
          D5                  DiLvl          inverse of the LI output and is always active regardless of the state of the LiDis bit (Table
                                             2). DiLvl does not affect IRQ. DiLvl is not changed when the Status register is read.

        BIT        NAME                                            DESCRIPTION
                             C/Q Logic Level. The QLvl bit is the inverse of the logic level at C/Q. QLvl is 1 when the
        D4                   C/Q input level is low (< 8V) and is 0 when the C/Q logic level is high (> 13V) (Table 3).
                    QLvl
                             QLvl remains active when the C/Q receiver is disabled (RxDis = 1). QLvl does not affect
                             IRQ. QLvl is not changed when the Status register is read.
                             C/Q Fault Interrupt. The C/QFaultInt interrupt bit and C/QFault bit (in the Mode register)
                             are set when a short circuit or voltage fault occurs on the C/Q driver output (see the C/Q
        D3       C/QFaultInt
                             Fault Detection section for more information). IRQ asserts when C/QFault is 1. Read the
                             Status register to clear the C/QFaultInt bit and deassert IRQ.
                             Internal 3.3V LDO (LDO33) Undervoltage Warning. Both the UV33Int interrupt bit and
                             the UV33En bit (in the Mode register) are set when VLDO33 falls below the 2.4V LDO33
                             undervoltage threshold. If UV33En is set in the Mode register, IRQ asserts low when the
        D2         UV33Int   UV33Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV33Int bit and deassert IRQ.
                             Set the UV33En bit to 1 in the Mode register to enable undervoltage monitoring for
                             UV33Int. When enabled, UV asserts high when the UV33Int bit is 1. UV deasserts when
                             VLDO33 rises above the LDO33 undervoltage threshold.
                             VCC Undervoltage Interrupt. The UV24Int interrupt bit and the UV24 bit (in the Mode
                             register) are set when the VCC voltage falls below the 7.4V undervoltage threshold. IRQ
        D1         UV24Int
                             asserts low when the UV24Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV24Int bit
                             and deassert IRQ. VCC undervoltage detection cannot be disabled.
                             Overtemperature Warning. The OTempInt interrupt bit and the OTemp bit (in the Mode
                             register) are set when a high-temperature condition is detected by the devices. OTemp
                             is set when the temperature of the die exceeds +115NC (typ). OTempInt is set and IRQ
        D0        OTempInt   asserts when the OTemp bit is 1. The OTempInt bit is cleared and IRQ deasserts when
                             the Status register is read.
                             Once cleared, OTempInt is not reset if the die temperature remains above the thermal
                             warning threshold and does not fall below +95°C.

 Use the CQConfig register to control the C/Q receiver and driver parameters. All bits in the CQConfig register are
 read-write and are set to 0 at power-up.
         BIT                    NAME                                               DESCRIPTION
                                              C/Q and DI Receiver Filter Control. The C/Q and DI receivers have analog
                                              lowpass filters to reduce high-frequency noise on the receiver inputs. Set the
                                              RxFilter bit to 0 to set the filter corner frequency to 500kHz. Set the RxFilter
          D7                   RxFilter       bit to 1 to set the filter corner frequency to 1MHz (this setting is used for high-
                                              speed COM3 operation).
                                              Noise filters on C/Q and DI are controlled simultaneously by the RxFilter bit.
                                              Slew-Rate Control. The HiSlew bit increases the slew rate for the C/Q and
          D6                    HiSlew        DO drivers and is used for high-speed COM3 (230kbps) data rates. Set
                                              HiSlew to 0 for COM1 and COM2 operation.
                                              C/Q Driver NPN/PNP Mode. The C/Q_N/P bit selects between low-side (NPN)
                                              and high-side (PNP) modes when the C/Q driver is configured as an open-
          D5                   C/Q_N/P
                                              drain output (C/Q_PP = 0). Set C/Q_N/P to 1 to configure the driver for low-side
                                              (NPN) operation. Set C/Q_N/P to 0 for high-side (PNP) operation.
                                              C/Q Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set C/Q_PP to 1 to enable push-pull
          D4                   C/Q_PP
                                              operation on the C/Q driver. The C/Q output is open-drain when C/Q_PP is 0.
                                              C/Q Driver Enable/Disable. Set the C/QDEn bit to 1 to enable the C/Q driver.
          D3                   C/QDEn
                                              Set C/QDEn to 0 for hardware (TXEN) control. See Table 4.
                                              C/Q Driver Output Logic. The Q bit can be used to program the C/Q output
                                              driver through software. The C/Q driver must be enabled and TXC = TXQ must
                                              be high to control the C/Q driver through the Q bit (Figure 8). C/Q has the
                                              same logic polarity as the Q bit.
          D2                      Q
                                              Set the Q bit to 0 to control the C/Q driver with TXC and TXQ.
                                              The C/Q driver output state depends on the C/Q_PP and C/Q_N/P bits as
                                              shown in Table 5. Note that Table 5 assumes that the C/Q driver is enabled
                                              (TXEN = VL or C/QDEn = 1).
                                              C/Q Receiver Enable/Disable. Set the RxDis bit to 1 to disable the C/Q
          D1                     RxDis
                                              receiver. The RX output is high when RxDis is 1.
                                              C/Q Current Sink Enable. Set the C/QLoad bit to 1 to enable the internal
          D0                  C/QLoad
                                              current sink at C/Q.

 Use the DIOConfig register to control the DI and DO interfaces. All bits in the DIOConfig register are read-write and
 are set to 0 at power-up.

                                                   DO Output Polarity. Set the DoInv bit to 1 to invert the logic of the DO
                                                   output. This bit also works in conjunction with the DoAv (Table 6). DO
            D7                    DoInv
                                                   tracks the TXC and TXQ inputs with the opposite polarity when both the
                                                   DoAv and DoInv bits are set.
                                                   DO Antivalent Operation. Set the DoAv bit to 1 to enable antivalent
                                                   output operation on DO. DO tracks the TXC and TXQ inputs (and the Q
            D6                    DoAv             bit) when DoAv is 1 (Table 6).
                                                   The LO input and the DoBit are ignored when the DoAv bit is 1.
                                                   DO Driver NPN/PNP Operation. The DoN/P bit selects between low-
                                                   side (NPN) and high-side (PNP) modes when the DO driver is configured
            D5                   DoN/P             as an open-drain output (DoPP = 0). Set DoN/P to 1 to configure the
                                                   driver for low-side (NPN) operation. Set DoN/P to 0 for high-side (PNP)
                                                   operation.
                                                   DO Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set the DoPP bit to 1 to configure the
            D4                    DoPP             DO driver output for push-pull operation. DO is an open-drain output
                                                   when DoPP is 0.
                                                   DO Driver Enable/Disable. Set the DoEn bit to 1 to enable the DO
            D3                    DoEn             driver. The DO driver is high impedance with a weak pulldown when
                                                   DoEn is 0.
                                                   DO Driver Output Logic. The DoBit bit can be used to program the
                                                   DO output driver through software. Drive LO high to activate DoBit

                                                   programming (Figure 9). The DO output state is given in Table 7. Note
                                                   that Table 7 assumes that the DoInv bit is 0.
                                                   LI Output Enable/Disable. Set the LiDis bit to 1 to disable the LI output.

                                                   The LI output is low when LiDis is 1.
                                                   DI Current Sink Enable. Set the DiLoad bit to 1 to enable the internal
            D0                   DiLoad
                                                   current sink at the DI input.
