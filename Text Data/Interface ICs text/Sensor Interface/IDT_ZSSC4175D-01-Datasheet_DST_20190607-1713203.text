1. Pin Assignments
The ZSSC4175D-01 is available in a 24-QFN (4  4 mm; wettable flanks) RoHS-conformant package.
Note: The backside of the 24-QFN package (exposed pad; see section 13) is electrically connected to VSSA.
Recommendation: On the printed circuit board (PCB), the land pattern of the exposed pad should be shorted to the solder pad of the VSSA pin.
The exposed pad of the 24-QFN package should be soldered to reduce thermal resistance.

7. Circuit Description
7.1       General Operation Description
The ZSSC4175D-01 is a sensor signal conditioner for readout of thermocouple elements. The thermocouple signal is pre-amplified and
converted to a digital signal by the analog-to-digital-converter (ADC). Then the digital conversion result is compensated in terms of thermocouple
nonlinearity and internal temperature measurement. Then the calculated conditioning result is output using the SENT protocol.
Signal conditioning processes the following tasks:
 Measurement of the voltage signal from the connected thermocouple element
 Measurement of internal temperature for cold junction compensation
 Diagnostic monitors for chip functionality
 Diagnostic monitors for thermocouple elements
 Conditioning calculation for the thermocouple signal
 SENT output of the conditioning result

                                                                                                                                        ZSSC4175D-01 Datasheet
7.2      Signal Path
The ZSSC4175D-01 signal path consists of the analog front-end (AFE), the digital signal processing unit, the SENT Controller, and the SENT
physical interface (SENT PHY). In addition, the SENT PHY supports a serial digital one-wire interface (ZACwire™).
Each thermocouple signal is input via the BR1P and BR1N pins, or the BR2P and BR2N pins, and is handled as a fully differential signal. Both
signal lines have a dynamic range symmetrical to the common mode potential (analog ground; equal to VDDA/2) so that it is possible to process
positive and negative differential input signals. These differential signals are pre-amplified by the programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and are
converted to digital values by the A/D converter (ADC).
A multiplexer (MUX) selects and transmits the signals from either the thermocouple element or the internal temperature sensor to the analog-
to-digital converter (ADC) in a defined sequence.
The digital signal correction is processed in the calibration microcontroller (CMC) using thermocouple element-specific coefficients stored in the
NVM. The configuration data and the conditioning coefficients are programmed into the NVM during the manufacturing process by digital one-
wire communication via the DOUT pins depending on the final application use case.
During the manufacturing process, raw measurement values provided by the IDT test center can be requested for calculation and fine-tuning
of the overall system performance parameters via the digital interfaces.
The ZSSC4175D-01 provides SENT transmission according to the SAE J2716 JAN2010 (SENT Rev. 3) and APR2016 (SENT Rev. 4).
Depending on the programmed configuration, there are several SENT output modes. These modes include assignment of the various sensor
signals to the SENT Fast and Serial Data Message (SDM) communication channels as well as the configuration of the SENT frame itself.

                                                                                                                     ZSSC4175D-01 Datasheet
7.3       Signal Conditioning
7.3.1      Thermocouple Sensor Signal Conditioning
The ZSSC4175D-01 uses a spline interpolation for compensation of thermocouple nonlinearity. The spline formula uses thermocouple element-
specific coefficients stored in the NVM. Signal conditioning will map thermocouple input data to a standardized SENT output format. The formula
and coefficient handling are described in the Configuration Description Report (CDR) included with the product delivery. Thermocouple
conditioning is processed every time that a new thermocouple input value is available. Therefore, the repetition time of the thermocouple
measurement will define the internal output update rate (OUR).
7.3.2      Internal Temperature Sensor Signal Conditioning
The internal temperature sensor signal conditioning is processed every time that a new internal temperature measurement result value is
available from the analog-to-digital conversion. The conditioning calculation provides compensation of offset and gain, and of the nonlinearity.
7.4       Analog Front-End
7.4.1      Overview
The analog front-end (AFE) consists of the multiplexer (MUX), the programmable gain amplifier (PGA), and the analog-to-digital converter
(ADC). The internal offset of the analog front-end is eliminated by an auto-zero compensation.
7.4.2      SCCM
The sensor connection check module (SCCM) provides the thermocouple supply voltage and the connection check functionality. It can measure
the required driving current and can inject a current into the bridge pins.
7.4.3      Input Multiplexer
The input multiplexer (MUX) selects one of the various inputs and connects it to the signal path utilizing a single ADC. It allows a very flexible
signal routing between the thermocouple elements and the ZSSC4175D-01.
7.4.4      Programmable Gain Amplifier
Thermocouple input voltage will be preamplified before it is passed to ADC. The gain is configured to a fixed value. The adjustment for the
SENT output can be done with coefficients in the NVM.
7.4.5      Analog-to-Digital Converter
The analog-to-digital converter is implemented using the full-differential switched-capacitor technique. The conversion is largely insensitive to
short-term and long-term instabilities of the clock frequency. The ADC provides adjustability of the A/D conversion input voltage range.
7.5       Signal Measurement
7.5.1      Thermocouple Element Measurement
The ZSSC4175D-01 measures two differential signals (BR1P to BR1N and BR2P to BR2N). The signal path is ratiometric and fully differential.
The ratiometric reference voltage VREF is equal to internal bandgap voltage.
7.5.2      Internal Temperature Measurement
The ZSSC4175D-01 supports an internal proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) measurement. This temperature will be used for cold
junction compensation and SENT output if selected. The temperature offset between the cold junction temperature and the IC temperature after
self-heating can be adjusted with coefficients in the NVM.

7.5.3       Isolation Conductance Measurement (Giso)
The ZSSC4175D-01 measures the required supply current to bias the BR1P and BR2P pins. This is used to calculate an equivalent resistance
value connected to the supply. This is used to detect a short to the supply or ground if the resistance is lower than the limit.
7.5.4       Thermocouple Resistor Measurement (Ropen)
The ZSSC4175D-01 injects current into the BR1N and BR2N pins to measure the thermocouple resistance. This is used to detect an open
connection of the thermocouple if the resistance is above the limit.
7.5.5       Measurement Cycle
The measurement cycle is the sequence of measurements processed during the Normal Operation Mode (NOM). It delivers the raw
measurement results from all connected thermocouples and from the supervision functions. The measurements are processed sequentially, all
using the ADC to convert the analog input voltages to a digital value.
All measurement tasks will create the measurement cycle that is processed in a loop during NOM continuously. All measurements are executed
at least once in this measurement cycle. Measurement tasks that are related to thermocouple measurements are measured most frequently in
the main measurement slots while all other measurements are inserted alternatively as auxiliary measurements.
The sequence of measurements is retained even if any fault check connected to a measurement is disabled. The sensor signal conditioning is
synchronized to the main measurement tasks to ensure a regular internal output update rate.
The list of available measurements and the complete measurement cycle are explained in the Configuration Description Report (CDR).
7.6        SENT Output
7.6.1       Overview
The ZSSC4175D-01 provides three different digital interfaces for the output of data and status messages:
 The SENT controller and physical layer for SENT transmission complies with the SAE J2716 JAN2010 (SENT Rev. 3) and APR2016
     (SENT Rev. 4) and enables readout of the conditioned thermocouple signal data.
      SAE 27J16 JAN2010 (SENT Rev. 3) specifies up to 32 SDM messages in one SDM cycle.
      SAE 27J16 APR2016 (SENT Rev. 4) specifies up to 64 SDM messages in one SDM cycle. This is supported in regards to the absolute
        number of SDMs in one cycle, but the amount of different SDMs is limited to 32
 The ZACwire™ interface for one-wire communication supports the sensor configuration and manufacturing process.
 The I2C interface supports the sensor configuration and manufacturing process.
The SENT interface is the main application output interface. The configuration of the SENT frame format and the assignment of thermocouple
signals and fault messages to the SENT output channels are configurable.
In addition to other protocols, the SENT interface supports the application-specific SENT protocols* High Temperature Sensor (T or T/t), Single
High Temperature Secure Sensor (T/S or T/S/t) and High Temperature / High Temperature Sensor (T1/T2 or T1/T2/t).
* According to SAE J2716 APR2016 (SENT Rev. 4) because JAN2010 does not provide a detailed SENT sensor class for high temperature sensors.

In the SENT protocols, the following abbreviations are used:
    T = Temperature information used in Fast Channel
    S = Secure counter used in Fast Channel (only available in H.5 and H.4 *)
    t = Cold junction temperature

 DP_019               SENT Protocol High Temperature / High Temperature Sensor T1/T1 and T1/T2/t
7.6.2       SENT Fast Channel Modes and Frame Format
The ZSSC4175D-01 SENT interface supports various frame configurations:
 SENT Fast Channel Mode: one or two Fast data channels.
 SENT Transmission Mode: fixed SENT frame length and adjustable pause pulse, or SENT transmission without pause pulse.
The ZSSC4175D-01 provides the following different Fast data channel modes:
 12-bit FC1 (3 nibbles) (H.2 *)
 12-bit FC1 and 12-bit FC2 (6 nibbles) (H.1 *)
 12-bit FC1, 8-bit rolling counter and 4-bit zero (6 nibbles) (H.5 *)
 12-bit FC1, 8-bit rolling counter and 4-bit MSN of FC1 inverted (6 nibbles) (H.4 *)
The SENT frame transmission is not synchronized to the ZSSC4175D-01 internal output data update. The internal output data update is
determined by the fixed ADC resolution for the thermocouple element signal measurements and supervision function measurements. The output
update rate and the SENT frame length are generally different. Depending on the SENT frame length used, it is possible that individual data is
either sent twice or it is skipped and not sent at all.
After power-on, the initial output values of the SENT Fast data channels are defined by the selected SENT output mode as described in
section 7.6.4.

                                                                                                                      ZSSC4175D-01 Datasheet
7.6.4      SENT Output Operation Modes
The ZSSC4175D-01 provides SENT output of the conditioned thermocouple element measurement results at the DOUT pin. This pin is also
connected to the ZACwire™ interface for “End of Line” communication using a one-wire communication protocol (OWI).
There are four different modes for starting the OWI communication in combination with the SENT output:
After Initialization:
 SENT transmission starts immediately after the initialization phase.
 During the initialization, the DOUT pin is set to the output idle state.
 SENT data channels are set to their initial value (usually “0”) until the first valid thermocouple element values are available.
 OWI Rx is enabled in parallel with the SENT output for a time window.
 OWI communication can be started by transmitting the command for starting the Command Mode (CM) during this time window. The
    communication master must overwrite the output potential at the DOUT pin for transmitting the first command (DOUT pin drive capability
    is current limited).
After First Measurement:
 SENT transmission starts after the first measurement and conditioning cycle and thus with the first valid thermocouple element values.
 During the initialization and the first cycle, the DOUT pin is set to the output idle state.
 SENT data channels start transmission with valid values.
 This mode allows the fastest possible transmission of the first thermocouple data after power on.
 OWI Rx is enabled in parallel to the SENT output for a time window.
 OWI communication can be started by transmitting the command for starting CM during this time window. The communication master
    must overwrite the output potential at the DOUT pin for transmitting the first command (DOUT pin drive capability is current limited).
After 250ms:
 SENT transmission starts only after a time window (approximately 250ms). The DOUT pin is set to the output idle state.
 DOUT is weakly pulled to VDDA (pull-up current: ~2.5µA). OWI Rx is enabled for a specified time window.
 OWI communication can be started by transmitting the command for starting CM during this time window.
Disable SENT:
 SENT transmission is disabled. OWI Rx/Tx is enabled without time limitation. OWI communication can be started by transmitting the
    command for starting CM.
The output idle state of the ZSSC4175D-01 is defined as follows:
 The DOUT pin is switched to high impedance; DOUT is weakly pulled to VDDA (pull-up current: ~2.5µA).
 The final resulting potential at the output is defined by the (pull-up) load resistor at the SENT communication line.

7.6.5       SENT Pulse Shaping
The ZSSC4175D-01 has several fixed adjustment options optimized for rise and fall times depending on the SENT tick time. This helps obtain
optimal EMC performance regarding electromagnetic emission.
7.7        NVM OEM Data Memory
The ZSSC4175D-01 provides a NVM memory area for the storage of OEM data, which is physically part of the NVM memory module (OTP;
i.e., one-time programmable) but is delimited from the configuration and calibration data by dedicated commands for read and write access.
Data protection and multiple-time programming data management must be implemented by the OEM.

7.8        Over-Voltage and Short-Circuit Protection
The ZSSC4175D-01 is designed for a 5V supply provided by an electronic control unit (ECU).
The ZSSC4175D-01 and the connected thermocouples are protected from over-voltage and reverse-polarity damage by an internal supply
voltage limiter. The SENT output pin DOUT is protected regarding short circuits, over-voltage conditions, and reverse polarity. These functions
are described in Table 11 and are valid for operation of the ZSSC4175D-01 in the application circuit shown in section 10 within the specifications
of absolute maximum ratings given in section 3.
Note: The specified junction temperature range TJ_ABS (Table 2) is in force not only for operation but also for all the protection cases listed in
Table 11. In the event of an over-voltage, the device might have increased power dissipation. Depending on the thermocouple temperature,
which results in a different RISO value, and depending on the output load, this might lead to a violation of the maximum junction temperature.

8. Fault-Safe Operation
8.1      Fault-Safe Operation Modes
Fault checks verify the operation of the ZSSC4175D-01 and of the connected thermocouple element at power-on and during Normal Operation
Mode (NOM). If a fault is detected, the Diagnostic Mode (DM) is activated and the fault status is provided via one of the two methods described
below depending on the diagnostic mode.
The ZSSC4175D-01 differentiates between two DMs with different behavior:
Static Diagnostic Mode
 Measurement and conditioning cycle are interrupted.
 SENT transmission is stopped, and the output pin DOUT is either driven to a HIGH output level or is switched to high impedance.
 The ZACwire™ interface for one-wire communication (OWI) is enabled; both RAM output pages are readable. The command
    StrtCmdMd must be sent to switch to Command Mode for further command processing.
 If enabled, the watchdog will trigger reset, i.e. the ZSSC4175D-01 is restarted including a reset of all status registers.
 The ZSSC4175D-01 can be restarted by a power-off/power-on sequence.
Temporary Diagnostic Mode
 Measurement and conditioning cycle are continuously processed.
 Fault checks are continuously processed including fault confirmation (see below).
 SENT transmission is continued. At least one of the following fault messaging options is activated:
     The fault code is transmitted in the SENT Fast Channel.
     Fault bit(s) are set in the SENT status nibble.
     The fault code is transmitted in the SDM Channel (SENT fault messaging and fault codes are configurable).
   The ZACwire™ interface for one-wire communication (OWI) is enabled. The command StrtCmdMd must be sent to switch to Command
    Mode for further command processing (SENT output must be overwritten by the OWI master).
 The ZSSC4175D-01 returns to Normal Operation Mode including SENT transmission of valid thermocouple signals if fault checks do not
    detect continuation of fault conditions.

                                                                                                                            ZSSC4175D-01 Datasheet
The fault confirmation of the ZSSC4175D-01 is defined as follows:
 Fault confirmation is only processed for fault checks assigned to the Temporary DM.
 Fault confirmation is a low-pass filter that delays the activation and deactivation of the Temporary DM.
 In the event of a fault detection, faults are re-checked before entering Temporary DM.
 In the case of Temporary DM, detected fault conditions that no longer exist are re-checked before returning from Temporary DM to NOM.
 Fault confirmation is an up-and-down event counter that allows confirmation of a failure event.
8.2        Fault Messaging
8.2.1       Overview
The SENT offers three options for fault messaging:
 Fault codes in the data channels (the Fast Channels as well as the SDM Channels; e.g., the channel used for temperature)
 Two status bits in the SENT status nibble
 SDM Channel status word
8.2.2       SENT Fast Channel Fault Codes
For the 12-bit SENT Fast Channel, the output value interval [4089, 4095] is reserved for fault codes. This is according to the SENT standard.
In addition, the value 0 is used for signal initialization (no valid data available).
In the ZSSC4175D-01, the SENT Fast Channel fault codes are selectable, and a dedicated fault code must be assigned to every supervised
fault. A fault prioritization is available, and in the event of simultaneous detection of multiple faults, the fault code of the highest prioritized fault
is transmitted.
8.2.3       SENT Status Bits
According to the SENT standard, the SENT status nibble contains two bits for status information. The assignment of the status bits to the
individual detectable faults is configurable.
8.2.4       SENT SDM Channel Status Codes
The SENT standard defines a SMD Channel status word assigned to the SDM identifier #01.
In the ZSSC4175D-01, the SENT SMD Channel status codes are freely programmable, and a dedicated fault code must be assigned to every
supervised fault. A fault prioritization is available, and in the event of simultaneous detection of multiple faults, the status code of the highest
prioritized fault is transmitted. See section 7.6.3 for details.
8.2.5       Timing Definitions
The timing for the update of the SENT output and for the fault messaging is defined in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The relevant timing parameters
are listed in Table 12.

9. Fault Checks
9.1      Overview
The ZSSC4175D-01 supports several fault checks that can be evaluated on the application system level to enable fault tolerant operation.
These fault checks are supported by three types of monitors:
 Firmware Monitors: implemented in the hardware and firmware of the ZSSC4175D-01.
 Application Monitors: defined by the 4175_0500_01 configuration. These monitors primarily check values for a certain range.
 Transmission Monitors: not implemented by the ZSSC4175D-01 but by the receiver of the conditioned signal data (ECU).
The tables below list the monitors for the supported fault checks.

9.3                   Application Monitors
The ZSSC4175D-01 provides several fault checks mainly based on the monitoring of a physical value. A fault is detected if the measurement
value exceeds or falls below a given threshold. For every measurement, there is a certain transfer characteristic from the monitored physical
value to the measurement value. The reverse function maps a threshold to a specific physical value. Because of the part-dependent
measurement tolerance, a defined threshold spreads out over a certain range determined by a lower value and an upper value. The range limits
are defined using A, B, C, and D references in Table 14 and Figure 7. A fault is securely detected if the physical value falls below the lower
value (A) coming from the lower threshold, or if it exceeds the upper value (D) coming from the upper threshold. Otherwise it is ensured that no
fault is messaged if the physical value is in the range between the upper value (B) coming from the lower threshold and the lower value (C)
coming from the upper threshold.

                      A                            If the physical value is below this measured value, the fault is securely detected and messaged.
                      B                            If the physical value is above this measured value, a non-fault state is securely detected.
                      C                            If the physical value is below this measured value, a non-fault state is securely detected.
                      D                            If the physical value is above this measured value, the fault is securely detected and messaged.

Note that there are multiple application monitors as defined in Table 15. Some have thresholds predefined by IDT. Others can have custom
thresholds. All monitors require a correctly programmed and calibrated configuration to ensure the correct fault check operation.
