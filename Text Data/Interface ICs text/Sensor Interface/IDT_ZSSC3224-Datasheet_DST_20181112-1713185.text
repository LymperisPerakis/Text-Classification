2.       Absolute Maximum Ratings
Note: The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The ZSSC3224 might not function or be operable above the recommended
operating conditions. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also damage the device. In addition, extended exposure to
stresses above the recommended operating conditions might affect device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute
Maximum Ratings.”

  [a] Power supply rejection is reduced if a current in the range of 16.5mA > IVDDB > 1.8mA is drawn out of VDDB.
A dynamic power-on-reset circuit is implemented in order to achieve minimum current consumption in Sleep Mode. The VDD low level and the
subsequent rise time and VDD rising slope must meet the requirements in Table 3.2 to guarantee an overall IC reset; lower VDD low levels
allow slower rising of the subsequent on-ramp of VDD. Other combinations might also be possible. For example, the reset trigger can be
influenced by increasing the power-down time and lowering the VDD rising slope requirement. Alternatively, the RES pin can be connected and
used to control safe resetting of the ZSSC3224. RES is active-low; a VDD-VSS-VDD transition at the RES pin leads to a complete ZSSC3224
reset.

5. Circuit Description
5.1      Brief Description
The ZSSC3224 provides a highly accurate amplification of bridge sensor signals. The compensation of sensor offset, sensitivity, temperature
drift, and non-linearity is accomplished via a 26-bit DSP core running a correction algorithm with calibration coefficients stored in a non-volatile
memory. The ZSSC3224 can be configured for a wide range of resistive bridge sensor types and for absolute voltage source sensors. A digital
interface (SPI or I2C) enables communication. The ZSSC3224 supports two operational modes: Normal Mode and Command Mode. Normal
Mode is the standard operating mode. Typically in Normal Mode, the ZSSC3224 wakes up from Sleep Mode (low power), runs a measurement
in Active State, and automatically returns to the Sleep Mode. (See section 6.4 for details on operational modes.)
5.2      Signal Flow and Block Diagram
See Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2 for the ZSSC3224 block diagram for different input sensors. The sensor bridge supply VDDB and the power supply
for analog circuitry are provided by a voltage regulator, which is optimized for power supply disturbance rejection (PSRR). See section 4.1 for
a graph of PSRR versus frequency. To improve noise suppression, the digital blocks are powered by a separate voltage regulator. A power
supervision circuit monitors all supply voltages and generates appropriate reset signals for initializing the digital blocks.
The System Control Unit controls the analog circuitry to perform the three measurement types: external sensor, temperature, and offset
measurement. The multiplexer selects the signal input to the amplifier, which can be the external signals from the input pins INP and INN or the
internal temperature reference sensor signals. A full measurement request will trigger an automatic sequence of all measurement types and all
input signals.

The amplifier consists of two stages with programmable gain values.
The ZSSC3224 employs a programmable analog-to-digital converter (ADC) optimized for conversion speed and noise suppression. The
programmable resolution from 12 to 24 bits provides flexibility for adapting the conversion characteristics. To improve power supply noise
suppression, the ADC uses the bridge supply VDDB as its reference voltage leading to a ratiometric measurement topology if the external sensor
is a bridge-type element.
The remaining ZSSC3224-internal offset and the sensor element offset, i.e., the overall system offset for the amplifier and ADC, can be canceled
by means of an offset and auto-zero measurement, respectively.
The DSP accomplishes the auto-zero, span, and 1st and 2nd order temperature compensation of the measured external sensor signal. The
correction coefficients are stored in the MTP memory.
The ZSSC3224 supports SPI and I2C interface communication for controlling the ZSSC3224, configuration, and measurement result output.
5.3         Analog Front End
5.3.1 Amplifier
The amplifier has a fully differential architecture and consists of two stages. The amplification of each stage and the external sensor gain polarity
are programmable via settings in the Measurement Configuration Register SM_config1 and SM_config2 (addresses 12HEX and 16HEX; see
section 6.6.2) in the MTP memory (for details, see section 5.4.2).
Note: Only one of these two possible configurations is used for the measurement. The default configuration is SM_config1. Alternately,
SM_config2 can be implemented by sending a command to select this configuration for the measurement (see section 6.5.1). The term
SM_config is used in explanations for general register content and functionality for both SM_config1 and SM_config2, as the registers’ bit
assignments are exactly the same for both registers.
The first 6 bits of SM_config are the programmable gain settings Gain_stage1 and Gain_stage2. The options for the programmable gain settings
are listed in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2.

If needed, the polarity of the sensor bridge gain can be reversed by setting the Gain_polarity bit, which is bit 6 in the SM_config register (see
section 6.6.2). Changing the gain polarity is achieved by inverting the chopper clock. Table 5.3 gives the settings for the Gain_polarity bit. This
feature enables applying a sensor to the ZSSC3224 with swapped input signals at INN and INP; e.g., to avoid crossing wires for the final sensor
module’s assembly.

5.3.2 Analog-to-Digital Converter
An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to digitize the amplifier signal. To allow optimizing the trade-off between conversion time and
resolution, the resolution can be programmed in a range from 12-bit to 24-bit (Adc_bits bit field in the SM_config register; section 6.6.2). The
ADC processes differential input signals.

The ADC can perform an offset shift in order to adapt input signals with offsets to the ADC input range. The shift feature is enabled by setting
the SM_config register’s bit 15 = 1 (Shift_method = 1). The respective analog offset shift can be set up with bits [14:12], the Offset bit field in
SM_config. The offset shift causes the ADC to perform an additional amplification of the ADC’s input signal by a factor of 2. This must be taken
into consideration for a correct analog sensor setup via configuration of the pre-amplifier’s gain, the ADC offset shift, and the potential ADC
gain.
The overall analog amplification Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ GainADC can be determined for the following options:
If no offset shift is selected, i.e., Shift_method = 0 and Offset = 000 in SM_config,
           Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ 1
If ADC offset shift is selected, i.e., Shift_method = 1 and Offset  000 in SM_config,
           Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ 2

Important note: If the required configuration is no offset shift and no additional gain factor (and therefore GainADC = 1), then the only valid
settings are Shift_method = 0 and Offset = 000 in SM_config. Any other setup using Shift_method = 0 combined with Offset ≠ 000 leads to
erroneous analog setups.
The setting for ADC resolution for the external sensor (bridge or voltage-source sensor) affects the typical measurement duration and noise
performance as shown in Table 5.6 for the example of a bridge sensor measurement using the “Measure” command (AAHEX; see section 6.4.1).

5.3.3 Selection of Gain and Offset – Sensor System Dimensioning
The optimal gain (and offset) setup for a specific sensor element can be determined by the following steps:
    1.   Collect sensor element’s characteristic, statistical data (over temperature, ambient sensor parameter, and over production
         tolerances):
         a.   Minimum differential output voltage: Vmin
         b.   Maximum differential output voltage: Vmax
         Note: The best possible setup can only be determined if the absolute value of Vmax is larger than the absolute value of Vmin. If this is
         not the case, the gain polarity should be reversed by means of the Gain_polarity bit in the MTP’s SM_config register.
    2.   Calculate:
         a.   Common mode level; i.e., differential offset of the sensor output: VCM = 0.5 ∗ (Vmax + Vmin )
                                                                                              VCM
         b.   Relative or percentage offset of the sensor output: Offsetsensor [%] =                   ∗ 100%
                                                                                           Vmax – Vmin
    3.   Determine which of the two following cases is valid:
         a.   If Offsetsensor[%] > 43% then select Offset = 111 (i.e., 43.25%)
         b.   If 0% < Offsetsensor[%] ≤ 43% then select Offset ≤ Offsetsensor[%]
              (see Table 5.5 for possible ADC Offset setup values)
    4.   The totally required, optimum gain can be determined as
                                               1.4V
                    Gaintotal, opt =              Offsetsensor
                                      Vmax ∗ (1 –              )
                                                      100
         Configure gain factors in the following step such that Gaintotal ≤ Gaintotal,opt (see section 5.3.1).
    5.   The gain setup can be separated into the three factors Gainamp1, Gainamp2 (for the 2-stage amplifier), and GainADC (1 for no shift or 2
         for shift operation) according to
                    Gaintotal = Gainamp1 ∗ Gainamp2 ∗ GainADC .
         a.   If no offset shift is performed (Shift_method = 0 and Offset = 000), the amplifier gain is Gaintotal
         b.   If an offset shift is performed (Shift_method = 1), the amplifier gain is 0.5 ∗ Gaintotal

5.3.4 Temperature Measurement
The ZSSC3224 provides an internal temperature sensor measurement to allow compensation for temperature effects. See section 4 for the
temperature sensor resolution. The temperature output signal is a differential voltage that is adapted by the amplifier for the ADC input.
For temperature measurements, the respective settings are defined and programmed in the MTP by IDT.
5.3.5 External Sensor Supply: Bridge Sensors
The ZSSC3224 provides dedicated supply pins VDDB and VSSB for resistive bridge-type sensors (AbsV_enable bit 11 = 0 in SM_config, MTP
registers 12HEX or 16HEX). The ADC reference voltages for the sensor bridge measurement are derived from these internal voltages such that
bridge supply disturbances are suppressed. The current drive ability of VDDB is limited (see IVDDB in section 3).
5.3.6 External Sensor: Absolute Voltage Source Sensors
Alternatively, the ZSSC3224 can process signals from an absolute-voltage source sensor; e.g., a thermopile element. The respective input-
type selection can be done with the AbsV_enable bit 11 =1 in SM_config, MTP registers 12HEX or 16HEX. The respective sensor element must
be connected between the INP and INN pins; INN is internally connected to the ZSSC3224’s analog ground (important: this is not VSSB). Do
not connect VDDB and VSSB if an absolute-voltage source sensor is applied. The offset shift should be set to maximum in this case,
Shift_method = 1 and Offset = 111 in SM_config. The required gain can be determined according to the procedure described in section 5.3.3.

5.4         Digital Section
5.4.1 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Core
The “DSP Core” block performs the algorithm for correcting the sensor signal. The required coefficients are stored in the MTP memory.
When the measurement results are available, the “end of conversion” signal is set at the EOC pin if no interrupt-threshold has been set up
(bits[8:7] = 00 in memory register 02HEX). The internal EOC information is valid only if both the measurement and calculation have been
completed. Alternatively, the EOC pin can indicate exceeding or underrunning of a certain threshold or leaving a valid-result range as described
in section 6.3.
5.4.2 MTP Memory
The ZSSC3224’s memory is designed with a true multiple time programmable (MTP) structure. The memory is organized in 16-bit registers that
can be re-written multiple times (at least 1000). The user has access to a 57  16-bit storage area for values such as calibration coefficients.
The required programming voltage is generated internally in the ZSSC3224. A checksum of the entire memory is evaluated be for integrity-
check purposes. The checksum can be generated with the command 90HEX (see section 6.4.1).
5.4.3 Clock Generator
The clock generator provides approximately 4MHz and 1MHz clock signals as the time base for ZSSC3224-internal signal processing. The
frequency is trimmed during production test.
5.4.4 Power Supervision
The power supervision block, which is a part of the voltage regulator combined with the digital section, monitors all power supplies to ensure a
defined reset of all digital blocks during power-up or power supply interruptions. “Brown-out” cases at the supply that do not meet the power-on
reset (POR) requirements (see Table 3.2), must be resolved with a reset pulse at the RES pin.
5.4.5 Interface
The ZSSC3224 can communicate with the user’s communication master or computer via an SPI or I2C interface. The interface type is selectable
with the first activity at the interface after power-up or reset:
 If the first command is an I2C command and the SS pin has been inactive until receiving this command, the ZSSC3224 enters I2C Mode.
 If the first interface action is the SS pin being set to active (HIGH-active or LOW-active depending on the SS_polarity bit[9] in memory
     interface register 02HEX), then the ZSSC3224 enters SPI Mode.
During the initiation sequence (after power-up or reset), any potential transition on SS is ignored. Switching to the SPI Mode is only possible
after the power-up sequence. If SS is not connected, the SS pin internal pull-up keeps the ZSSC3224 in I2C Mode.
To also provide interface accessibility in Sleep Mode (all features inactive except for the digital interface logic), the interface circuitry is directly
supplied by VDD.

6.       Functional Description
6.1        Power Up
Specifications for this section are given in sections 3 and 4. On power-up, the ZSSC3224 communication interface is able to receive the first
command after a time tSTA1 from when the VDD supply is within operating specifications. The ZSSC3224 can begin the first measurement after
a time of tSTA2, from when the VDD supply is operational. Alternatively, instead of a power-on reset, a reset and new power-up sequence can
be triggered by an IC-reset signal (high low) at the RES pin.
The wake up time from Sleep Mode to Active State (see section 6.4) after receiving the activating command is defined as tWUP1 and tWUP2. In
Command Mode, subsequent commands can be sent after tWUP1. The first measurement starts after tWUP2 if a measurement request was sent.
6.2        Measurements
Available measurement procedures are
 AZSM: auto-zero (external) sensor measurement
 SM: (external) sensor measurement
 AZTM: auto-zero temperature measurement
 TM: temperature measurement
AZSM: The configuration is loaded for measuring the external sensor; i.e., a resistive bridge or an absolute voltage source. The “Multiplexer”
block connects the amplifier input to the AGND analog ground reference. An analog-to-digital (A2D) conversion is performed so that the inherent
system offset for the configuration is converted by the ADC to a digital word with a resolution according to the respective MTP configuration.
SM: The configuration is loaded for measuring the external sensor; i.e., a resistive bridge or an absolute voltage source. The “Multiplexer” block
connects the amplifier input to the INP and INN pins. An A2D conversion is performed. The result is a digital word with a resolution according
to the MTP configuration.
AZTM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The “Multiplexer” block connects the amplifier input to AGND. An analog-
to-digital conversion is performed so that the inherent system offset for the temperature configuration is converted by the ADC with a resolution
according to the respective MTP configuration.
TM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The “Multiplexer” block connects the amplifier input to the internal temperature
sensor. An A2D conversion is performed. The result is a digital word with a resolution according to the MTP configuration.
The typical application’s measurement cycle is a complete SSC measurement (using one of the commands AAHEX to AFHEX; see section 6.4.1)
with AZSM, SM, AZTM, and TM followed by a signal correction calculation.
6.3        Interrupt (EOC Pin)
The EOC pin can be programmed to operate either as a pure “measurement busy” and end-of-conversion (EOC) indicator or as a configurable
interrupt indicator. The basic operation must be programmed to the INT_setup bits [8:7] in register 02HEX (see Table 6.5). One or two 24-bit-
quantized thresholds can be programmed (TRSH1 and TRSH2 in memory registers 13HEX, 14HEX, and 15HEX).
The thresholds are programmed left-aligned in the memory; i.e., they must be programmed with the threshold’s MSB in the memory register’s
MSB, etc. The number of LSB threshold bits that are used is equal to the number of bits for the selected ADC resolution (determined by the
Adc_bits field in registers 12HEX and 16HEX); unused LSB bits are ignored.
The interrupt functionality is only available for digital values from the SSC-calculation unit (i.e., after sensor signal conditioning); raw values
cannot be monitored by the interrupt feature. Figure 6.1 shows the different setup options and the respective response at the EOC pin. The use
of the interrupt functionality is recommended for cyclic operation (command ABHEX with the respective power-down setup in the Interface
Configuration memory register 02HEX). The EOC level continuously represents the respective SSC-measurement results only during cyclic
operation. For single or oversample measurement requests without cyclic operation, the EOC output signal is reset to logical zero at the
beginning of each new measurement, even though the interrupt thresholds are established correctly at the end of each measurement (setting
EOC to logical one or zero is dependent on the interrupt setup).

6.4          Operational Modes
Figure 6.2 illustrates the ZSSC3224 power-up sequence and subsequent operation depending on the selected interface communication mode
(I2C or SPI) as determined by interface-related first activities after power-up or reset. If the first command after power-up is a valid I2C command,
the interface will function as an I2C interface until the next power-on reset (POR). If there is no valid I2C command, but an active signal at the
SS pin is detected as the first valid activity, then the interface will respond as an SPI slave. With either interface, after the voltage regulators
are switched on, the ZSSC3224’s low-voltage section (LV) is active while the related interface configuration information is read from memory.
Then the LV section is switched off, the ZSSC3224 goes into Sleep Mode, and the interface is ready to receive commands. The interface is
always powered by VDD, so it is referred to as the high voltage section (HV).
See Table 6.1 for definitions of the commands.

Figure 6.3 shows the ZSSC3224 operation in Normal Mode (with two operation principles: “Sleep” and “Cyclic”) and Command Mode, including
when the LV and HV sections are active as indicated by the color legend. The Normal Mode automatically returns to Sleep Mode after executing
the requested measurements, or periodically wakes up and conducts another measurement according to the setting for the sleep duration
configured by CYC_period (bits[14:12] in memory register 02HEX). In Command Mode, the ZSSC3224 remains active if a dedicated command
(e.g., Start_NOM) is sent, which is helpful during calibration. Command Mode can only be entered if Start_CM (command A9HEX; see Table
6.1) is the first command received after a POR.

6.4.1 SPI/I2C Commands
The SPI/I2C commands supported by the ZSSC3224 are listed in Table 6.1. The command to read an address in the user memory is the same
as its address. The command to write to an address in user memory is the address plus 40HEX.
There is an IDT-reserved section of memory that can be read but not over-written by the user.

6.5       Communication Interface
6.5.1 Common Functionality
Commands are handled by the command interpreter in the LV section. Commands that need additional data are not treated differently than
other commands because the HV interface is able to buffer the command and all the data that belongs to the command and the command
interpreter is activated as soon as a command byte is received.
Every response starts with a status byte followed by the data word. The data word depends on the previous command. It is possible to read the
same data more than once if the read request is repeated (I2C) or a NOP command is sent (SPI). If the next command is not a read request
(I2C) or a NOP (SPI), it invalidates any previous data.
The ZSSC3224 supports the parallel setup of two amplifier-ADC-configurations using SM_config1 (default) and SM_config2. Switching between
the two setups can be done with the commands B0HEX (selects SM_config1) and B1HEX (selects SM_config2). Note that the respective activation
command must always be sent prior to the measurement request.

The status byte contains the following bits in the sequence shown in Table 6.3:
 Power indication (bit 6): 1 if the device is powered (VDDB on); 0 if not powered. This is needed for the SPI Mode where the master reads all
     zeroes if the device is not powered or in power-on reset (POR).
 Busy indication (bit 5): 1 if the device is busy, which indicates that the data for the last command is not available yet. No new commands
     are processed if the device is busy.
     Note: The device is always busy if the cyclic measurement operation has been set up and started.
 Currently active ZSSC3224 mode (bits [4:3]): 00 = Normal Mode; 01 = Command Mode; 1X = IDT reserved.
 Memory integrity/error flag (bit 2): 0 if integrity test passed; 1 if test failed. This bit indicates whether the checksum-based integrity check
     passed or failed. The memory error status bit is calculated only during the power-up sequence, so a newly written CRC will only be used
     for memory verification and status update after a subsequent ZSSC3224 power-on reset (POR) or reset via the RES pin.
 Config Setup (bit 1): This bit indicates which SM_config register is being used for the active configuration: SM_config1 (12HEX) or
     SM_config2 (16HEX). The two alternate configuration setups allow for two different configurations of the external sensor channel in order to
     support up to two application scenarios with the use of only one sensor-ZSSC3224 pair. This bit is 0 if SM_config1 was selected (default).
     This bit is 1 if SM_config2 was selected.
 ALU saturation (bit 0): If the last command was a measurement request, this bit is 0 if any intermediate value and the final SSC result are
     in a valid range and no SSC-calculation internal saturation occurred in the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). If the last command was a
     measurement request, this bit is 1 if an SSC-calculation internal saturation occurred. This bit is also 0 for any non-measurement
     command.

Further status information can be provided by the EOC pin. The EOC pin is set high when a measurement and calculation have been completed
(if no interrupt threshold is used, i.e. INT_setup==00BIN; see section 6.3).
6.5.2 SPI
The SPI Mode is available if the first interface activity after the ZSSC3224 power-up is an active signal at the SS pin. The polarity and phase of
the SPI clock are programmable via the CKP_CKE setting in bits [11:10] in address 02HEX as described in Table 6.5. CKP_CKE is two bits:
CPHA (bit 10), which selects which edge of SCLK latches data, and CPOL (bit 11), which indicates whether SCLK is high or low when it is idle.
The polarity of the SS signal and pin are programmable via the SS_polarity setting (bit 9). The different combinations of polarity and phase are
illustrated in the figures below.

In SPI mode, each command except NOP is started as shown in Figure 6.6. After the execution of a command (busy = 0), the expected data
can be read as illustrated in Figure 6.7 or if no data are returned by the command, the next command can be sent. The status can be read at
any time with the NOP command (see Figure 6.8).

I2C Mode will be selected if the very first interface activity after ZSSC3224 power-up is an I2C command. In I2C Mode, each command is
started as shown in Figure 6.9. Only the number of bytes that are needed for the command must be sent. An exception is the I2C High Speed
Mode (see Slave_Addr in Table 6.5) for which 3 bytes must always be sent as in SPI Mode. After the execution of a command (busy = 0), the
expected data can be read as illustrated in Figure 6.11 or if no data are returned by the command, the next command can be sent. The status
can be read at any time as illustrated in Figure 6.10.

                                                                                                                       ZSSC3224 Datasheet
All mandatory I2C-bus protocol features are implemented. Optional protocol features such as clock stretching, 10-bit slave address, etc., are
not supported by the ZSSC3224’s interface.
In I2C-High-Speed Mode, a command consists of a fixed length of three bytes.
6.6       Multiple Time Programmable (MTP) Memory
In the ZSSC3224, the memory is organized in 16-bit registers and can be programmed multiple times (at least 1000). There are 57 x 16-bit
registers available for customer use. Each register can be re-programmed. Basically, there are two MTP content sectors:
 Customer use: accessible by means of regular write operations: 40HEX to 79HEX. It contains the customer ID, interface setup data,
     measurement setup information, calibration coefficients, etc.
 IDT use: only accessible for write operations by IDT. The IDT sector contains specific trim information and is programmed during
     manufacturing test by IDT.
6.6.1 Programming Memory
Programming memory is possible with any specified supply voltage level at VDD. The MTP programming voltage itself is generated by means
of an integrated charge pump, generating an internal memory programming voltage; no additional, external voltage, other than VDD (as

The memory integrity checksum (referred to as CRC) is generated through a linear feedback shift register with the following polynomial:
        g(x) = x16 + x15 + x2 + 1        with the initialization value: FFFFHEX.
If the CRC is valid, then the “Memory Error” status bit is set to 0.
6.7        Calibration Sequence
Calibration essentially involves collecting raw signal and temperature data from the sensor-ZSSC3224 system for different known sensor-
element values (i.e., for a resistive bridge or an absolute voltage source) and temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the
calibration master (assumed to be the user’s computer), and the calculated calibration coefficients can then be written to on-chip memory.
Here is a brief overview of the three main steps involved in calibrating the ZSSC3224.
Assigning a unique identification to the ZSSC3224. This identification is written to shadow RAM and programmed in MTP memory. This unique
identification can be stored in the two 16-bit registers dedicated to the customer ID (00HEX and 01HEX; see Table 6.5). It can be used as an index
into a database stored on the calibration PC. This database will contain all the raw values of the connected sensor-element readings and
temperature readings for that part, as well as the known sensor-element measurand conditions and temperature to which the sensor-element
was exposed.
Data collection. Data collection involves getting uncorrected (raw) data from the external sensor at different known measurand values and
temperatures. Then this data is stored on the calibration master using the unique identification of the device as the index to the database.
Coefficient calculation and storage in MTP memory. After enough data points have been collected to calculate all the desired coefficients, the
coefficients can be calculated by the calibration master. Then the coefficients can be programmed to the MTP memory.
Result. The sensor signal and the characteristic temperature effect on output will be linearized according to the setup-dependent maximum
output range.
It is essential to perform the calibration with a fixed programming setup during the data collection phase. In order to prevent any accidental
incorrect processing, it is further recommended that the MTP memory setup is kept stable during the entire calibration process as well as in the
subsequent operation. A ZSSC3224 calibration only fits the setup used during its calibration. Changes in functional parameters after a
successful calibration can decrease the precision and accuracy performance of the ZSSC3224 as well as of the entire application.
The ZSSC3224 supports operation with different sensor setups by means of the SM_config1 and SM_config2 registers. However, only one
calibration coefficient set is supported. Therefore, either an alternative ZSSC3224-external signal calibration using the alternate SM_config
settings must be performed to ensure that the programmed SSC coefficients are valid for both setups, or a full reprogramming of the SSC
coefficients must be performed each time the sensor setup is changed. The selection of the external sensor setup (i.e., the AFE configuration)
can be done with the interface commands B0HEX and B1HEX (see Table 6.1).
6.7.1 Calibration Step 1 – Assigning Unique Identification
Assign a unique identification number to the ZSSC3224 by using the memory write command (40HEX + data and 41HEX + data; see Table 6.1
and Table 6.5) to write the identification number to Cust_ID0 at memory address 00HEX and Cust_ID1 at address 01HEX as described in section
6.6.1. These two 16-bit registers allow for more than 4 billion unique devices.
6.7.2 Calibration Step 2 – Data Collection
The number of unique points (measurand and/or temperature) at which calibration must be performed generally depends on the requirements
of the application and the behavior of the sensor in use. The minimum number of points required is equal to the number of correction coefficients
to be corrected with a minimum of three different temperatures at three different sensor values. For a full calibration resulting in values for all 7
possible (external) sensor coefficients and 3 possible temperature coefficients, a minimum of 7 pairs of sensor with temperature measurements
must be collected.

                                                                                                                            ZSSC3224 Datasheet
Within this minimum field of 3 measurand measurements x 3 temperature measurements, data must be collected for the specific value pairs (at
known conditions) and then processed to calculate the coefficients. In order to obtain the potentially best and most robust coefficients, it is
recommended that measurement pairs (temperature versus measurand) be collected at the outer corners of the intended operation range or at
least at points that are located far from each other. It is also essential to provide highly precise reference values as nominal, expected values.
The measurement precision of the external calibration-measurement equipment should be ten times more accurate than the expected
ZSSC3224 output accuracy after calibration in order to avoid accuracy losses caused by the nominal reference values (e.g., measurand signal
and temperature deviations).
Note: The coefficients SENS_shift and T_shift must not be determined during this calibration step.
Strong recommendation: Set these coefficients to zero until after initial calibration.
Note: An appropriate selection of measurement pairs can significantly improve the overall system performance.
The determination of the measurand-related coefficients will use all of the measurement pairs. For the temperature-related correction
coefficients, 3 of the measurement pairs (at three different temperatures) will be used.
Note: There is an inherent redundancy in the 7 sensor-related and 3 temperature-related coefficients. Since the temperature is a necessary
output (which also needs correction), the temperature-related information is mathematically separated, which supports faster and more efficient
DSP calculations during the normal usage of the sensor-ZSSC3224 system. The recommended approach for data collection is to make use of
the raw-measurement commands described in Table 6.2.
For external sensor values, either of the following commands can be used depending on the user’s requirements:
 A2HEX + 0000HEX           Single sensor measurement for which the configuration register will be loaded from the SM_config1 register (12HEX in
     MTP); preprogramming the measurement setup in the MTP is required.
     Note: SM_config1 is the default configuration. Alternatively, SM_config2 (16HEX in MTP) can be used by first sending the command B1HEX
     (see section 6.7.5).
 A3HEX + ssssHEX           Single sensor measurement for which the SM_config configuration register (Gain, ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded
     as the user’s configuration ssssHEX, which must be provided externally via the interface as the data part of this command.
For temperature values, either of the following commands can be used depending on the user’s requirements:
 A6HEX + 0000HEX           Single temperature measurement for which the configuration register will be loaded from an internal temperature
     configuration register (preprogrammed by IDT in the MTP); preprogramming of the respective configuration is done by IDT prior to
     ZSSC3224 delivery. This is the recommended approach for temperature data collection.
 A7HEX + ssssHEX           Single temperature measurement for which the configuration register (Gain, ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded as the
     user’s configuration ssssHEX, which must be provided externally via the interface as the data part of this command. The format and
     purpose of these configuration bits must be according to the definitions for SM_config and valid for temperature measurement; in this
     case (bits [15:12] will be ignored).
6.7.3 Calibration Step 3a) – Coefficient Calculations
The math to perform the coefficient calculation is complicated and will not be discussed in detail. There is a brief overview in the next section.
IDT provides software (DLLs) to perform the coefficient calculation (external to the sensor-ZSSC3224 system) based on auto-zero corrected
values. After the coefficients are calculated, the final step is to write them to the MTP memory of the ZSSC3224.
6.7.4 Calibration Step 3b) – Post-Calibration Offset Correction
There are two special SSC coefficients, SENS_shift and T_shift. Normally, these coefficients must be set to zero during the initial sensor
calibration. The primary purpose of these two coefficients is to cancel additional offset shifts that could occur during or after final sensor
assembly; e.g. if a respective sensor is finally placed and soldered on an application board.
If the final sensor assembly induced any kind of offset (on either the temperature or external sensor signal), the respective influence can be
directly compensated by means of the SENS_shift and T_shift coefficients without the need to change the original SSC coefficient set. However,
this post-calibration offset correction must be done under known ambient conditions (i.e., sensor measurand and/or temperature).

                                                                                                                            ZSSC3224 Datasheet
6.7.5 SSC Measurements
After the completion of the calibration procedure, linearized external sensor and temperature readings can be obtained using the commands
AAHEX to AFHEX as described in Table 6.1.
Typically, only one external sensor is used in a single analog configuration using the setup in the SM_config1 MTP register (12HEX). However,
the ZSSC3224 can support a second analog configuration that is set up in the SM_config2 MTP register (16HEX). This might be useful in cases
where only one sensor-ZSSC3224 pair must support the measurand ranges for two different external sensors that have different precisions,
required amplification, and sensor offset.
If a respective switching between setups is to be performed, the SSC coefficients for the alternate external sensor must be handled with one of
the following methods:
 The programmed SSC coefficients are not used for the alternate external sensor. The ZSSC3224 performs only a one-to-one transfer, i.e.
     no effective digital SSC correction – only a transfer of the auto-zero corrected raw ADC readings to the ZSSC3224 output without any
     scaling, etc.
 The coefficients are re-programmed each time the analog setup is changed.
SM_config1 is selected as the analog setup register by default, so no specific activation is needed if only SM_config1 is used. If SM_config2
will also be used, the activation command B1HEX must be sent once prior to the measurement request. To switch to using SM_config1, the
activation command B0HEX must be sent prior to use. This activation must be refreshed after any power-on reset or RES pin reset.
6.8        The Calibration Math
6.8.1 Bridge Signal Compensation
The saturation check in the ZSSC3224 detects saturation effects of the internal calculation steps, allowing the final correction output to be
determined despite the saturation. It is possible to get potentially useful signal conditioning results that have had an intermediate saturation
during the calculations. These cases are detectable by observing the status bit 0 for each measurement result. Details about the saturation
limits and the valid ranges for values are provided in the following equations.
The calibration math description assumes a calculation with integer numbers. The description is numerically correct concerning values, dynamic
range, and resolution.
SOT_curve selects whether second-order equations compensate for sensor nonlinearity with a parabolic or S-shaped curve. The parabolic
compensation is recommended for most sensor types.
For the following equations, the terms are as follows:

6.8.2 Temperature Signal Compensation
Temperature is measured internally. Temperature correction contains both linear gain and offset terms as well as a second-order term to correct
for any nonlinearities. For temperature, second-order compensation for nonlinearity is always parabolic.
For the following equations, the terms are as follows:
      T                =      Corrected temperature sensor reading output via I2C or SPI; range [0HEX to FFFFFFHEX]
      Gain_T           =      Gain coefficient for temperature; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
      T_Raw            =      Raw temperature reading after AZ correction; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
      Offset_T         =      Offset coefficient for temperature; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
      SOT_T            =      Second-order term for temperature source non-linearity; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
      T_Shift          =      Shift for post-calibration/post-assembly offset compensation; range [-7FFFFFHEX to 7FFFFFHEX]
The correction formula is best represented as a two-step process as follows:
