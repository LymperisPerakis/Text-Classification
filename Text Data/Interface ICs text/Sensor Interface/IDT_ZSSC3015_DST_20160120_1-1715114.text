1         Electrical Characteristics
1.1.           Absolute Maximum Ratings
The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The ZSSC3015 might not function or be operable above
the recommended operating conditions. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also damage
the device. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions might affect
device reliability. IDT does not recommend designing to the “Absolute Maximum Ratings.”

    Only needed for Analog Output Mode; not needed for Digital Output Mode. When a pull-down resistor is used as load resistor, the power loss detection
    diagnostic for loss of VSS cannot be assured at RL=5k; RL=10k is recommended for this configuration.
 4)
    Using the output for digital calibration, CL,OUT is limited by the maximum rise time tZAC,rise. See section 1.3.
    Note: Minimum bridge resistance is only a factor if using the Bsink feature. The RDS(ON) of the Bsink transistor is 8 to 10Ω when operating at VDD=5V. This
 5)
    gives rise to a ratiometricity inaccuracy that becomes greater with low bridge resistances.
    Note: Minimum bridge resistance is important if using certain diagnostic features. It must be at least 0.3kΩ at VDD=2.7V and at least 0.6kΩ at VDD=5V for the

1.4.          Analog Inputs versus Output Resolution
The ZSSC3015 has a fully differential chopper-stabilized pre-amplifier with 4 programmable gain settings. The
output of the pre-amplifier is input to a 14-bit charge-balanced ADC. Span, offset, temperature, and nonlinearity
correction are performed in the digital domain. Then the resulting corrected bridge value can be output in analog
form through a 12-bit DAC or as a 16-bit serial digital packet. The resolution of the output depends on the input
span (bridge sensitivity) and the analog gain setting programmed. Digital gains can vary from [0,32). Analog gains
available are 6, 24, 48, and 96.
Note: At higher analog gain settings, there will be higher output resolution, but the ability of the ZSSC3015 to
handle large offsets decreases. This is expected because the offset is also amplified by the analog gain and can
therefore saturate the ADC input.
The following tables outline the guaranteed minimum resolution for a given bridge sensitivity range.

2           Circuit Description
2.1.        Signal Flow and Block Diagram
The ZSSC3015 resistive bridge sensor interface ICs were specifically designed as cost-effective solutions for
sensing in building automation, automotive, industrial, office automation, and white goods applications. The
ZSSC3015 employs IDT’s high precision bandgap with proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) output; low-
power 14-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A2D, A-to-D); and an on-chip digital signal processor (DSP) core
with EEPROM to precisely calibrate the bridge output signal.
Three selectable outputs, two analog and one digital, offer the ultimate in versatility across many applications.
The ZSSC3015 rail-to-rail ratiometric analog Vout signal (0V to ~5 V Vout @ VDD=5V) suits most building automation
and automotive requirements (12-bit resolution). Typical office automation and white goods applications require
the 0 to ~1V Vout signal, which in the ZSSC3015 is referenced to the internal bandgap. The ZSSC3015 is capable
of running in high-voltage (5.5 to 30 V) systems when combined with an external JFET.
Direct interfacing to µP controllers is facilitated via IDT’s single-wire serial ZACwire™ digital interface.

2.2.1.      Bandgap/PTAT and PTAT Amplifier
The highly linear Bandgap/PTAT section provides the PTAT signal to the ADC, which allows accurate tempera-
ture conversion. In addition, the ultra-low ppm Bandgap section provides a stable voltage reference over
temperature for the operation of the rest of the ZSSC3015. If the bridge is not near the ZSSC3015, an external
diode can be used for temperature measurement/compensation.
The temperature signal (internal PTAT or external diode) is amplified through a path in the PREAMP block and
fed to the ADC for conversion. The most significant 12-bits of this converted result are used for temperature
measurement and temperature correction of bridge readings. When temperature is output in Digital Mode, only
the most significant 8 bits are given.
When external temperature is selected, add a diode from the ExtTemp pin to ground. The diode is biased with
approximately 50µA during temperature measurement cycles. The voltage level on ExtTemp is amplified through
the PREAMP section and converted by the ADC. Ensure that the ExtTemp signal is in the range of 150mV to
                                                                                                                o

3.25mV/ C, a corrected temperature output (in Digital Mode) can be achieved for a 200 C temperature span
     o         o
(-50 C to 150 C).
2.2.2.      Bridge Supply
The voltage-driven bridge is usually connected to VDD and ground. As a power savings feature, the ZSSC3015
also includes a switched transistor to interrupt the bridge current via pin 1 (Bsink). The transistor switching is
synchronized to the analog-to-digital conversion and released after finishing the conversion. To utilize this feature,
the low supply of the bridge should be connected to Bsink instead of ground.
Depending on the programmable update rate, the average current consumption (including bridge current) can be
reduced to approximately 20%, 5%, or 1%. Note this feature has no power savings benefit if using the fastest
update rate mode.
2.2.3.      PREAMP Block
The differential signal from the bridge is amplified through a chopper-stabilized instrumentation amplifier with very
high input impedance designed for low noise and low drift. This pre-amp provides gain for the differential signal
and re-centers its DC to VDD/2. The output of the PREAMP section is fed into the ADC. The calibration sequence
performed by the digital core includes an auto-zero sequence to null any drift in the pre-amp state over
temperature.
The pre-amp can be set to a gain of 6, 24, 48, or 96 through EEPROM. See Pamp_Gain in section 3.6.
The inputs to the pre-amp from (VBN/VBP pins) can be reversed via an EEPROM configuration bit. See “flip
polarity” under A2D_Offset in section 3.6.

                                                                                                   ZSSC3015 Datasheet
2.2.4.     Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
           nd
A 14-bit 2 order charge-balancing ADC is used to convert signals coming from the pre-amplifier. The converter,
designed in full differential switched capacitor technique, is used for converting the various signals in the digital
domain.
This principle offers the following advantages:
     •   High noise immunity because of the differential signal path and integrating behavior
     •   Independence from clock frequency drift and clock jitter
     •   Fast conversion time due to second order mode
Parameters of the ADC can be controlled with EEPROM settings given in section 3.6.
Four selectable values for the zero point of the input voltage allow conversion to adapt to the sensor’s offset
parameter. With the Flip Polarity Mode and the negative digital gain options, this results in seven possible zero
point adjustments (not eight because the -1/2,1/2 offset setting is the same regardless of gain polarity).
The conversion rate varies with the programmed update rate. The fastest conversation rate is 1k samples/s.
Based on a best fit, the integral nonlinearity (INL) is less than 4 LSB14Bit.
2.3.       Digital Signal Processor
A digital signal processor (DSP) is used for processing the converted bridge data as well as performing
temperature correction and computing the temperature value for output on the digital channel.
The digital core reads correction coefficients from EEPROM and can correct for the following:
    • Bridge Offset
    • Bridge Gain
    • Variation of Bridge Offset over Temperature (Tco)
    • Variation of Bridge Gain over Temperature (Tcg)
    • A single second-order effect (SOT) (Second Order Term)
The EEPROM contains a single SOT that can be applied to correct one and only one of the following:
        nd
    • 2 order behavior of bridge measurement
        nd
    • 2 order behavior of Tco
        nd
    • 2 order behavior of Tcg
If the SOT applies to correcting the bridge reading, then the correction formula for the bridge reading is
represented as a two-step process as follows:
        ZB = Gain _ B(1 + ∆T ∗ Tcg ) ∗ ( BR _ Raw − / + Offset _ B + ∆T ∗ Tco)                        (1)
        RB = ZB(1.25 + SOT ∗ ZB )                                                                     (2)
Where:
                                                                                              ™
         BR          =     Corrected Bridge reading that is output as digital or analog on Sig pin
         ZB          =     Intermediate result in the calculations

                                                                                                     ZSSC3015 Datasheet
         BR_Raw =          Raw Bridge reading from ADC
         T_Raw       =     Raw Temp reading converted from PTAT signal or external diode
         Gain_B      =     Bridge Gain term
         Offset_B =        Bridge Offset term
         Offset_B_sign = Sign bit for Bridge Offset term
         Tcg         =     Temperature Coefficient Gain
         Tco         =     Temperature Coefficient Offset
         ∆T          =     (T_Raw – TSETL)
         TSETL       =     T_Raw reading at which low calibration was performed (typically 25°C)
         SOT         =     Second Order Term
                                         nd
If the SOT applies to correcting the 2      order behavior of Tco, then the formula for bridge correction is as follows:
        BR = Gain _ B(1 + ∆T ∗ Tcg ) ∗ [ BR _ Raw − / + Offset _ B + ∆T ( SOT ∗ ∆T + Tco)]               (3)
                                         nd
If the SOT applies to correcting the 2      order behavior of Tcg, then the formula for bridge correction is as follows:
        BR = Gain _ B[1 + ∆T ( SOT ∗ ∆T + Tcg )] ∗ [ BR _ Raw − / + Offset _ B + ∆T ∗ Tco]               (4)
The bandgap reference gives a very linear PTAT signal, so temperature correction can always simply be
accomplished with a linear gain and offset term.
Corrected Temperature Reading:
        T = Gain _ T (T _ Raw + Offset _ T )                                                             (5)
Where:
         T_Raw       =   Raw Temperature reading converted from PTAT signal or external diode
         Offset_T =      Offset Coefficient for Temperature
         Gain_T      =   Gain Coefficient for Temperature
2.3.1.     EEPROM
The EEPROM contains the calibration coefficients for gain and offset, etc., and the configuration bits, such as
output mode, update rate, etc. The ZSSC3015 also offers 3 user-programmable storage bytes for module
traceability. When programming the EEPROM, an internal charge pump voltage is used; therefore a high voltage
supply is not needed. The EEPROM is implemented as a shift register. During an EEPROM read, the contents
are shifted 8 bits before each transmission of one byte occurs. The charge pump is internally regulated to 12.5 V,
and the programming time is 6ms.

                                                                                                     ZSSC3015 Datasheet
See section 2.6.1 regarding EEPROM signatures for verifying EEPROM integrity.
Note: EEPROM writing can only be performed at temperatures lower than 85ºC.
2.3.2.     One-Wire Interface – ZACwire™
The ZSSC3015 communicates via a one-wire serial interface. There are different commands available for the
following:
     •   Reading the conversion result of the ADC (Get_BR_Raw, Get_T_Raw)
     •   Calibration commands
     •   Reading from the EEPROM (dump of entire contents)
     •   Writing to the EEPROM (trim setting, configuration, and coefficients)
2.4.       Output Stage
2.4.1.     Digital to Analog Converter (Output DAC) with Programmable Clipping Limits
A 12-bit DAC based on sub-ranging resistor strings is used for the digital-to-analog output conversion in the
analog ratiometric and absolute analog voltage modes. Options during calibration configure the system to operate
in either of these modes. The design allows for excellent testability as well as low power consumption.
The DAC allows programming a lower and upper clipping limit for the output signal (analog and digital). See
Up_Clip_Lim and Low_Clip_Lim in section 3.6. The internal 14-bit calculated bridge value is compared against the
14-bit value formed by {11,Up_Clip_Lim[6:0],11111} for the upper limit and {00,Low_Clip_Lim[6:0],00000} for the
lower limit. If the calculated bridge value is higher than the upper limit or less than the lower limit, the analog
output value is clipped to this value; otherwise it is output as is.
Example for the upper clipping level: If the Up_Clip_Lim[6:0] = 0000000, then the 14-bit value used for the
clipping threshold is 11000000011111. This is 75.19% of full scale. Since there are 7 bits of upper clipping limit,
there are 127 possible values between 75.19% and 100%. Therefore the resolution of the clipping limits 0.195%.
Example for the lower clipping level: If the Low_Clip_Lim[6:0] = 1111111, then the 14-bit value used for the
clipping threshold is 00111111100000. This is 24.8% of full scale. Since there are 7 bits of lower clipping limit,
there are 127 possible values between 0 and 24.8%. Therefore the resolution of the lower clipping limit is 0.195%.
Figure 2.2 shows the data timing of the DAC output for the update rate setting 00. Refer to the ZSSC3015
Response Time Spreadsheet for details.

                                                                                                 ZSSC3015 Datasheet
2.4.2.     Output Buffer and Output Short Circuit Protection
A rail-to-rail op amp configured as a unity gain buffer can drive resistive loads (whether pull-up or pull-down) as
low as 5kΩ and capacitances up to 15nF (for pure analog output). In addition, to limit the error due to amplifier
offset voltage, an error compensation circuit is included which tracks and reduces offset voltage to < 1mV.
The output of the ZSSC3015 output can be permanently shorted to VDD or VSS without damaging the device.
The output driver contains a current-limiting block that detects a hard short and limits the current to a safe level.
The output short circuit protection current can vary from a minimum of 3mA to a maximum of 20mA depending on
operating conditions. Output short circuit protection can be enabled via Diag_cfg (EEPROM [102:100]). Enabling
this protection is recommended when using the analog output. See Table 3.6 for settings.
2.4.3.     Voltage Reference Block
A linear regulator control circuit is included in the Voltage Reference block to interface with an external JFET to
allow operation in systems where the supply voltage exceeds 5.5V. This circuit can also be used for over-voltage
protection. The regulator set point has a coarse adjustment controlled by the JFET_cfg EEPROM bits that can
adjust the set point around 5.0 or 5.5V. (See Table 3.6 for bit locations and section 2.3.1 regarding writing to the
EEPROM.). The 1V trim setting (see below) can also act as a fine adjust for the regulation set point. The 5V
reference can be trimmed within +/-15mV.
Note: If using the external JFET for over-voltage protection purposes (i.e., 5V at JFET drain and expecting 5V at
JFET source), there will be a voltage drop across the JFET; therefore ratiometricity will be slightly compromised
depending on the rds(on) of the chosen JFET. A J107 is the best choice because it has only an 8mV drop worst
case. If using as regulation instead of over-voltage, a MMBF4392 or BSS169 also works well.
The Voltage Reference block uses the absolute reference voltage provided by the bandgap to produce two
regulated on-chip voltage references. A 1V reference is used for the output DAC high reference when the part is
configured in 0-1V Analog Output Mode. For this reason, the 1V reference must be very accurate and includes
trim so that its value can be trimmed within +/- 3mV of 1.00V. The 1V reference is also used as the on-chip
reference for the JFET regulator. The regulation set point of the JFET regulator can be fine-tuned using the 1V
trim.
The reference trim setting is selected with the 1V_Trim/JFET_Trim bits in EEPROM. See Table 3.6 for bit
locations. Table 2.1 shows the order of trim codes with 0111 for the lowest reference voltage and 1000 for the
highest reference voltage.
Important: Optimal reference trim is determined during wafer-level testing and final package testing. Back-up
copies of these bits are stored in bits in the CUST_ID0 bits for applications requiring accurate references. In this
case, see section 5 for important notes and instructions for verifying the integrity of the 1V_Trim/JFET_Trim bits
and if necessary, restoring the value from the CUST_ID0 bits before calibration.

2.5.       Clock Generator / Power-On Reset (CLKPOR)
If the power supply exceeds 2.5V (maximum), the reset signal de-asserts and the clock generator starts operating
at a frequency of approximately 570kHz (±10%). The exact value only influences the conversion cycle time and
communication to the outside world but not the accuracy of signal processing.
2.6. Diagnostic Features
The ZSSC3015 offers a full suite of diagnostic features to ensure robust system operation in the most “mission-
critical” applications. If the part is programmed in Analog Output Mode, then diagnostic states are indicated by an
output below 2.5% of VDD or above 97.5% of VDD. If the part is programmed in Digital Output Mode, then
diagnostic states will be indicated by a transmission with a generated parity error.

2.6.1.        EEPROM Integrity
The contents of the EEPROM are protected by an 8-bit LFSR signature (linear feedback shift register). This sig-
nature is regenerated and stored in EEPROM every time EEPROM contents are changed. This signature is gen-
erated and checked for a match after Power-On Reset prior to entering Normal Operation Mode. If the generated
signature fails to match, the part will output a diagnostic state on the output.
In addition to an extensive temporal and code interlock mechanism used to prevent false writes to the EEPROM,
the ZSSC3015 offers an EEPROM lock mechanism for high-security applications. When EEPROM bits 105:103
are programmed with “011” or “110,” this 3-bit field will disable the VPP charge pump and will not allow further
writes to the EEPROM.
2.6.2.        Sensor Connection Check
Four dedicated comparators permanently check the range of the bridge inputs (BP/BN) to ensure they are within
the envelope of 0.8V to 0.85∗VDD during all conversions. The two sensor inputs have a switched ohmic path to
ground and if left floating, would be discharged. If any of the wires connecting the bridge break, this mechanism
will detect it and put the ZSSC3015 in a diagnostic state. This same diagnostic feature can also detect a short
between BP/BN and the ExtTemp signal if an external diode is being used for temperature measurement. See
Table 2.2 in section 2.6 for more information.

  All timings assume nominal operating frequency of 570kHz.

  A short from ExtTemp to BP/BN might not be detected in some circuit configurations.

                                                                                                   ZSSC3015 Datasheet
2.6.3.     Sensor Short Check
If a short occurs between BP/BN (bridge inputs), it would normally produce an in-range output signal and there-
fore would not be detected as a fault. This diagnostic mode, if enabled, will deliberately look for such a short. After
the measurement cycle of the bridge, it will deliberately pull the BP bridge input to ground for 4µsec. At the end of
this 4µsec window, it will check to see if the BN input “followed” it down below the 0.8V comparator checkpoint. If
so, a short must exist between BP/BN, and the ZSSC3015 will output a diagnostic state. The bridge will have a
minimum of 480µsec recovery time prior to the next measurement. See Table 2.2 in section 2.6 for more
information.
The bridge resistance must be taken into account if the Sensor Short diagnostic feature is used. At VDD = 2.7V,
the minimum bridge resistance is 0.3KΩ, and at VDD = 5V, the minimum bridge resistance is 0.6KΩ.
2.6.4.     Power Loss Detection
If the power or GND connection to the module containing the sensor bridge and ZSSC3015 is lost, the ZSSC3015
will output a diagnostic state if a pull-up or pull-down terminating resistor greater than or equal to 5kΩ is
connected in the final application. This diagnostic mode only functions when the part is configured in Analog
Output Mode. For more information, see Table 2.2 in section 2.6.
2.6.5.     ExtTemp Connection Checks
When external temperature is selected and connection checking is enabled, the part performs range checking on
the converted temperature value. If the internal ADC reading of the temperature is less than 1/32 of full scale or
greater than 63/64 of full scale then a diagnostic state is asserted. If the ExtTemp pin is shorted to ground, the
ADC reads less than 1/32. Because 100µA is sourced onto the ExtTemp pin during conversions, it naturally pulls
up during these times. If the ExtTemp pin is open, it produces an ADC reading greater than 63/64 of full scale.
Both these bad connection conditions would be detected and result in a diagnostic output. If internal temperature
is selected or sensor connection check is not enabled, then this diagnostic check is not enabled. See Table 2.2 in
section 2.6 for more information.

3          Functional Description
3.1.       General Working Mode
                                                                                             TM
The command/data transfer takes place via the one-wire Sig™ pin using the ZACwire               serial communication
protocol.
After power-on, the ZSSC3015 provides a command window for 3.5ms or 10ms. (The command window length
depends on the setting of the Fast_Startup EEPROM bit; see section 3.6). During the command window, the
ZSSC3015 is waiting for a Start_CM command. Without this command, the Normal Operation Mode (NOM) starts.
In this mode, raw bridge values are converted and the corrected values are presented on the output in analog or
digital format (depending on the configuration stored in EEPROM). If the ZSSC3015 receives the Start_CM
command during the command window, it remains in Command Mode (CM). The CM allows changing to one of
the other modes via command. (See section 3.4 for command encoding.) If the Start_RM command is sent, the
ZSSC3015 enters the Raw Mode (RM). Without correction, the raw values are transmitted to the digital output in a
predefined order. The RM can only be stopped by a power down. Raw Mode is used by the calibration software
for collection of raw bridge and temperature data so the correction coefficients can be calculated.
If diagnostic features are enabled and a diagnostic fault is detected, diagnostic states are indicated as follows
depending on the programmed mode:
     •   In Analog Output Mode:
         Diagnostic states are indicated by an output below 2.5% of VDD or above 97.5% of VDD.
     •   In Digital Output Mode:
         Diagnostic states will be indicated by a transmission with a generated parity error.

3.2.       Normal Mode Sample Rate
When the ZSSC3015 is in Normal Operation Mode, the output rate depends mainly on the settings for the update
rate and Output Mode. Table 3.1 shows the nominal sample rate for analog output across update rate settings for
Analog Output Mode. See section 3.3.4 for information on reading the ZSSC3015 and the overall update and
transmission time when in Digital Mode. The average response time shown in Table 3.1 accounts for 1.5 samples
at nominal frequency and temperature. The worst-case response time accounts for process and temperature
deviation on the oscillator. The worst case only occurs if the input changes immediately prior to a special
measurement. See the ZSSC3015 Response Time Spreadsheet for details on the average and worst-case
response time depending on the ZSSC3015 configuration.

The incoming serial signal will be sampled at a 570kHz clock rate. This protocol is very tolerant to clock skew, and
can easily tolerate a wide range of baud rates. The incoming baud rate should be in the 8kHz to 52kHz range
(36kHz nominal).
3.3.4.     ZSSC3015 Read Operations
The incoming frame will be checked for proper parity on both command and data bytes, as well as for any edge
time-outs prior to a full frame being received.
After a command/data pair is received, the ZSSC3015 will perform that command. After the command has been
successfully executed by the ZSSC3015, it will acknowledge success by a transmission of an A5HEX byte back to
the master. If the master does not receive an A5H transmission within 130ms of issuing the command, it must
assume the command was either improperly received or could not be executed.

The ZSSC3015 transmits 10-bit bytes (1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 parity bit). During calibration and configuration,
transmissions are normally either A5HEX or data. A5HEX indicates successful completion of a command. There are
two different digital output modes configurable (digital output with temperature and digital output with only bridge
data). During Normal Operation Mode, if the part is configured for digital output of the bridge reading, it first
transmits the high byte of bridge data, followed by the low byte. The bridge data is 14 bits in resolution, so the
upper two bits of the high byte are always zero-padded. There is a stop bit time between bytes in a packet. This
means that for the time of a bit width, the signal level is high.

The second option for Digital Output Mode is digital output bridge reading with temperature. It will be transmitted
as 3 data packets. The temperature byte represents an 8-bit temperature quantity spanning from -50 to 150°C.

There is a variable idle time between packets. This idle time varies with the update rate setting in EEPROM.

Table 3.3 shows the idle time between packets versus the update rate. This idle time can vary by nominal +/-15%

conversion at each special measurement.

Transmissions from the ZSSC3015 occur at one of two speeds depending on the update rate programmed in
EEPROM. If the user chooses one of the two fastest update rates (00BIN or 01BIN) then the baud rate of the digital
transmission will be 36kHz. However, if the user chooses one of the two slower update rates (10BIN or 11BIN), then
the baud rate of the digital transmission will be 9kHz.
The      total     transmission         time      for      both      digital     output      configurations         is    shown       in

It is easy to program any standard microcontroller to communicate with the ZSSC3015. IDT can provide sample
                                ®
code for a MicroChip PIC microcontroller.
3.3.5.       High Level Protocol
The ZSSC3015 will listen for a command/data pair to be transmitted for the 3.5ms or 10ms (depending on the
setting of the Fast_Startup EEPROM bit; see section 3.6) after the de-assertion of its internal Power-On Reset
(POR). If a transmission is not received within this time frame, then it will transition to Normal Operation Mode
(NOM). In the NOM, it will output bridge data in 0-1V analog, rail-to-rail ratiometric analog, or digital depending on
how the part is currently configured.
If the ZSSC3015 receives a Start_CM command within the first 3.5ms or 10ms after the de-assertion of POR,
then it will go into Command Mode (CM). In this mode, calibration/configuration commands will be executed. The
ZSSC3015 will acknowledge successful execution of commands by transmission of A5HEX. The calibrating
/configuring master will know a command was not successfully executed if no response is received within 130ms
after issuing the command. Once in command interpreting/executing mode, the ZSSC3015 will stay in this mode
until power is removed or a Start_NOM (Start Normal Operation Mode) command is received. The Start_CM
command is used as an interlock mechanism to prevent a spurious entry into Command Mode on power up. The
first command received within the command window must be a Start_CM command to enter into command
interpreting mode. Any other commands will be ignored.

3.5.       Calibration Sequence
Although the ZSSC3015 can work with many different types of resistive bridges, assume a pressure bridge is
being used for the following discussion on calibration.
For this pressure sensing application, calibration essentially involves collecting raw bridge and temperature data
from the ZSSC3015 for different known pressures and temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the
calibration master (typically a PC) to compute the coefficients, and the calculated coefficients can then be written
to the ZSSC3015.
IDT can provide software and hardware with samples to perform the calibration.
There are three main steps to calibration:
     1.   Assigning a unique identification to the ZSSC3015. This identification is programmed in EEPROM and
         can be used as an index into the database stored on the calibration PC. This database will contain all the
         raw values of bridge readings and temperature readings for that part, as well as the known pressure (for
         this application) and temperature the bridge was exposed to. This unique identification can be stored in a
         concatenation of the following EEPROM registers: Cust_ID0, Cust_ID1, Cust_ID2. These registers can
         also form a permanent serial number.
     2. Data collection. Data collection involves getting raw data from the bridge at different known pressures and
         temperatures. This data is then stored on the calibration PC using the unique identification of the
         ZSSC3015 as the index to the database.
     3. Coefficient calculation and write. After enough data points have been collected to calculate all the desired
         coefficients then the coefficients can be calculated by the calibrating PC and written to the ZSSC3015.

                                                                                                   ZSSC3015 Datasheet
Step 1 – Assigning Unique Identification
Assigning a unique identification number is as simple as using the commands Program Cust_ID0, Program
Cust_ID1 and Program Cust_ID2. These three 8-bit registers allow for more than 16 million unique devices.
Step 2 – Data Collection
The number of unique (pressure, temperature) points that calibration must be performed at depends on the user’s
needs. The minimum is a 2-point calibration, and the maximum is a 5-point calibration. To acquire raw data from
the part, set the ZSSC3015 to enter Raw Mode. This is done by issuing a Start_CM (Start Command Mode
5090HEX) command/data pair to the ZSSC3015 followed by a Start_RM (Start Raw Mode 4010HEX) command/data
pair. Now if the Gain_B term has been set to unity (800HEX) and the Gain_T term has been set to unity (80HEX),
then the part will be in the Raw Mode and will output raw data on its Sig™ pin instead of corrected bridge and
temperature. Capture several of these data points with the user’s calibration system (capturing 16 each of bridge
and temperature raw measurements is recommended) and average them. For highest accuracy, start gathering
calibration data after the first special measurement has been completed. Store these raw bridge and temperature
settings in the database along with the known pressure and temperature. The output format during Raw Mode is
Bridge_High, Bridge_Low, Temp. Each of these is an 8-bit quantity. The upper 2-bits of Bridge_High are zero-
filled. The Temp data (8 bits only) would not be enough information for accurate temperature calibration.
Therefore the upper three bits of temperature information are not given, but rather assumed known. Therefore
effectively 11-bits of temperature information are provided in this mode.
Step 3 – Coefficient Calculations
The math to perform the coefficient calculation is very complicated and will not be discussed in detail. There is a
rough overview in the “Calibration Math” section. IDT will provide software to perform the coefficient calculation.
After the coefficients are calculated, the final step is to write them to the EEPROM of the ZSSC3015.
The number of calibration points required can be as few as two or as many as five. This depends on the precision
desired and the behavior of the resistive bridge in use.
      1. 2-point calibration can be used if only a gain and offset term are needed for a bridge with no temperature
          compensation for either term.
                                                         st
      2. 3-point calibration would be used to obtain 1 order compensation for either a Tco or Tcg term but not
          both.
                                                              nd
      3. 3-point calibration could also be used to obtain 2 order correction for the bridge but no temperature
          compensation of the bridge output.
                                                         st
      4. 4-point calibration would be used to obtain 1 order compensation for both Tco and Tcg.
                                                              st                                 nd
      5. 4-point calibration could also be used to obtain 1 order compensation for Tco and a 2 order correction
          for the bridge measurement.
                                                               st                        st
      6. 5-point calibration would be used to obtain both 1 order Tco correction and 1 order Tcg correction, plus
              nd                                                                             nd            nd
          a 2 order correction that could be applied to one and only one of the following: 2 order Tco, 2 order
                    nd
          Tcg, or 2 order bridge.

        SOT          Second Order Term. The SOT can be applied as a second-order correction term for one of the
                     following:
                         • Bridge measurement
                         • Temperature coefficient of offset (Tco)
                         • Temperature coefficient of gain (Tcg)
                     The EEPROM bits 99:98 determine which term SOT corrects.
        TSETL        RAW_PTAT or ExtTemp reading (upper 7-bits) at low temperature at which calibration was performed
                     (typically room temperature).
        Tcg          Temperature correction coefficient of bridge gain term.
                     Note: This term has an 8-bit magnitude and a sign bit (Tc_cfg[2]).
        Tco          Temperature correction coefficient of bridge offset term.
                     Note: This term has an 8-bit magnitude, a sign bit (Tc_cfg[0]), and a scaling bit (Tc_cfg[1]), which can
                     multiply its magnitude by 8.
3.7.2.     Interpretation of Binary Numbers for Correction Coefficients
BR_Raw should be interpreted as an unsigned number in the set [0, 16383] with a resolution of 1.
T_Raw should be interpreted as an unsigned number in the set [0, 16383], with a resolution of 4.
3.7.2.1. Gain_B Interpretation
Gain_B should be interpreted as a value in the set [0, 64]. The MSB (bit 14) is a scaling bit that will multiply the
effect of the Gain_B[13:0] term by 8. The remaining bits Gain_B[13:0] represent a number in the range of [0,8)
with Gain_B[13] having a weighting of 4, and each subsequent bit has a weighting of ½ the previous bit.

Examples:
    The binary number: 010010100110001BIN = 4.6489; Gain_B[14] is 0, so the number represented by
    Gain_B[13:0] is not multiplied by 8.
    The binary number: 101100010010110BIN = 24.586; Gain_B[14] is 1, so the number represented by

3.7.2.2. Offset_B Interpretation
Offset_B is a 14-bit unsigned binary number, the Offset_B_sign bit is pre-pended to the number to create a 15-bit
2’s complement signed value. The bit weightings of {Offset_B_sign, Offset_B[13:0]} are shown in Table 3.9.

For example, the binary number 0 1111 1111 1100BIN = 4092.
However, with the Offset_B_sign bit set, the binary number 1 1111 1111 1100BIN = -4.
3.7.2.3. Gain_T Interpretation
Gain_T should be interpreted as a number in the set [0,2]. Gain_T[7] has a weighting of 1, and each subsequent
bit has a weighting of ½ the previous bit.

3.7.2.5. Tco Interpretation
Tco is specified as having an 8-bit magnitude with an additional sign bit and a scalar bit (Tc_cfg). When the scalar
bit is set, the signed Tco is multiplied by 8.
     • Tco Resolution: 0.175 μV/V/ C
                                          o
                                                       (referenced to input)
     • Tco Range:           ± 44.6 μV/V/ C

                                                       (referenced to input)
If the scaling bit is used, then the above resolution and range are scaled by 8 to give the following results:
     • Tco Scaled Resolution: 1.40 μV/V/ C (referenced to input)
                                                 o
     • Tco Scaled Range:              ± 357 μV/V/ C (referenced to input)

3.7.2.6. Tcg Interpretation
Tcg is specified as an 8-bit magnitude with an additional sign bit (Tc_cfg).
     • Tcg Resolution: 17.0 ppm/ C
                                        o
     • Tcg Range:
                                          o
                            ±4335 ppm/ C
3.7.2.7. SOT Interpretation
              nd
SOT is a 2 order term that can apply to one and only one of the following: bridge nonlinearity correction, Tco
nonlinearity correction, or Tcg nonlinearity correction.
As it applies to bridge nonlinearity correction:
     • Resolution: 0.25% @ Full Scale
     • Range:          +25% @ Full Scale to -25% @ Full Scale
         (Saturation in internal arithmetic will occur at greater negative nonlinearities.)

As it applies to Tcg:
    • Resolution: 0.3 ppm/( C)
                                   o    2
    • Range:

                      +/- 38ppm/( C)
As it applies to Tco:
   2 settings are possible. It is possible to scale the effect of SOT by 8. If Tc_cfg[1] is set, then both Tco and
   SOT’s contribution to Tco are multiplied by 8.
    • Resolution at unity scaling: 1.51nV/V/( C) (referenced to input)
                                                        o   2

3.8.       Reading EEPROM Contents
The contents of the entire EEPROM memory can be read out using the Read EEPROM command (00HEX). This
command causes the ZSSC3015 to output consecutive bytes on the ZACwire™ interface. After each
transmission, the EEPROM contents are shifted by 8 bits. The bit order of these bytes is given in Table 3.12.

4          Application Circuit Examples
The minimum output analog load resistor is RL= 5kΩ. This optional load resistor can be configured as a pull-up or
pull-down. If it is configured as a pull-down, it cannot be part of the module to be calibrated because this would
prevent proper operation of the ZACwire™. If a pull-down load is desired, it must be added to system after
module calibration.
There is no output load capacitance needed.

4.3.       Three-Wire Ratiometric Output with Over-Voltage Protection
The figure below shows an application circuit for a ratiometric output configuration with temperature compensation
via the internal PTAT. In this application, the JFET is used for voltage protection. JFET_cfg (16:15) in the
EEPROM is configured to 5.5V. There is an additional maximum error of 8mV caused by the non-zero rON of the
limiter JFET.

4.4.       Digital Output
For all three circuits, the output signal can also be digital. Depending on the output select bits, the bridge signal or
the bridge signal and temperature signal are sent. For the digital output, no load resistor or load capacity is
necessary. No pull-down resistor is allowed. If a line resistor or pull-up resistor is used, the requirement for the
rise time must be met (< 5µs). The ZSSC3015 output includes an internal pull-up resistor of about 30kΩ. The
digital output can easily be read by firmware from a microcontroller, and IDT can provide the customer with
software for developing the interface.
4.5.       Output Resistor/Capacitor Limits
The limits for external components depend on the programmed output mode:
   • Pure Analog Output Mode (calibration is done before): The only limit is the minimum load resistance of 5kΩ.
   • Pure Digital Output Mode with end-of-line calibration: The RC time constant of the ZACwire™ line must have
     a rise time ≤ 5µs.
   • Analog output with digital communication during calibration: The RC time constant of the ZACwire™ line must
     have a rise time ≤ 5µs.
Warning: Any series line resistance forms a voltage divider in conjunction with the pull-up load device. If a series
line resistance is needed, choose a low value relative to the pull-up load device.

5          EEPROM Restoration
If needed, the default settings for the ZSSC3015 (see Table 3.6) can be reprogrammed as described in section 3.
The following sections describe EEPROM content validation and handling during and/or after system assembly.
Important: During the sawing and dicing process, there is a possibility of the EEPROM contents flipping, and
prevention cannot be guaranteed. This is primarily a concern for the factory trim settings, which are customized to
each part. If purchasing packaged parts, the EEPROM contents have already been returned to their default
values and this section can be ignored.
The EEPROM default values programmed during the different test levels have been selected so that customer
has the option to refresh/reprogram trim bits that might have flipped during sawing or dicing.
Important: The EEPROM lock is stored in the bit range 105:103. A value of 6HEX or 3HEX will lock the EEPROM,
disabling the charge pump needed for EEPROM writing. The lock may be temporarily ignored by using the
EEPROM Force Unlock command (E800HEX) in Command Mode. This will re-enable the charge pump until the
next reset. Alternatively, the EEPROM Force Unlock command could be issued in Command Mode and the lock
itself may be reprogrammed in EEPROM at this time. The complete contents can also be validated using the
EEPROM signature stored in bits [151:144], (see “Signature” in Table 3.6).
5.1.       Default EEPROM Contents
During the wafer level test (wafer/dice delivery) and during final test for SOP8 packaged parts, the EEPROM is
programmed with the default values listed in the Table 3.6.
During the wafer level test, the trim bits in 1V_Trim/JFET_Trim [6:3] are set to die-specific values.
5.1.1.     1V_Trim/JFET_Trim
The 5V reference for the JFET regulation is factory trimmed during the final test to 5V±15mV using the 1V_Trim/
JFET_Trim bit setting. The 4-bit setting stored in EEPROM bits [6:3] is copied twice to the Cust_ID0 bits [127:124]
and [123:120] to ensure the factory settings are retained so that the customer can reprogram these values in the
1V_Trim/JFET_Trim bits if needed.
5.2.       EEPROM Restoration Procedure
After module assembly, the EEPROM content should be refreshed. If JFET regulation is not used for the cus-
tomer’s application, write the default values shown in Table 3.6 to the EEPROM bit range [143:7] and retain the
existing values in the bit range [6:0]. If JFET regulation is required, the bit restoration procedure shown in the flow
chart in Figure 5.1 must be used to keep the factory settings that were programmed during the testing.
Note: The EEPROM signature is re-calculated and updated after every EEPROM writing.

7           ESD/Latch-Up-Protection
All pins have an ESD protection of ≥4000V and a latch-up protection of ±100 mA or of +8V/ –4V (to VSS/VSSA).
ESD protection referenced to the Human Body Model is tested with devices in SOP-8 packages during product
qualification. The ESD test follows the Human Body Model with 1.5kΩ/100pF based on MIL 883, Method 3015.7.
8           Test
The test program is based on this datasheet. The final parameters that will be tested during series production are
listed in the tables of section 1.
The digital part of the ZSSC3015 includes IDDQ and a scan chain with a boundary scan, which can be activated
and controlled during wafer test. Further test support for testing of the analog parts on wafer level is included in
the DSP.
9           Quality and Reliability
The ZSSC3015 is qualified according to the AEC-Q100 standard, operating temperature grade 0. A fit rate <5fit
(temp=55°C, S=60%) is guaranteed. A typical fit rate of the C7A-technology, which is used for ZSSC3015, is
2.7fit.
