   [b] See section 7 for full details on output pad drive strengths.
   [c] An external isolating capacitor allows a non-galvanic connection to special differential or external reference sensor types. CCC could also be used
         to lower the overall capacitance level to a value that is supported by the ZSSC3122 because it limits the maximum capacitance seen by the
         ZSSC3122 input to CC even if C0 and C1 have higher values. See section 9.2.1.3 for more details.

6. Current Consumption Graphs
Part current consumption depends on a number of different factors including voltage, temperature, capacitive input, resolution, and power down
time. The best way to calculate the ZSSC3122’s power consumption is to measure the current consumption with the actual setup. If
measurement is not possible, then the graphs in this section can provide a starting point for estimating the current consumption.

8. Temperature Sensor Nonlinearity
Temperature sensor nonlinearity can vary depending on the type of calibration and the selected calibration points. It is highly recommended
that a temperature calibration is done with calibration points at least 20°C apart from each other. Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2 show the resulting
nonlinearity error for the full temperature range (-20°C to 125°C) using the optimal calibration points, 0°C and 100°C for a first-order fit and -
20°C, 40°C, and 100°C for a second-order fit.

9. Circuit Description
9.1        Signal Flow and Block Diagram
As seen in Figure 9.1, the ZSSC3122 comprises three main blocks: the analog core, digital core, and output communication. The capacitive
input is first sampled by the analog core using a charge-balancing CDC and is adjusted for the appropriate capacitance range using the
CDC_Offset, and CDC_Reference. The digital core corrects the digital sample with an on-chip digital signal processor (DSP), which uses
coefficients stored in EEPROM for precise conditioning. An internal temperature sensor can be used to compensate for temperature effects of
the capacitive input. A temperature value can also be calibrated and output as a 14-bit reading.
The corrected capacitance value can be read using four different output types, I2C, SPI, PDM, and alarms. They can all be directly interfaced
with a microcontroller, and optional filtering of the PDM output can provide a ratiometric analog output. The alarm pins can also be used to
control a variety of analog circuitry.

9.2        Analog Front-End
9.2.1 Capacitance-to-Digital Converter
A 1st order charge-balancing capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) is used to convert the input capacitance to the digital domain. The CDC
uses a chopper-stabilized design to decrease any drift over temperature. The CDC interfaces to the sensor capacitor through the input
multiplexer that controls whether the measurement is a capacitance or a temperature measurement. The input multiplexer also allows for two
sensor capacitance configurations: a single sensor capacitance or a ratio based differential capacitive sensor, two-sensor, capacitor
configuration, where the reference capacitor is part of the sensor.
As part of a switched-capacitor network the reference capacitor C1 is driven by a square wave voltage of the frequency fEXC (refer to section 5).
The sensor capacitance C0 is not exposed to DC voltages in order to prevent aging effects of some sensor types. The configuration of the CDC
is controlled by programming settings in EEPROM word C_Config. (See Table 12.3 for settings.)
9.2.1.1 Single Ended
In the case of a single-sensor capacitor, the CDC output is proportional to the ratio of the sensor capacitor to an internal reference capacitor
(CREF). This internal reference capacitor value can be adjusted using the 3-bit trim CDC_Reference (bit settings in Table 12.3). To optimize the
measured end-resolution further, another internal capacitor (COFF) allows the subtraction of a defined offset capacitance using the 3-bit trim
CDC_Offset (bit setting in Table 12.3). Equations (1) to (2) describe the CDC output for a single sensor capacitance measurement. Select the
values of CDC_Offset and CDC_Reference by using the tables in section 9.2.1.4.

9.2.1.2 Single Ended with External Reference
Some sensors include an external reference capacitor as part of the sensor construction. If the external reference capacitance (C1) is constant
or increases with increasing input sensor capacitance (C0), then use CDC output equations (5) to (7). In this case, the CDC_Reference should
be set to zero (see bit setting in Table 12.3).

9.2.1.3 Differential
A differential capacitive sensor includes two capacitors C0 and C1 that are captured as a ratio. The differential sensor is built so that the sensor
input capacitance C0 increases while the external reference capacitance C1 decreases over the input signal range, but the total sum always
remains constant. Equations (8) and (9) describe the CDC output for a differential sensor capacitance measurement. The CDC_Reference and
CDC_Offset capacitor trim bits must be set to zero, and the Differential bit must be set to one. (See Table 12.3 for bit numbers and settings.)
The sum of C0 and C1 must not exceed the maximum input range of 10pF, except when CC is used as a decoupling capacitor.
In differential mode, special sensor types can allow a non-galvanic connection with an external isolating capacitor CCC between the sensor and
the CC pin to avoid wear caused by mechanical moving parts.

9.2.1.4 Capacitive Range Selection
For singled ended sensors, use Table 9.1 as guidance to select appropriate values for the CDC (COFF) and (CREF) for a particular capacitance
input range. The CDC_Offset and CDC_Reference bits are found in EEPROM word C_Config. (See Table 12.3 for bit numbers). Using the
settings given in Table 9.1, the CDC input range can be adjusted to optimize the coverage of the sensor signal and offset values to give the
maximum sensor span that can be processed without losing resolution. Choose a range by fitting the input sensor span within the narrowest
range in the table, but note that these tables are only approximate, so the range should be chosen by experimenting with the actual setup. Also
note that since internal capacitance values can vary over process (see specification parameter Ctol in section 5), the minimum and maximum
sensor span should be at least ±10% within the minimum and maximum of the chosen range respectively.
Note: A CREF setting of 0 (marked with * in the following tables) is only supported with an external reference capacitor (C1) for single-ended
sensors. C1 capacitance values should be within the defined range.

Note: Capacitance ranges are nominal values.
Note: Production-related tolerances can change the nominal capacitance values by 10%.

9.2.2 Temperature Measurement
The temperature signal comes from an internal PTAT (proportional to absolute temperature) circuit that is a measure of the die temperature.
The PTAT (VPTAT) voltage is used in the CDC to charge an internal capacitor (CT), while the bandgap voltage (VBG) is used to charge the offset
and the reference trimmable capacitors. The CDC temperature output (ZTEMP) is defined by equations (10) to (13):

it is strongly recommended that these settings not be changed.

9.3       Digital Core
The digital core provides control logic for the analog front-end, performs input signal conditioning, and handles external communication. A digital
signal processor (DSP) is used for conditioning and correcting the converted sensor and temperature inputs. The DSP can correct for up to a
two-region piece-wise nonlinear sensor input, and up to a second-order nonlinear temperature input. Alternatively a third-order correction of the
sensor input for one region and up to a second-order nonlinear temperature input can be selected. Refer to section 13 for details on the signal
conditioning and correction math. The analog front-end configuration and correction coefficients for both the capacitive sensor and the
temperature sensor are stored in an on-chip EEPROM (see section 12).
Four different types of outputs are available: I2C, SPI, PDM, and the Alarms. These output modes are used in combination with the two
measurement modes: Update Mode and Sleep Mode. For a full description of normal operation in each mode, refer to section 10.
The ZSSC3122 has an internal 1.85MHz temperature-compensated oscillator that provides the time base for all operations. When VDD exceeds
the POR level, the reset signal de-asserts and the clock generator starts. See section 10.1 for the subsequent power-up sequence. The exact
clock frequency influences the measurement cycle time (see the frequency variation spec in section 5). To minimize the oscillator error as the
VDD voltage changes, an on-chip regulator supplies the oscillator block.

10.1 Power-On Sequence
Figure 10.2 shows the power-on sequence of the ZSSC3122. On system power-on reset (POR), the ZSSC3122 wakes as an I2C device
regardless of the output protocol programmed in EEPROM. After power-on reset, the ZSSC3122 enters the command window. It then waits for
a Start_CM command for 3ms if the Fast_Startup EEPROM bit is set or 10ms otherwise (see Table 12.5). If the ZSSC3122 receives the
Start_CM command during the command window, it enters and remains in Command Mode. Command Mode is primarily used in the calibration
environment. See section 11 for details on Command Mode.
If during the power-on sequence, the command window expires without receiving a Start_CM or if the part receives a Start_NOM command in
Command Mode, the device will immediately assume its programmed output mode and will perform one complete measurement cycle. Timing
for the initial measurement is described in section 10.2. At the end of the capacitance DSP calculation, the first data is written to the output
register. Beyond this point, conversions are performed according to the programmed measurement mode settings (see section 10.3).

Note: See section 10.2 for timing of the measurement cycle. Timing values shown are typical; for the worst case values, multiply by 1.1
(nominal frequency ±10%).
10.2 Measurement Cycle
Figure 10.3 shows a typical measurement cycle. At the start of a measurement, there is a small wakeup period and then an internal temperature
conversion/temperature DSP calculation is performed followed by a capacitance conversion/capacitance DSP calculation. The length of these
conversions depends on the setting of the Resolution bits (see Table 10.1). The resolution can be found in EEPROM words C_Config and
T_Config (see Table 12.3 and Table 12.4 for bit numbers). Each conversion cycle is followed by a DSP calculation, which uses the programmed
calibration coefficients to calculate corrected temperature and capacitance measurements. In Update Mode, a temperature conversion is not
performed every measurement cycle because it is considered a slower moving quantity. In this case, the measurement cycle timing is the same
as Figure 10.3 without the temperature conversion/ temperature DSP calculation (see section 10.3.1 for more information).

10.3 Measurement Modes
The ZSSC3122 can be programmed to operate in either Sleep Mode or Update Mode. The measurement mode is selected with the
Measurement_Mode bit in the ZMDI_Config EEPROM word (see Table 12.2). In Update Mode, measurements are taken at a fixed, selectable
rate (see section 10.3.1). In Sleep Mode, the part waits for commands from the master before taking measurements (see section 10.3.2).
Figure 10.1 shows the differences in operation between the two measurement modes.
10.3.1 Update Mode
In Update Mode, the digital core will perform conversions at an update rate selected with the Update_Rate bits in the ZMDI_Config EEPROM
word (see Table 12.2). Table 10.2 shows the power-down periods between conversions for the four Update_Rate settings. The benefit of slower
update rates is power savings. Update Mode is compatible with all the different output modes; I2C, SPI, PDMs, and the Alarms. As shown in
Figure 10.4, at the completion of a measurement cycle, the digital output register, PDMs, and/or Alarms will be updated before powering down.
When the power-down period expires, the ZSSC3122 will wake up and perform another measurement cycle. If the part is programmed for the
fastest update rate, there is no power down period, and measurements happen continuously.

Note: See section 10.2 for measurement cycle timing.
To calculate the total time between capacitive measurements in Update Mode, add the measurement cycle timing from section 10.2 and the
power down timing from Table 10.2. Typical settings might be a capacitance measurement with a resolution of 12-bits.
In this example, the time between measurements = (4.5ms + 0.1ms + 0.3ms) + (power down period). Table 10.3 shows the time between
measurements for the different update rate settings and bit resolutions.
Temperature measurements are performed every six capacitive measurements. The actual frequency of temperature conversions varies with
the update rate and AFE configuration settings. As shown in Figure 10.4, when a temperature measurement is performed, a capacitance
measurement occurs immediately after; as a result, the total measurement cycle time is increased by the length of the temperature
conversion/temperature DSP calculation.
To calculate the total time between temperature measurements in Update Mode, multiply the time between capacitive measurements as
calculated in the above text by six (there are six capacitive measurements to every temperature measurement) and then add the temperature
conversion time/temperature DSP calculation time from Table 10.1 For example, a temperature measurement with a resolution of 12-bits has
a conversion time/DSP calculation time of 4.5ms + 0.25ms (from Table 10.1). Continuing with the above example (12-bit capacitive
measurement), the time between temperature measurements is (capacitance update time * 6) + 4.75ms.

10.3.1.1           Data Fetch in Update Mode
In Update Mode, I2C and SPI are used to fetch data from the digital output register using a Data Fetch (DF) command (see section 10.6.3).
Detecting when data is ready to be fetched can be handled either by polling or by monitoring the Ready pin (see section 10.6.6 for details on
the Ready pin). The status bits of a DF tell whether or not the data is valid or stale (see section 10.4 regarding the status bits). As shown in
Figure 10.5 after a measurement cycle is complete, valid data can be fetched. If the next data fetch is performed too early, the data will be the
same as the previous fetch with stale status bits. As shown in Figure 10.5, a rise on the Ready pin can also be used to tell when valid data is
ready to be fetched.

10.3.2 Sleep Mode
In Sleep Mode, the digital core will only perform conversions when the ZSSC3122 receives a Measurement Request command (MR); otherwise,
the ZSSC3122 is always powered down. Measurement Request commands can only be sent using I2C or SPI, so PDM is not available. The
Alarms can be used in Sleep Mode but only in combination with I2C or SPI. More details about MR commands in Sleep Mode operation can be
found in section 10.3.2.1.
Note: Sleep Mode power consumption is significantly lower than Update Mode power consumption (see section 5 for exact values).
Figure 10.6 shows the measurement and communication sequence for Sleep Mode. The master sends an MR command to wake the ZSSC3122
from power down. After the ZSSC3122 wakes up, a measurement cycle is performed consisting of both a temperature and a capacitance
conversion followed by the DSP correction calculations.
At the end of a measurement cycle, the digital output register and Alarms will be updated before powering down. An I2C or SPI data fetch (DF)
is performed during the power-down period to fetch the data from the output register. In I2C the user can send another MR to start a new
measurement cycle without fetching the previous data, but in SPI, a DF must be done before another MR can be sent. After the data has been
fetched, the ZSSC3122 remains powered down until the master sends an MR command. The timing for measurements is given in section 10.2.

10.3.2.1           Data Fetch in Sleep Mode
In Sleep Mode, I2C and SPI are used to request a measurement with a MR command and to fetch data from the digital output register using a
Data Fetch (DF) command (see section 10.6.3).
As shown in Figure 10.7, after a measurement cycle is complete, valid data can be fetched. The preferred method of detecting valid data is to
wait for a rise on the Ready pin (see section 10.6.6 for details on the Ready pin). If the Ready pin is not available, the user must wait for the
measurements to complete before performing the DF (see section 10.2 for measurement timing). The status bits of the DF can be used to tell
whether the data is valid or stale (see section 10.4 regarding the status bits), but polling for the result must not be done before the time required
for conversion has elapsed.

10.4 Status and Diagnostics
Status bits (the two MSBs of the fetched high data byte, see Table 10.4) are provided in I2C and SPI but not in PDM. The status bits are used
to indicate the current state of the fetched data. Diagnostic detection is available in I2C, SPI, and PDM. In I2C and SPI diagnostics are reported
as a saturated high capacitance and temperature output (see Table 10.5). In PDM, diagnostics are reported as a railed high output level for
both PDM_C (capacitive PDM) and PDM_T (temperature PDM). If a diagnostic value is reported then one or more of the errors that are shown
in Table 10.6 occurred in normal operation.
Configuration EEPROM diagnostics are detected at initial power-up of the ZSSC3122 or a wakeup in Sleep Mode and are permanent
diagnostics. All other diagnostics are detected during a measurement cycle and reported in the subsequent data fetch for I2C or SPI or output
register update for PDM.

   Math Warning           Transient      An internal math overflow has occurred in the last measurement cycle and the output might be invalid.
10.4.1 EEPROM Error Detection and Correction
The contents of the EEPROM are protected via error checking and correction (ECC). Each of the 32 16-bit words contains 6 parity bits enabling
single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection (SEC and DED) per word. In Command Mode both SEC and DED errors are reported
in the response byte (see section 11.3). If the fetched EEPROM data has a DED error, then the fetched data will be incorrect; however, if a
SEC error was reported then the fetched data has been corrected, and it is the user’s choice to write the data back to attempt to correct the
error. During Normal Operation Mode, a diagnostic will be flagged on any DED error, but an SEC error will be automatically corrected and not
flagged as a diagnostic.
10.4.2 Alarm Diagnostics
The alarm outputs do not report diagnostics. If diagnostics are needed with alarm outputs, then either digital or PDM outputs must also be used.

10.6 I2C and SPI
Two wire I2C and three-wire read-only SPI are available for fetching data from the ZSSC3122. I2C is used to send calibration commands to the
ZSSC3122. To choose I2C or SPI, set the corresponding Output_Selection Bits in EEPROM word ZMDI_Config.
10.6.1 I2C Features and Timing
The ZSSC3122 uses an I2C-compatible communication protocol1 with support for 100kHz and 400kHz bit rates. The ZSSC3122 I2C slave
address (00HEX to 7FHEX) is selected by the Device_ID bits in the Cust_Config EEPROM word (see Table 12.5 for bit assignments). The device
will respond only to this address if the communication lock is set by programming 011BIN in the Comm_lock bits in the ZMDI_Config EEPROM
word (see Table 12.2 for bit assignments); otherwise, the device will respond to all I2C addresses. The factory setting for the I2C slave address
is 28HEX with Comm_lock set. See Figure 10.8 for the I2C timing diagram and Table 10.9 for definitions of the parameters shown in the diagram.

10.6.2 SPI Features and Timing
SPI is available only as half duplex (read-only from the ZSSC3122). SPI speeds of up to 800kHz can be supported. The SPI interface can be
programmed to allow the master to sample MISO on the falling-edge or rising-edge of SCL via the SPI_Phase bit in EEPROM word Cust_Config
(see Table 12.5 for bit assignments). See Figure 10.9 for the SPI timing diagram and Table 10.10 for definitions of the parameters shown in the
timing diagram.

10.6.4 Data Fetch (DF)
The Data Fetch (DF) command is used to fetch data in any digital output mode. With the start of communication (for I2C after reading the slave
address; for SPI at the falling edge of SS) the entire output packet will be loaded in a serial output register. The register will be updated after
the communication is finished. The output is always scaled to 14 bits independent of the programmed resolution. The ordering of the bits is big-
endian.
10.6.4.1         I2C Data Fetch
An I2C Data Fetch command starts with the 7-bit slave address and the 8th bit = 1 (READ). The ZSSC3122 as the slave sends an acknowledge
(ACK) indicating success. The number of data bytes returned by the ZSSC3122 is determined by when the master sends the NACK and stop
condition. Figure 10.10 shows examples of fetching two and three bytes respectively. The full 14 bits of capacitive data are fetched in the first
two bytes. The MSBs of the first byte are the status bits.
If temperature data is needed, additional temperature bytes can be fetched. In Figure 10.10, the three-byte data fetch returns 1 byte of
temperature data (8-bit accuracy) after the capacitive data. A fourth byte can be fetched where the six MSBs of the fetched byte are the six
LSBs of a 14-bit temperature measurement. The last two bits of the fourth byte are undetermined and should be masked off in the application.

10.6.4.2          SPI Data Fetch
By default the SPI interface will have data change after the falling edge of SCLK. The master should sample MISO on the rising (opposite) edge
of SCLK. This is configurable via the SPI_Phase bit in EEPROM word Cust_Config (see Table 12.5 for bit assignments). The SPI protocol can
handle high and low polarity of the clock line without configuration change.
As seen in Figure 10.11 the entire output packet is 4 bytes (32 bits). The high capacitive data byte comes first, followed by the low byte. Then
14 bits of corrected temperature (T[13:0]) are sent: first the T[13:6] byte and then the {T[5:0],xx} byte. The last 2 bits of the final byte are
undetermined and should be masked off in the application. If the user only requires the corrected capacitance value, the read can be terminated
after the 2nd byte. If the corrected temperature is also required but only at an 8-bit resolution, the read can be terminated after the 3rd byte is
read.

10.6.5 Measurement Request (MR)
A measurement request (MR) is a Sleep-Mode-only command sent by the master to wake up the ZSSC3122 and start a new measurement
cycle in both I2C and SPI modes. See section 10.3.2 for more information on Sleep Mode.
10.6.5.1          I2C Measurement Request
The I2C MR is used to wake up the device in Sleep Mode and start a complete measurement cycle starting with a temperature measurement,
followed by a capacitance measurement, followed by the DSP calculations, and then the results are written to the digital output register. As
shown in Figure 10.12, the communication contains only the slave address and the WRITE bit (0) sent by the master. After the ZSSC3122
responds with the slave ACK, the master creates a stop condition.
Note: The I2C MR function can also be accomplished by sending “don’t care” data after the address instead of immediately sending a stop bit.

10.6.5.2        SPI Measurement Request
The SPI MR is used to wake up the device in Sleep Mode and start a complete measurement cycle starting with a temperature
measurement/temperature DSP calculation, followed by a capacitance measurement / capacitance DSP calculations, and then the results are
written to the digital output register. As shown in Figure 10.13, executing an SPI MR command is a read of 8 bits, ignoring the data that is
returned.
Note: The SPI MR function can also be accomplished by performing a full SPI Data Fetch (see section 10.6.4.2) and ignoring the invalid data
that will be returned.

10.6.6 Ready Pin
A rise on the Ready pin indicates that new data is ready to be fetched from either the I2C or SPI interface. The Ready pin stays high until a
Data Fetch (DF) command is sent (see section 10.6.3); it stays high even if additional measurements are performed before the DF. In Sleep
Mode, sending a Measurement Request (MR) command resets the Ready pin.
The Ready pin’s output driver type is selectable as either full push-pull or open drain via the Ready_Open_Drain bit in EEPROM word
Cust_Config (see Table 12.5 for bit assignments and settings). Point-to-point communication most likely uses the full push-pull driver. If an
application requires interfacing to multiple parts, then the open-drain option can allow for just one wire and one pull-up resistor to connect all
the parts in a bus format.
10.7 PDM (Pulse Density Modulation)
PDM outputs for both corrected capacitance and temperature are available. PDM_C (capacitance PDM) appears on the READY/PDM_C pin,
and PDM_T (temperature PDM) appears on the ALARM_LOW/PDM_T pin if enabled using the Output_Selection bits (see Table 12.2). The
typical PDM frequency is 231.25kHz (i.e., the oscillator frequency 1.85MHz  minimum/maximum corners of the oscillator frequency divided
by 8). Both PDM signals are 14-bit values. In PDM Mode, the ZSSC3122 must be programmed to Update Mode (see section 10.3.1). Every
time a conversion cycle has finished, the PDM will begin outputting the new value.
An analog output value is created by low-pass filtering the output; a simple first-order RC filter will work in this application.
Select the time constant of the filter based on the requirements for settling time and/or peak-to-peak ripple.
Important: The resistor of the RC filter must be ≥10k.
Table 10.12 shows some filter examples using a 10k resistor.

ZSSC3122 provides high and low clipping limits for the PDM output. EEPROM words PDM_Clip_High and PDM_Clip_Low (EEPROM registers
16HEX and 17HEX; see Table 12.1) are the 14-bit high and low clipping limit registers respectively. The 14-bit values map directly to the output of
the IC and can be calculated as
                                        214 * clip _ level _%
             PDM _Clip  ROUND(                               )                                                           (16)
                                                 100
These registers apply to both PDM_C and PDM_T. Since diagnostics are reported in the PDM pin (see section 10.4), clipping limits allow
diagnostics to be differentiated from the normal output. For detection of the diagnostic signal, a PDM_Clip_High limit of 97.5% (3E66HEX) or
lower is recommended.
Important: The default values for the high and low clipping limits (00HEX) are not compatible with PDM output, so the clipping limits must be
changed if the PDM output is used. Otherwise, the PDM output will not work as expected. If the PDM output is not used, it is important to retain
the default values of 00HEX for the clipping limits.
10.8 Alarm Output
The alarm output can be used to monitor whether a corrected capacitance reading has exceeded or fallen below pre-programmed values. The
alarm can be used to drive an open-drain load connected to VDD, as demonstrated in section 14.2, or it can function as a full push-pull driver.
If a high voltage application is required, external devices can be controlled with the Alarm pins, as demonstrated in section 14.3.
The two alarm outputs can be used at the same time, and these alarms can be used in combination with any of the other three modes; I2C,
SPI, or PDM.
Note: When both PMD_C and PDM_T are selected only Alarm_High is available (see section 10.5).
The alarm outputs are updated when a conversion cycle is completed. The alarm outputs can be used in both Update Mode and Sleep Mode,
but if Sleep Mode is used, I2C or SPI must also be used to control the measurements (see section 10.3).

10.8.1 Alarm Registers
Four registers are associated with the alarm functions: Alarm_High_On, Alarm_High_Off, Alarm_Low_On, and Alarm_Low_Off (see Table 12.1
for EEPROM addresses). Each of these four registers is a 14-bit value that determines where the alarms turn on or off. The two high alarm
registers form the output with hysteresis for the Alarm_High pin, and the two low alarm registers form the output with hysteresis for the
Alarm_Low pin. Each of the two alarm pins can be configured independently using Alarm_Low_Cfg and Alarm_High_Cfg located in EEPROM
word Cust_Config (see Table 12.5 for bit assignments).
Note: If two high alarms or two low alarms are needed, see section 10.8.4.
10.8.2 Alarm Operation
As shown in Figure 10.14, the Alarm_High_On register determines where the high alarm trip point is and the Alarm_High_Off register determines
where the high alarm turns off if the high alarm has been activated. The high alarm hysteresis value is equal to Alarm_High_On –
Alarm_High_Off. The same is true for the low alarm where Alarm_Low_On is the low alarm trip point with Alarm_Low_Off determining the alarm
shut off point. The low alarm hysteresis value is equal to Alarm_Low_Off – Alarm_Low_On. Figure 10.15 shows output operation flowcharts for
both the Alarm_High and Alarm_Low pins.

10.8.3 Alarm Output Configuration
The user can select the output driver configuration for each alarm using the Output Configuration bit in the Alarm_High_Cfg and Alarm_Low_Cfg
registers in EEPROM word Cust_Config (see Table 12.5 for bit assignments). For applications, such as interfacing with a microcontroller or
controlling an external device (as seen in section 14.3), select the full push-pull driver for the alarm output type. For an application that directly
drives a load connected to VDD, as demonstrated in section 14.2, the typical selection is the open-drain output type.
An advantage of making an alarm output open drain is that in a system with multiple devices, the alarm outputs of each ZSSC3122 can be
connected together with a single pull-up resistance so that one can detect an alarm on any device with a single wire.
10.8.4 Alarm Polarity
For both alarm pins, the polarity of the alarm output is selected using the Alarm Polarity bit in the Alarm_High_Cfg and Alarm_Low_Cfg registers
in EEPROM word Cust_Config (see Table 12.5 for bit assignments). As shown in the example in section 14.3, the alarms can be used to drive
a high voltage humidity control system. Since the humidifier or dehumidifier relays must be on when the alarms are on, the alarm polarity bits
are set to 0 (active high). In the example given in section 14.2, an alarm is used to turn on an LED in an open drain configuration. In order for
the LED to be on when the alarm is on, the output must be low, so the alarm polarity bit is set to 1 (active low).
Another feature of the polarity bits is the ability to create two high alarms or two low alarms. For example, with applications requiring two high
alarms, flip the polarity bit of the Alarm_Low pin, and it will act as a high alarm. However, in this case, the effect of the alarm low registers is
also changed: the Alarm_Low_On register would act like the Alarm_High_Off register and the Alarm_Low_Off register would act like the
Alarm_High_On register. The same can be done to achieve two low alarms: the Alarm_High pin would have the polarity bit flipped, and the two
Alarm_High registers would have opposite meanings.

11. Command Mode
Command Mode is primarily used for calibrating the ZSSC3122. Command Mode is entered by sending a Start_CM during the command
window (see section 10.1 for more details on how to enter Command Mode). In Command Mode, a set of commands are available to the user
to calibrate the part (see Table 11.1).
11.1 Command Format
Command Mode commands are only supported for the I2C protocol. As shown in Figure 11.1, commands are 4-byte packets with the first byte
being a 7-bit slave address followed by 0 for write. The second byte is the command byte and the last two bytes form a 16-bit data field.

11.2 Command Encodings
Table 11.1 describes all the commands that are offered in Command Mode.
Note: Only the commands listed in Table 11.1 are valid. Other encodings might cause unpredictable results. If data is not needed for the
command, zeros must be supplied as data to complete the 4-byte packet.

                                           fetch must be performed (see section 10.6.4).
    [a] All time values shown are typical; for the worst case values, multiply by 1.1 (nominal frequency ±10%).
11.3 Command Response and Data Fetch
After a command has been sent and the execution time defined in Table 11.1 has expired, an I2C Data Fetch (DF) can be performed to fetch
the response. As shown in Figure 11.2, after the slave address has been sent, the first byte fetched is the response byte. The upper two status
bits will always be 10BIN to represent Command Mode (see section 10.4). The lower two bits are the response bits.
Table 11.3 describes the different responses that can be fetched. To determine if a command has finished executing, poll the part until a Busy
response is no longer received. The middle four bits of the response byte are command diagnostic bits where each bit represents a different
diagnostic (see Table 11.3). For more information on EEPROM errors see section 10.4.1.
Note: Regardless of what the response bits are, one or more of the diagnostic bits may be set indicating an error occurred during the execution
of the command.
Note: Only one command can be executed at a time. After a command is sent, another command must not be sent until the execution time of
the first command defined in Table 11.1 has expired.

For all commands except EEPROM Read and Get Revision, the data fetch should be terminated after the response byte is read. If the command
was a Get Revision, then the user will fetch a one-byte Revision as shown in Figure 11.2, example 2. The revision is coded with the upper
nibble being the letter corresponding to a full layer change and the lower nibble being the metal change number, for example A0. If the command
was an EEPROM Read, then the user will fetch two more bytes as shown in Figure 11.2, example 3. If a Corrected EEPROM Error diagnostic
was flagged after an EEPROM read, the user has the option to write this data back to attempt to fix the error.
Instead of polling to determine if a command has finished executing, the user can use the Ready pin. In this case, wait for the Ready pin to rise,
which indicates that the command has executed. Then a data fetch can be performed to get the response and data (see Figure 11.2). See
section 10.6.6 for more information on the Ready pin.

12. EEPROM
The EEPROM array contains the calibration coefficients for gain and offset, etc., and the configuration bits for the analog front-end, output
modes, measurement modes, etc. The ZSSC3122 EEPROM is arranged as 32 16-bit words (see Table 12.1). The EEPROM is divided into two
sections. Words 0HEX to 15HEX can only be written to if the EEPROM is unlocked. After the EEPROM is locked, these locations can no longer
be written to. The EEPROM lock bits are in the ZMDI_Config register (see Table 12.2 for the bit assignment). Words 16HEX to 1FHEX (highlighted
blue in Table 12.1) are always unlocked and available to write to at all times. See section 11 for instructions on reading and writing to the
EEPROM in Command Mode via the I2C interface. When programming the EEPROM, an internal charge pump voltage is used; therefore a
high voltage supply is not needed.
Note: If the EEPROM was accidentally locked, it can be unlocked with the following instructions (see section 11 for how to send commands).
1. Enter Command Mode with a Start_CM command.
2. Send an A2HEX for the command byte and 0000HEX for the command data.
3. Send an F0HEX for the command byte and 0021HEX for the command data.
4. Clear the EEPROM_Lock bits in the ZMDI_Config register with an EEPROM Write command.
5. Reset the part.
There are four Customer_ID words available for customer use: two in the locked region and two in the unlocked region. They can be used as a
customer serial number for module traceability. (See Table 12.1 for Customer_ID EEPROM addresses.) The integrity of the contents of the
EEPROM array is ensured via ECC (see section 10.4.1).
Table 12.1 provides a summary of the EEPROM contents. The configuration register bits are explained in detail in the following subsections.

13. Calibration and Signal Conditioning Math
IDT can provide software and hardware with samples to perform the calibration. For a complete description and detailed examples, see the
ZSSC3122/ZSSC3123_SSC_Modular_Evaluation_Kit_Description_RevX_xy.pdf.
Note For best results, the calibration should be done with all settings set to the final application including supply voltage, measurement mode,
update rate, output mode, resolution, and AFE settings in the final packaging.
13.1 Capacitance Signal Conditioning
The ZSSC3122 supports up to a two-region piece-wise, nonlinear sensor input or a third-order correction selectable. The general form of the
capacitance signal conditioning equation is provided below.
Note: The following equations are only meant to show the general form and capabilities of the ZSSC3122 sensor signal conditioning.

for any nonlinearity.

13.3 Limits on Coefficient Ranges
There are range limits on some of the calibration coefficients that will be enforced by the calibration routine provided by IDT. These limits ensure
the integrity of the internal calculations and would only limit the most extreme cases of sensor correction.
Note: For Alarm-only applications, it is critical that the coefficient verification feature of the calibration routine is used since diagnostics are not
reported for the Alarms (see section 10.4 for more details)
Table 13.1 shows the limits for correction for the grade of temperature dependency and 2nd nonlinearity of this dependency.

14. Application Circuit Examples
The ZSSC3122 provides functionality for many different configurations. The following examples correspond to the example circuits shown at
the beginning of the specification; however, there are many other possibilities. Combinations of these examples and many other options can
give the user maximum design flexibility. Settings for the configuration registers are given with each example. See Table 12.1 for register
addresses. In the examples below bits 3 and 4 of the ZMDI_Config register are marked with an X because they are calculated during calibration
and are coefficient dependent (see section 13).
14.1 Digital Output with Optional Alarms
In this example, a single-ended input capacitance is converted to the digital domain, corrected, and output via I2C. The configuration settings
are shown in Table 14.1 below. The ZSSC3122 operates in Sleep Mode, in which measurement commands are used during normal operation.
In this example, the I2C address is 28HEX and the Comm_lock is set.
In this application, both Alarm_High and Alarm_Low are used for digital communication. As shown in Table 14.1 below, both alarms are
configured as active high and full push-pull drivers for digital communication.
The AFE configuration registers select 14-bit resolution for capacitance with a capacitance range from 2.9pF to 7.2pF. The internal temperature
is set to 14-bit resolution.

14.2 Analog Output with Optional Alarms
In this example, a single-ended input capacitance is converted and corrected, and then both capacitance and temperature are output via PDM,
which are then low-pass filtered for analog outputs. One of the optional alarms controls an LED. The configuration settings are shown below in
Table 14.2. In the ZMDI_Config register, the output selection bits are set to 10 to select PDM. Example low-pass filter values are given in
section 10.7.
For PDM, Update Mode must be selected. In this application example, a 25ms power-down period has been used.
In this application, Alarm_High is used to turn on an LED in an open-drain configuration. The output must be low for the LED to be on, so the
Alarm_High polarity bit is set to active low. The PDM clipping limits are set for 10% (666HEX) to 90% (3999HEX) output.
The AFE configuration registers show a resolution of 14 bits for capacitance; however, the PDM low pass filter may be set for a lower resolution
with a faster settling time (see section 10.7). A capacitance range of 1.4pF to 8.6pF has been chosen. The internal temperature is set to 12-bit
resolution.

14.3 Bang-Bang Control System
In this example, the only outputs are the alarm pins. They are programmed to control a high voltage bang-bang humidity control system. External
devices are not needed if not using high voltage.
If the humidity gets too high, the ZSSC3122 activates the dehumidifier using the Alarm_High pin. If the humidity gets too low, it activates the
humidifier with the Alarm_Low pin. The alarm registers must be set to appropriate trip and hysteresis points (see section 10.8). The configuration
settings are shown in Table 14.3.
The output selection bits should either be set to I2C or SPI since depending on the PDM configuration, both alarms are not supported.
Additionally, I2C and SPI are lower power than PDM. This application does not use I2C or SPI, so Update Mode must be used because Sleep
Mode commands cannot be sent. The fastest update rate is used for this example. External devices are needed to control the outputs because
a voltage source greater than VDD is used.

The alarm pins control NMOS devices so the alarm pins must be full push-pull and output high when the alarm is on, so the polarity bits are set
to 0 and the open drain bits are set to 0.
In this example application, a faster response time may be needed, so the AFE configuration settings show 10-bit resolution for both capacitance
and internal temperature. C_Config settings have been selected for a capacitance range of 5.8pF to 7.2pF (see Table 9.1).

14.4 Differential Input Capacitance
This example shows that the full functionality of the ZSSC3122 including the applications illustrated in examples 1, 2, and 3, can be implemented
with a differential input capacitance. The capacitor CCC allows a non-galvanic connection (e.g., to the moving part of a motion sensor as part of
the sensor construction), but it is not needed for sensor types with existing galvanic connections.
The configuration settings are shown in Table 14.4. The differential bit is set to select differential input capacitance. In this example, SPI has
been selected in Update Mode at the fastest update rate. The SPI phase is set to 1 so that the master samples MISO on the negative edge of
SCLK. The EEPROM has been locked.
The AFE configuration registers select 14-bit resolution for capacitance and 10-bit resolution for internal temperature. Because this is the
differential configuration, both the internal reference and offset capacitors are set to zero.

14.5 External Reference Capacitor
This example demonstrates that the full functionality of the ZSSC3122, including the applications illustrated in examples 1, 2, and 3, can be
implemented with an external reference capacitor in conjunction with a single-ended input capacitance. In this example, the digital output is
used. The external reference is used. The configuration settings are shown in Table 14.5.
Example configuration settings show I2C in Sleep Mode with the Comm_lock off so that the ZSSC3122 can respond to any I2C slave address.
Also the Ready pin is configured for open drain so that the Ready lines for multiple devices can be connected together.
The AFE configuration registers select 12-bit resolution for capacitance and 12-bit resolution for internal temperature. This example also shows
an offset setting of 4.3pF.
