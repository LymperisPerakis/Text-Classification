Functional Description
The TLE6212 is a system IC intended for ABS, Traction Control and Electronic Stability Control Systems. It is
especially designed for automotive use. The device is based on Infineon’s power technology SPT4 which allows
bipolar and CMOS control circuitry to be integrated with DMOS power devices on the same monolithic circuitry.
The TLE6212 includes different functions needed for ABS, TC and ESC systems as Wheel Speed Sensor
Interface both for active or passive sensors, multiple supply control for the micro controller and other components
on the PCB, High Side Driver for Pump Motor and Main switch. High voltage enable and general purpose outputs
and K-Line interface is available for off-board communication. A 8 bit SPI interface allows communication and
programming from the micro controller.
For safety reasons a window watchdog / signature watchdog is included. In addition a logic backbone connects
all sub-blocks and its supervision functions to each other and to the SPI communication interface.
