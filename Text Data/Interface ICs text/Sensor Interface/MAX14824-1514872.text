 U = Unknown. These bits are dependent on the DI logic and C/Q inputs.
 The Status register reflects the logic levels of C/Q and DI and shows the source of interrupts that cause an IRQ hardware
 interrupt. The IRQ interrupt is asserted when an alarm condition (OTemp, UV33En, UV24, C/QFault) is detected. All bits in
 the Status register are read-only. The interrupt bits return to the default state after the Status register is read. If a C/Q fault
 condition persists, the C/QFaultInt bit is immediately set after the Status register is read.

          D5                DiLvl           DI Logic Level. The DiLvl bit mirrors the current logic level at the DI input. It is the
                                            inverse of the LI output and is always active regardless of the state of the LiDis bit
                                            (Table 2). DiLvl does not affect IRQ. DiLvl is not changed when the Status register is
                                            read.
          D4                 QLvl           C/Q Logic Level. The QLvl bit is the inverse of the logic level at C/Q. QLvl is 1 when the
                                            C/Q input level is low (< 8V) and is 0 when the C/Q logic level is high (> 13V) (Table 3).
                                            QLvl remains active when the C/Q receiver is disabled (RxDis = 1). QLvl does not affect
                                            IRQ. QLvl is not changed when the Status register is read.

                             the UV33En bit (in the Mode register) are set when VLDO33 falls below the 2.4V LDO33
                             undervoltage threshold. If UV33En is set in the Mode register, IRQ asserts low when the
                             UV33Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV33Int bit and deassert IRQ.
                             Set the UV33En bit to 1 in the Mode register to enable undervoltage monitoring for
                             UV33Int. When enabled, UV asserts high when the UV33Int bit is 1. UV deasserts when
                             VLDO33 rises above the LDO33 undervoltage threshold.
      D1           UV24Int   VCC Undervoltage Interrupt. The UV24Int interrupt bit and the UV24 bit (in the Mode
                             register) are set when the VCC voltage falls below the 7.4V undervoltage threshold. IRQ
                             asserts low when the UV24Int bit is 1. Read the Status register to clear the UV24Int bit
                             and deassert IRQ. VCC undervoltage detection cannot be disabled.
      D0          OTempInt   Overtemperature Warning. The OTempInt interrupt bit and the OTemp bit (in the Mode
                             register) are set when a high-temperature condition is detected by the device. OTemp
                             is set when the temperature of the die exceeds +115NC (typ). OTempInt is set and IRQ
                             asserts when the OTemp bit is 1. The OTempInt bit is cleared and IRQ deasserts when
                             the Status register is read.
                             Once cleared, OTempInt is not reset if the die temperature remains above the thermal

        D7                    RxFilter       C/Q and DI Receiver Filter Control. The C/Q and DI receivers have analog
                                             lowpass filters to reduce high-frequency noise on the receiver inputs. Set the
                                             RxFilter bit to 0 to set the filter corner frequency to 500kHz. Set the RxFilter
                                             bit to 1 to set the filter corner frequency to 1MHz (this setting is used for high-
                                             speed COM3 operation).
                                             Noise filters on C/Q and DI are controlled simultaneously by the RxFilter bit.

                                             COM1 and COM2 operation.
        D5                    C/Q_N/P        C/Q Driver NPN/PNP Mode. The C/Q_N/P bit selects between low-side (NPN)
                                             and high-side (PNP) modes when the C/Q driver is configured as an open-
                                             drain output (C/Q_PP = 0). Set C/Q_N/P to 1 to configure the driver for low-
                                             side (NPN) operation. Set C/Q_N/P to 0 for high-side (PNP) operation.
        D4                    C/Q_PP         C/Q Driver Push-Pull Operation. Set C/Q_PP to 1 to enable push-pull opera-
                                             tion on the C/Q driver. The C/Q output is open drain when C/Q_PP is 0.
        D3                    C/QDEn         C/Q Driver Enable/Disable. Set the C/QDEn bit to 1 to enable the C/Q driver.
                                             Set C/QDEn to 0 for hardware (TXEN) control. See Table 4.
        D2                       Q           C/Q Driver Output Logic. The Q bit can be used to program the C/Q output
                                             driver through software. The C/Q driver must be enabled and TXC = TXQ
                                             must be high to control the C/Q driver through the Q bit (Figure 8). C/Q has
                                             the same logic polarity as the Q bit.
                                             Set the Q bit to 0 to control the C/Q driver with TXC and TXQ.
                                             The C/Q driver output state depends on the C/Q_PP and C/Q_N/P bits as
                                             shown in Table 5. Note that Table 5 assumes that the C/Q driver is enabled
                                             (TXEN = VL or C/QDEn = 1).
        D1                      RxDis        C/Q Receiver Enable/Disable. Set the RxDis bit to 1 to disable the C/Q
                                             receiver. The RX output is high when RxDis is 1.
        D0                   C/QLoad         C/Q Current Sink Enable. Set the C/QLoad bit to 1 to enable the internal cur-
                                             rent sink at C/Q. The C/Q current sink is automatically disabled while the C/Q
                                             driver is enabled (TXEN = high or C/QDEn = 1). This saves power.

                                           set RST to 0 for normal operation.
                                           The Status register is cleared and IRQ deasserts (if asserted) when RST = 1. Interrupts
                                           are not generated while RST = 1.
        D6                  WuEnBit        Auto Wake-Up Polarity Enable. Drive the WUEN input high or set the WuEnBit bit to 1
                                           to enable wake-up generation. When auto wake-up polarity is enabled, the device sam-
                                           ples the logic state of C/Q and uses this as the basis for determining the subsequent
                                           wake-up pulse that is initiated through a high-to-low pulse on the TXQ and TXC inputs.
                                           Set the WuEnBit to 1 before a negative-going, 80µs (typ) wake-up pulse is transmitted to
                                           ensure that the device produces the correct polarity wake-up pulse on the C/Q output.
                                           For example, if C/Q is connected to a voltage high, then it pulls the line low for the wake-
                                           up pulse duration. If C/Q is connected to a voltage low, then it pulls the line high for the
                                           wake-up pulse duration. Clear WuEnBit after the wake-up has been generated (Table 6).

        D3                   UV24          VCC Undervoltage Condition. Both the UV24 and the UV24Int bits are set when VCC
                                           falls below VCCUVLO. UV24 is cleared when VCC rises above the VCC threshold. V5
                                           must be present for VCC undervoltage monitoring.
        D2                  OTemp          Temperature Warning. The OTemp bit is set when a high-temperature condition
                                           occurs on the device. Both the OTempInt interrupt in the Status register and the OTemp
                                           bit are set when the junction temperature of the die rises to above +115NC (typ). The

        D1                  UV33En         LDO33 UV Enable. Set the UV33En bit to 1 to assert the UV output when LDO33 volt-
                                           age falls below the 2.4V (typ) undervoltage lockout threshold. The UV33En bit does
                                           not affect the UV33Int bit in the Status register; IRQ asserts when VLDO33 falls below
