Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.
Note 1: CQEN is connected to V5 with an internal diode. Connecting CQEN to a voltage higher than V5 can result in a large current
             sink until V5 rises above CQEN.

Improved EFT/Burst Resilience
To improve data errors during EFT/burst testing, Maxim
recommends adding a 390pF (typ) capacitor from C/Q to
GND and from C/Q to V24.
