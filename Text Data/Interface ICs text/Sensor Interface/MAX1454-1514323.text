 Conditions
Note  2:   All units are production tested at TA = +25NC and +125NC. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note  3:   Excludes sensor or load current. Analog mode with voltage excitation on BDR pin, FSODAC = 0x8000.
Note  4:   Specification is guaranteed by design.
Note  5:   All electronics temperature errors are compensated together with sensor errors.
Note  6:   The sensor and the device must be at the same temperature during calibration and use.
Note  7:   This is the maximum allowable sensor offset.
Note  8:   This is the sensor’s sensitivity normalized to its drive voltage, assuming a desired full-span output of VDDX - 1V and a
           nominal bridge voltage of VDDX/2.
Note 9: Bit weight is ratiometric to VDDX.
Note 10: Programming of the flash memory at room temperature is recommended.
Note 11: No commands can be executed until the erase operation has completed. During erase operations, all commands sent to
           the device are ignored.
