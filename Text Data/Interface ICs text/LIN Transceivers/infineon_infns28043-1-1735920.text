Description
The TLE7259-3 is a transceiver for the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) with integrated wake-up and protection
features. It is designed for in-vehicle networks using data transmission rates from 2.4 kbps to 20 kbps. The
TLE7259-3 operate as a bus driver between the protocol controller and the physical bus of the LIN network.
Compliant to all LIN standards and with a wide operational supply range the TLE7259-3 can be used in all
automotive applications.
The usage of different operation modes and the INH output allow the TLE7259-3 to control external components,
like e.g. voltage regulators. In Sleep-mode the TLE7259-3 draws typically less than 8 μA of quiescent current while
still being able to wake up when detecting LIN bus traffic and a local wake up signalst. The very low leakage current
on the BUS pin makes the TLE7259-3 especially suitable for partially supplied networks.
Based on the Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT®, the TLE7259-3 provides excellent ESD Robustness and
a very high electromagnetic compliance (EMC). The TLE7259-3 reaches very low levels of electromagnetic
emission within a broad frequency range, independent from the battery voltage. The TLE7259-3 and the Infineon
SPT® technology are AEC qualified and tailored to withstand the harsh condition of the automotive environment.

The LIN Bus is a single wire, bi-directional bus, used for in-vehicle networks. The LIN Transceiver TLE7259-3 is
the interface between the microcontroller and the physical LIN Bus (see Figure 16 and Figure 17). The logical
values of the microcontroller are driven to the LIN bus via the TxD input of the TLE7259-3. The transmit data
stream on the TxD input is converted to a LIN bus signal with optimized slew rate to minimize the EME level of the
LIN network. The RxD output reads back the information from the LIN bus to the microcontroller. The receiver has
an integrated filter network to suppress noise on the LIN Bus and to increase the EMI (Electro Magnetic Immunity)
level of the transceiver.
Two logical states are possible on the LIN bus according to the LIN Specification 2.2A (see Figure 3):
In dominant state, the voltage on the LIN bus is set to the GND level. In recessive state, the voltage on the LIN
bus is set to the supply voltage VS. By setting the TxD input of the TLE7259-3 to “Low” the transceiver generates
a dominant level on the BUS interface pin. The RxD output reads back the signal on the LIN bus and indicates a
dominant LIN bus signal with a logical “Low” to the microcontroller. Setting the TxD pin to “High” the transceiver
TLE7259-3 sets the LIN interface pin BUS to the recessive level, at the same time the recessive level on the LIN
bus is indicated by a logical “High” on the RxD output.
Every LIN network consists of a master node and one or more slave nodes. To configure the TLE7259-3 for master
node applications, a resistor in the range of 1 kΩ and a reverse diode must be connected between the LIN bus
and the power supply VS or the INH pin of the TLE7259-3 (see Figure 16 and Figure 17).

The TLE7259-3 has 3 major operation modes:
•    Stand-By mode
•    Normal Operation mode
•    Sleep mode
The Normal Operation mode contains 2 sub-operation modes, which differentiate by the slew rate control of the
LIN Bus signal (see Figure 4).
Sub-operation modes with different slew rates on the BUS pin:
•    Normal Slope mode, for data transmission rates up to 20 kBaud
•    Flash mode, for programming of the external microcontroller
The operation mode of the TLE7259-3 is selected by the EN pin. (see Figure 4).

1) A pull-up resistor to the external microcontroller supply is required.
2) The TxD input needs an external termination to indicate a “High” or a “Low” signal. The external termination could be a pull-
     up resistor or an active microcontroller output.
4.2             Normal Operation Mode
The TLE7259-3 enters the Normal Operation mode after the microcontroller sets EN to “High” (see Figure 4). In
Normal Operation mode the LIN bus receiver and the LIN bus transmitter are active. Data from the microcontroller
is transmitted to the LIN bus via the TxD pin, the receiver detects the data stream on the LIN bus and forwards it to
the RxD output pin. In Normal Operation mode, the INH pin is “High” (set to VS) and the bus termination is set to
30 kΩ.
Normal Slope mode and the Flash mode are Normal Operation modes and in these sub-modes the behavior of
the INH pin and the bus termination is the same. Per default the TLE7259-3 always enters into Normal Slope
mode, either from Sleep mode or from Stand-By mode. The Flash mode can only be entered from Normal Slope
mode.
In order to avoid any bus disturbance during a mode change, the output stage of the TLE7259-3 is disabled and
set to recessive state during the mode change procedure. To release the TLE7259-3 for data communication on
the LIN bus, the TxD pin needs to be set to “High” for the time tto,rec.

4.2.1             Normal Slope Mode
In Normal Slope mode data transmission rates up to 20 kBauds are possible. Setting the EN pin to “High” starts
the transition to Normal Slope mode. (see Figure 5).
The mode change to Normal Slope mode is defined by the time tMODE. The time tMODE specifies the delay time
between the threshold, where the EN pin detects a “High” input signal, and the actual mode change of TLE7259-
3 into Normal Slope mode. Entering in Normal Operation mode, the TLE7259-3 always enters per default into
Normal Slope mode. The signal on the TxD pin is not relevant for entering into Normal Slope mode.
Finally to release the data communication it is required to set the TxD pin to “High” for the time tto,rec.

4.2.2             Flash Mode
In Flash mode it is possible to transmit and receive LIN messages on the LIN bus. The slew rate control
mechanism of the LIN bus signal is disabled. This allows higher data transmission rates, disregarding the EMC
limitations of the LIN network. The Flash mode is intended to be used during the ECU production for programming
the microcontroller via the LIN bus interface.
The TLE7259-3 can be set to Flash mode only from Normal Slope mode (see Figure 4). Flash mode is entered
by setting the EN pin to “Low” for the time tfl1 and generating a falling and a rising edge at the TxD pin with the
timing tfl2, tfl3 and tfl4 (see Figure 6). Leaving the Flash mode by the same sequence, sets the TLE7259-3 back to
Normal Slope mode. Finally to release the data transmission it is required to set the TxD pin to “High” for the time
tto,rec.
Additionally the TLE7259-3 can leave the Flash mode as well by switching only the EN pin to “Low”. By applying
this “Low” signal to the EN pin the TLE7259-3 is put into Sleep mode.

4.3            Stand-By Mode
The Stand-By mode is entered automatically after:
•   A power-up event at the supply VS.
•   A bus wake-up event at the pin BUS.
•   A local wake-up event at the pin WK.
•   A power on reset caused by power supply VS.
•   In Stand-By mode the Wake-Up sources are monitored by the TxD and RxD pins.
In Stand-By mode no communication on the LIN Bus is possible. The output stage is disabled and the LIN Bus
termination remains activated. The RxD and the TxD pin are used to indicate the wake-up source or a power-up
event. The RxD pin remains “Low“ after a local wake-up event on the pin WK and a bus wake-up event on the LIN
bus. A power-up event is indicated by a logical “High“ on the RxD pin. The signal on the TxD pin indicates the
wake-up source, a weak pull-down signals a bus wake-up event on the LIN bus and a strong pull-down signals a
local wake-up event caused by the WK pin (see Table 1 and Table 2). In order to detect a wake-up event via the
TxD pin, the external microcontroller output needs to provide a logical “High” signal. The wake-up flags indicating
the wake-up source on the pins TxD and RxD are reset by changing the operation mode to Normal Operation
mode.
The signal on the EN pin remains “Low“ due to an internal pull-down resistor. Setting the EN pin to “High“, by the
microcontroller returns the TLE7259-3 to Normal Operation mode. In Stand-By mode the INH output is switching
to VS. The INH output can be used to control external devices like a voltage regulator.

4.4           Sleep Mode
In order to reduce the current consumption the TLE7259-3 offers a Sleep mode. In Sleep mode the quiescent
current on VS and the leakage current on the pin BUS are cut back to a minimum.
To switch the TLE7259-3 from Normal Operation mode to Sleep mode, the EN pin has to be set to “Low”.
Conversely a logical “High” on the EN pin sets the device directly back to Normal Operation mode (see Figure 4).
While the TLE7259-3 is in Sleep mode the following functions are available:
•   The output stage is disabled and the internal bus terminations are switched off (High Impedance on the pin
    BUS). The internal current source on the bus pin ensures that the level on the pin BUS remains recessive and
    protects the LIN network against accidental bus wake-up events.
•   The receiver stage is turned off.
•   RxD output pin is “High” if a pull-up resistor is connected to the external microcontroller supply. The TxD pin is
    disabled. The logical state on the TxD pin is “Low”, due to the internal pull-down resistor.
•   The INH output is switched off and floating.
•   The bus wake-up comparator is active and will cause a transition to Stand-By mode in case of a bus wake-up
    event.
•   The WK pin is active and turns the TLE7259-3 to Stand-By mode in case of a local wake-up.
•   The EN pin remains active, switching the EN pin to “High“ changes the operation mode to Normal Slope mode.
4.5           Wake-Up Events
A wake-up event changes the operation mode of the TLE7259-3 from Sleep mode to Stand-By mode. There are
3 different ways to wake-up the TLE7259-3 from Sleep mode.
•   Bus wake-up via a minimum dominant signal (tWK,bus) on the pin BUS.
•   Local wake-up via a minimum dominant time (tWK) on the WK pin.
•   Mode change from Sleep mode to Normal Operation mode, by setting the EN pin to logical “High”.

Figure 7      Bus Wake-Up behavior
The bus wake-up event, often called remote Wake-Up, changes the operation mode from Sleep mode to Stand-
By mode. A falling edge on the LIN bus, followed by a dominant bus signal t > tWK,bus results in a bus wake-up
event. The mode change to Stand-By mode becomes active with the following rising edge on the LIN bus. The

TLE7259-3 remains in Sleep mode until it detects a change from dominant to recessive on the LIN bus (see
Figure 7).
In Stand-By mode the TxD pin indicates the source of the wake-up event. A weak pull-down on the pin TxD
indicates a bus wake-up event (see Figure 4). The RxD pin signals if a wake-up event occurred or the power-up
event. A “Low” signal on the RxD pin reports a local or bus wake-up event, a logical “High“ signal on RxD indicates
a power-up event.

Figure 8      Local wake-up behavior
Beside the remote wake-up, a wake-up of the TLE7259-3 via the WK pin is possible. This type of wake-up event
is called “Local Wake Up”. A falling edge on the WK pin followed by a “Low“ signal for t > tWK results in a local wake-
up (see Figure 8) and changes the operation mode to Stand-By mode.
In Stand-By mode the TxD pin indicates the source of the Wake-Up event. A strong pull-down on the pin TxD
indicates a local wake-up event (see Figure 4). The RxD pin signals if a wake-up event or the power-up event
occurred. A “Low” signal on the RxD pin reports a local or bus wake-up event, a logical “High“ signal on RxD
indicates a power-up event.

Figure 9      Mode Transition via EN pin
It is also possible to change from Sleep mode to Normal Operation mode by setting the EN pin to logical “High“.
This feature is useful if the external microcontroller is continuously powered, the microcontroller power-supply is
not controlled by the INH pin. The EN pin has an integrated pull-down resistor to ensure the device remains in
Sleep or Stand-By mode even if the voltage on the EN pin is floating. The EN pin has an integrated hysteresis (see
Figure 9).
A transition from logical “High“ to logical “Low“ on the EN pin changes the operation mode from Normal Operation
mode to Sleep mode. If the TLE7259-3 is already in Sleep mode, changing the EN from “Low“ to “High” results
into a mode change from Sleep mode to Normal Operation mode. If the device is in Stand-By mode a change from
“Low“ to “High” on the EN pin changes the mode to Normal Operation mode, as well (see Figure 4).

4.9            TxD Time Out function
If the TxD signal is dominant for a time t > ttimeout the TxD time-out function deactivates the transmission of the LIN
signal to the bus and disables the output stage. This is realized to prevent the bus from being blocked by a
permanent “Low” signal on the TxD pin, caused by an error on the external microcontroller (see Figure 10).
The transmission is released again, after a rising edge at the pin TxD has been detected.
                                                                     Recovery of the

Figure 10      TxD Time-Out function
4.10           Over Temperature protection
The TLE7259-3 has an integrated over temperature sensor to protect the device against thermal overstress on
the output stage. In case of an over temperature event, the temperature sensor will disable the output stage (see
Figure 1). An over temperature event will not cause any mode change and will not be indicated by the RxD pin or
the TxD pin. When the junction temperature falls below the thermal shut down level TJ < TjSD, the output stage is
re-enabled and data communication can start again on the LIN bus. A 10°C hysteresis avoids toggling during the
temperature shut down.
4.11           3.3 V and 5 V Logic Capability
The TLE7259-3 can be used for 3.3 V and 5 V microcontrollers. The inputs and the outputs are capable to operate
with both voltage levels. The RxD output must have an external pull-up resistor to the microcontroller supply to
define the output voltage level.
BUS Short to GND Feature
The TLE7259-3 has a feature implemented to protect the battery from running out of charge in case the LIN bus
is shorted to GND.
In this failure case a normal master termination, a 1 kΩ resistor and diode between the LIN bus and the power
supply VS, would cause a constantly drawn current even in Sleep mode. The resulting resistance of this short to
GND is lower than 1 kΩ. To avoid this current during a generator off state, like in a parked car, the TLE7259-3 has
a bus short to GND feature implemented, which is activated in Sleep mode.

This feature is only applicable, if the master termination of the LIN bus is connected to the INH pin, instead of being
connected to the power supply VS (see Figure 16 and Figure 17). Internally, the 30 kΩ path is also switched off
from the power supply VS (see Figure 1).
A separate Master Termination Switch is implemented at the pin BUS, to avoid a voltage drop on the recessive
level of LIN bus, in case of a dominant level or a short to ground on at the LIN bus.
4.12           LIN Specifications 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.2A
The device fulfills the Physical Layer Specification of LIN 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.2A.
The differences between LIN specification 1.2 and 1.3 is mainly the physical layer specification. The reason was
to improve the compatibility between the nodes.
The LIN specification 2.0 is a super set of the 1.3 version. The 2.0 version offers new features. However, it is
possible to use the LIN 1.3 slave node in a 2.0 node cluster, as long as the new features are not used. Vice versa
it is possible to use a LIN 2.0 node in the 1.3 cluster without using the new features.
In terms of the physical layer the LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 and LIN 2.2A Specification doesn’t include any changes and is
fully compliant to the LIN Specification 2.0.
LIN 2.2A is the latest version of the LIN specification, released in December 2010.

7.1            Compatibility with other Infineon LIN Transceivers
The TLE7259-3 is pin-to-pin compatible with other Infineon LIN transceivers in PG-DSO-8 package (TLE7257SJ
and TLE7258SJ) and in PG-TSON-8 package (TLE7257LE, TLE7258D and TLE7258LE). The only differences
are the pins named N.C (= Not Connected) which can be left open on the PCB in applications where these
functionalities are not needed. The N.C. pins are internally not bonded, so the devices will not be affected if these
pins are connected to signals on the application PCB.

7.3           Master Termination
To achieve the required timings for the dominant to recessive transition of the bus signal an additional external
termination resistor of 1 kΩ is mandatory. It is recommended to place this resistor at the master node. To avoid
reverse currents from the bus line into the battery supply line it is recommended to place a diode in series with the
external pull-up. For small systems (low bus capacitance) the EMC performance of the system is supported by an
additional capacitor of at least 1 nF at the master node (see Figure 16 and Figure 17).The values for the Master
Termination resistor and the bus capacitances influence the performance of the LIN network. They depend on the
number of nodes inside the LIN network and on the parasitic cable capacitance of the LIN bus wiring.
7.4           External Capacitors
A capacitor of 10 μF at the supply voltage input VS buffers the input voltage. In combination with the required
reverse polarity diode this prevents the device from detecting a power down conditions in case of negative
transients on the supply line (see Figure 16 and Figure 17).
The 100 nF capacitor close to the VS pin of the TLE7259-3 is required to get the best EMC performance.
