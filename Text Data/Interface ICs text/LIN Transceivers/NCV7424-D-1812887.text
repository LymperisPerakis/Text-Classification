NCV7424
Four Channel LIN
Transceiver
  NCV7424 is a four channel physical layer device using the Local
Interconnect Network (LIN) protocol. It allows interfacing of four
independent LIN physical buses and the LIN protocol controllers. The
device is compliant to LIN 2.x Protocol Specification package and the                   www.onsemi.com
SAE J2602 standard.
  The NCV7424 LIN device is a member of the in-vehicle networking
(IVN) transceiver family. The device is a monolithic solution                              16
incorporating 4 times the NCV7321-1 transceiver.

1. Below 5 V on VBB in normal mode, the bus will either stay recessive or comply with the voltage level specifications and transition time
   specifications as required by SAE J2602. It is ensured by the battery monitoring circuit. Above 27 V on VBB, LIN communication is operational
   (LIN pin toggling) but parameters cannot be guaranteed. For higher battery voltage operation above 27 V, LIN pull-up resistor must be
   selected large enough to avoid clamping of LIN pin by voltage drop over external pull-up resistor and LIN pin min current limitation.
2. Equivalent to discharging a 100 pF capacitor through a 1.5 kW resistor.
3. Equivalent to discharging a 150 pF capacitor through a 330 W resistor. System HBM levels are verified by an external test−house.
