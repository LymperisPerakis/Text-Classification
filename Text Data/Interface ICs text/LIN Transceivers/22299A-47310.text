(see Figure 1-14). The microcontroller will set the I/O
pin to control the CS/LWAKE. An external switch, or
other source, can then wake-up both the transceiver
and the microcontroller.
   Note:      CS/LWAKE should NOT be tied directly to
              pin VREG as this could force the
              MCP2050 into Operation Mode before the
              microcontroller is initialized.
1.3.8         FAULT/TXE
Fault Detect Output/Transmitter Enable Input pin. The
output section is HV tolerant open drain (up to 30V).
The input section is identical with TXD section (TTL
level, HV compliant, adaptive pull-up). Internal
adaptive pull-up maintains this input high '1' if the pin is
floating. Its state is defined as shown in Table 1-3. The
device is placed in TRANSMITTER OFF mode
whenever this pin is LOW (‘0’), either from an internal
fault condition or by external drive.
If CS/LWAKE is HIGH (‘1”), the FAULT/TXE signals a
mismatch between the TXD input and the LBUS level.
This can be used to detect a bus contention. Since the
bus exhibits a propagation delay, the sampling of the
internal compare is debounced to eliminate false faults.
After the device wakes up, the FAULT/TXE indicates
what wakes the device if CS/LWAKE remains LOW (‘0’)
(refer to Table 1-3).
The FAULT/TXE pin sampled at a rate faster than every
10 µs.
1.3.9          RESET
RESET OUTPUT pin. This pin is open drain with
~90 kΩ pull-up to VREG. It indicates the internal
voltage has reached a valid, stable level. As long as the
internal voltage is valid (above 0.8VREG), this pin will
remain HIGH (‘1’); otherwise the RESET pin switches
to LOW (‘0’).
1.3.10         WWDTRESET
WWDTRESET is an open-drain output pin. This pin is
asserted low when the internal Windowed Watchdog
Timer has expired or an attempt was made to clear the
timer before the window has opened.

VOFF when the device is turned on.
The current peak at start-up (due to the fast charge of
the CREG and CBAT capacitor) may induce a significant
drop on the VBB pin. This drop is proportional to the
impedance of the VBAT connection (see Figure 1-14).
Assume that the VBAT connection is mainly inductive
and resistive and that the customer knows the resistive
and inductive values of the connection.
The following formula gives an indication of the mini-
mum value the customer should use for CBAT:

       Note 1: CREG, the load capacitor, should be ceramic or tantalum rated for extended temperatures,
                  1.0-22 µF. See Figure 2-1 for selecting the correct ESR.
             2: CBAT is the filter capacitor for the external voltage supply. It’s typically 10 * CREG, with no ESR
                  restriction. See Figure 1-13 to select the minimum recommended value for CBAT. The RTP value is
                  added to the line resistance.

1.8     ICSP™ Considerations
The following should be considered when the
MCP2050 is connected to pins supporting in-circuit
programming:
• Power used for programming the microcontroller
  can be supplied from the programmer, or from the
  MCP2050.
• The voltage on the pin VREG should not exceed
  the maximum value of VREG as shown in Section
  2.3 “DC Specifications”.

 Note 1:    The maximum power dissipation is a function of TJMAX, ΘJA and ambient temperature TA. The maximum
            allowable power dissipation at an ambient temperature is PD = (TJMAX - TA) ΘJA. If this dissipation is
            exceeded, the die temperature will rise above 150°C and the MCP2050 will go into thermal shutdown.

NOTES:
DS22299A-page 42 © 2012 Microchip Technology Inc.


 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
