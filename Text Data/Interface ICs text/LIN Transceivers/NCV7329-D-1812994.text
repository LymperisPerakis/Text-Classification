NCV7329
Stand-alone LIN Transceiver
Description
   The NCV7329 is a fully featured local interconnect network (LIN)
transceiver designed to interface between a LIN protocol controller
and the physical bus.
   The LIN bus is designed to communicate low rate data from control
                                                                                          www.onsemi.com

lowest possible cost. The bus is designed to eliminate as much wiring
as possible and is implemented using a single wire in each node. Each                                            MARKING

All voltages are referenced to GND (pin 5) unless otherwise specified. Positive currents flow into the IC. Sinking current means
the current is flowing into the pin; sourcing current means the current is flowing out of the pin.
