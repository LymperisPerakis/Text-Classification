HALO’s Commitment to Long Term Availability
The transceiver chip inside of the HALO TnT module is the H83C92. Over the years, the IC industry has either discontin-
ued or announced End of Life (EOL) of the 83C92 ICs traditionally used in Thinnet applications. The IEEE802.3 compliant
H83C92 transceiver chip has been developed by HALO to provide long term availability of the TnT module family.

  HALO’s “TNT” Thin Net Transceiver Modules
                                                “TNT” Application Notes
1. The HALO Electronics “TNT” family of modules is available with 3.3V, 5V, 8V or 12V input voltages. Care should be
taken to connect the module to the correct supply voltage.
                                                                                                                         -
                                                                                                                      -
3. RXI and TXO (Pins 17 and 18) must be tied together externally at the BNC connector. The 1N916 diode is contained
within the TNT module.
4. For repeater applications, the SQE Test (Heartbeat Test) must be disabled. This is accomplished by connecting Pin 16
(HBE) to Pin 11 (VEE). For non-repeater applications Pin 16 (HBE) should be connected to isolated ground (CDS). It is not
                                                                                                                       -
mum capacitor is also recommended for safety considerations.
6. The TNT module should be located as close to the BNC connector as possible. This will assure the lowest shunt ca-
pacitance. IEEE 802.3 requires a maximum of 8pF shunt capacitance. Please see paragraph 10.6.3 and Appendix C3.
7. A de-coupling capacitor between VCC and GND is helpful to minimize noise on the supply line.
8. Additional surge protection components are recommended for applications where higher voltage static surge is a
concern. Please contact the factory for additional information.
