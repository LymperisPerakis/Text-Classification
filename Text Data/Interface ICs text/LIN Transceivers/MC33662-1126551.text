LIN Physical Layer                                                                                 33662
   The Local Interconnect Network (LIN) is a serial communication
protocol, designed to support automotive networks in conjunction with
a Controller Area Network (CAN). As the lowest level of a hierarchical
network, LIN enables cost-effective communication with sensors and
actuators when all the features of CAN are not required.                                            LINCELL
   The three 33662 versions are designed to operate at different
maximum baud rates. The 33662LEF and 33662BLEF, and the
33662SEF and 33662BSEF, offer a normal baud rate (20 kbps), and
the 33662JEF and 33662BJEF, a slow baud rate (10 kbps). They
integrate a fast baud rate (above 100 kbps), as reported by the RXD pin
for test and programming modes. They provide excellent EMC
(Electromagnetic Compatibility) and Radiated Emission performance,
ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) robustness, and safe behavior, in the
event of a LIN bus short-to-ground, or a LIN bus leakage during low-
power mode. This device is powered by SMARTMOS technology.

    Notes
       1. In Sleep mode, the total module current consumption may be higher than expected if the external pull-up resistor on the RxD pin
           is implemented. There may be an unexpected glitch on RxD as INH goes low.

   2. Class A: All functions of a device/system perform as designed during and after exposure to disturbance.
   3. Class D: At least one function of the transceiver stops working properly during the test, and will return to proper operation automatically
        when the exposure to the disturbance has ended. No physical damage of the IC occurs.

Notes
   6. Parameters guaranteed for 7.0 V VSUP  18 V.
   7.   Voltage range at the battery level, including the reverse battery diode.
   8.   Loss of local ground must not affect communication in the residual network.
   9.   Node has to sustain the current that can flow under this condition. The bus must remain operational under this condition.
  10.   LIN threshold for a dominant state.
  11.   LIN threshold for a recessive state.
  12.   This parameter is guaranteed by process monitoring but not production tested.
  13.   When an overtemperature shutdown occurs, the LIN transmitter and receiver are in recessive state and INH switched off. This parameter
        is tested with a test mode on ATE and characterized at laboratory.
