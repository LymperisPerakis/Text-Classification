1. Description
   Atmel® ATA6629/ATA6631 is a fully integrated LIN transceiver, designed according to the LIN specification 2.0, 2.1 and
   SAEJ2602-2, with a low-drop voltage regulator (3.3V/5V/85mA). The combination of voltage regulator and bus transceiver
   makes it possible to develop simple, but powerful, slave nodes in LIN bus systems. ATA6629/ATA6631 is designed to
   handle the low-speed data communication in vehicles (for example, in convenience electronics). Improved slope control at
   the LIN driver ensures secure data communication up to 20kBaud. The bus output is designed to withstand high voltage.
   Sleep mode and silent mode guarantee minimized current consumption even in the case of a floating or a short circuited
   LIN-bus.

3.  Functional Description
3.1 Physical Layer Compatibility
    Since the LIN physical layer is independent from higher LIN layers (e.g., LIN protocol layer), all nodes with a LIN physical
    layer according to revision 2.x can be mixed with LIN physical layer nodes, which are according to older versions (i.e., LIN
    1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3) without any restrictions.
3.2 Supply Pin (VS)
    LIN operating voltage is VS = 5V to 27V. An undervoltage detection is implemented to disable transmission if VS falls below
    5V, in order to avoid false bus messages. After switching on VS, the IC starts with the fail-safe mode and the voltage
    regulator is switched on.
    The supply current in sleep mode is typically 10µA and 35µA in silent mode.
3.3 Ground Pin (GND)
    The IC does not affect the LIN bus in the event of GND disconnection. It is able to handle a ground shift up to 11.5% of VS.
3.4 Voltage Regulator Output Pin (VCC)
    The internal 3.3V/5V voltage regulator is capable of driving loads up to 85mA, supplying the microcontroller and other ICs on
    the PCB and is protected against overload by means of current limitation and overtemperature shut-down. Furthermore, the
    output voltage is monitored and will cause a reset signal at the NRES output pin if it drops below a defined threshold Vthun.
3.5 Undervoltage Reset Output (NRES)
    If the VCC voltage falls below the undervoltage detection threshold Vthun, NRES switches to low after tres_f
    (Figure 6-1 on page 15). Even if VCC = 0V the NRES stays low, because it is internally driven from the VS voltage. If VS
    voltage ramps down, NRES stays low until VS < 1.5V and then becomes highly resistant.
    The implemented undervoltage delay keeps NRES low for tReset = 4ms after VCC reaches its nominal value.
3.6 Bus Pin (LIN)
    A low-side driver with internal current limitation and thermal shutdown as well as an internal pull-up resistor according to LIN
    specification 2.x is implemented. The voltage range is from –27V to +40V. This pin exhibits no reverse current from the LIN
    bus to VS, even in the event of a GND shift or VBatt disconnection. The LIN receiver thresholds are compatible with the LIN
    protocol specification.
    The fall time (from recessive to dominant) and the rise time (from dominant to recessive) are slope controlled.
3.7 Input/Output (TXD)
    In normal mode the TXD pin is the microcontroller interface to control the state of the LIN output. TXD must be pulled to
    ground in order to drive the LIN bus low. If TXD is high or unconnected (internal pull-up resistor), the LIN output transistor is
    turned off and the bus is in the recessive state. During fail-safe mode, this pin is used as output and is signalling the fail-safe
    source.
3.8 Dominant Time-out Function (TXD)
    The TXD input has an internal pull-up resistor. An internal timer prevents the bus line from being driven permanently in the
    dominant state. If TXD is forced to low longer than tDOM > 27ms, the LIN bus driver is switched to the recessive state.
    Nevertheless, when switching to sleep mode, the actual level at the TXD pin is relevant.
    To reactivate the LIN bus driver, switch TXD to high (> 10µs).
4   ATA6629/ATA6631 [DATASHEET]
    9165F–AUTO–10/14


3.9  Output Pin (RXD)
     This pin reports the state of the LIN bus to the microcontroller. LIN high (recessive state) is reported by a high level at RXD;
     LIN low (dominant state) is reported by a low level at RXD. The output has an internal pull-up resistor with typically 5kΩ to
     VCC. The AC characteristics are measured with an external load capacitor of 20pF.
     The output is short-circuit protected. In unpowered mode (that is, VS = 0V), RXD is switched off.
3.10 Enable Input Pin (EN)
     The enable input pin controls the operation mode of the device. If EN is high, the circuit is in normal mode, with transmission
     paths from TXD to LIN and from LIN to RXD both active. The VCC voltage regulator operates with 3.3V/5V/85mA output
     capability.
     If EN is switched to low while TXD is still high, the device is forced to silent mode. No data transmission is then possible, and
     the current consumption is reduced to IVS typ. 35µA. The VCC regulator has its full functionality.
     If EN is switched to low while TXD is low, the device is forced to sleep mode. No data transmission is possible, and the
     voltage regulator is switched off.

4.1 Normal Mode
    This is the normal transmitting and receiving mode of the LIN interface, in accordance with LIN specification 2.x. The VCC
    voltage regulator operates with a 3.3V/5V output voltage, with a low tolerance of ±2% and a maximum output current of
    85mA.
    If an undervoltage condition occurs, NRES is switched to low and the IC changes its state to fail-safe mode.

4.2 Silent Mode
    A falling edge at EN while TXD is high switches the IC into silent mode. The TXD signal has to be logic high during the mode
    select window (Figure 4-3 on page 8). The transmission path is disabled in silent mode. The overall supply current from VBatt
    is a combination of the IVSsilent = 35µA plus the VCC regulator output current IVCC.

  A falling edge at the LIN pin followed by a dominant bus level maintained for a certain time period (> tbus) and the following
  rising edge at pin LIN (see Figure 4-3) results in a remote wake-up request which is only possible if TXD is high. The device
  switches from silent mode to fail-safe mode, then the internal LIN slave termination resistor is switched on. The remote
  wake-up request is indicated by a low level at pin RXD and TXD to interrupt the microcontroller (Figure 4-3). EN high can be
  used to switch directly to normal mode.

4.3 Sleep Mode
    A falling edge at EN while TXD is low switches the IC into sleep mode. The TXD signal has to be logic low during the mode
    select window (Figure 4-5 on page 10).

                                                      LIN switches directly to recessive mode
    In order to avoid any influence to the LIN-pin during switching into sleep mode it is possible to switch the EN up to 3.2µs
    earlier to low than the TXD. Therefore, the best an easiest way are two falling edges at TXD and EN at the same time.
    In sleep mode the transmission path is disabled. Supply current from VBatt is typically IVSsleep = 10µA. The VCC regulator is
    switched off; NRES and RXD are low. The internal slave termination between pin LIN and pin VS is disabled to minimize the
    current consumption in case pin LIN is short-circuited to GND. Only a weak pull-up current (typically 10µA) between pin LIN
    and pin VS is present. The sleep mode can be activated independently from the current level on pin LIN.
    A voltage less than the LIN pre-wake detection VLINL at pin LIN activates the internal LIN receiver and starts the wake-up
    detection timer.
    A falling edge at the LIN pin followed by a dominant bus level maintained for a certain time period (> tbus) and a following
    rising edge at pin LIN results in a remote wake-up request. The device switches from sleep Mode to fail-safe mode.
    The VCC regulator is activated, and the internal LIN slave termination resistor is switched on. The remote wake-up request is
    indicated by a low level at RXD and TXD to interrupt the microcontroller (Figure 4-5 on page 10).
    EN high can be used to switch directly from sleep/silent to fail-safe mode. If EN is still high after VCC ramp up and
    undervoltage reset time, the IC switches to normal mode.

4.4 Sleep or Silent Mode: Behavior at a Floating LIN-bus or a Short Circuited LIN to GND
    In sleep or in silent mode the device has a very low current consumption even during short-circuits or floating conditions on
    the bus. A floating bus can arise if the master pull-up resistor is missing, e.g., if it is switched off when the LIN- master is in
    sleep mode or even if the power supply of the master node is switched off.
    In order to minimize the current consumption IVS in sleep or silent mode during voltage levels at the LIN-pin below the LIN
    pre-wake threshold, the receiver is activated only for a specific time tmon. If tmon elapses while the voltage at the bus is lower
    than pre-wake detection low (VLINL) and higher than the LIN dominant level, the receiver is switched off again and the circuit
    changes back to sleep respectively silent mode. The current consumption is then IVSsleep_short or IVSsilent_short (typ. 10µA more
    than IVSsleep respectively IVSsilent). If a dominant state is reached on the bus no wake-up will occur. Even if the voltage rises
    above the pre-wake detection high (VLINH), the IC will stay in sleep respectively silent mode (see Figure 4-6 on page 11).
    This means the LIN-bus must be above the pre-wake detection threshold VLINH for a few microseconds before a new LIN
    wake-up is possible.

    If the Atmel® ATA6629/ATA6631 is in sleep or silent mode and the voltage level at the LIN-bus is in dominant state
    (VLIN < VBUSdom) for a time period exceeding tmon (during a short circuit at LIN, for example), the IC switches back to sleep
    mode respectively silent mode. The VS current consumption then is IVSsleep_short or IVSsilent_short (typ. 10µA more than IVSsleep
    respectively IVSsilent). After a positive edge at pin LIN the IC switches directly to fail-safe mode (see Figure 4-7 on page 12).

4.5 Fail-safe Mode
    The device automatically switches to fail-safe mode at system power-up. The voltage regulator is switched on
    (see Figure 6-1 on page 15). The NRES output switches to low for tres = 4ms and gives a reset to the microcontroller. LIN
    communication is switched off. The IC stays in this mode until EN is switched to high. The IC then changes to normal mode.
    A power down of VBatt (VS < VSth) during silent or sleep mode switches the IC into fail-safe mode after power up. A low at
    NRES switches the IC into fail-safe mode directly. During fail-safe mode the TXD pin is an output and signals the fail-safe
    source.
    The LIN SBC can operate in different modes, like normal, silent or sleep mode. The functionality of these modes is described
    in Table 4-2.

      A wake-up event from either silent or sleep mode will be signalled to the microcontroller using the two pins RXD and TXD.
      The coding is shown in Table 4-3.
      A wake-up event will lead the IC to the fail-safe mode.

4.6   Unpowered Mode
      If you connect battery voltage to the application circuit, the voltage at the VS pin increases according to the block capacitor
      (see Figure 6-1 on page 15). After VS is higher than the VS undervoltage threshold VSth, the IC mode changes from
      unpowered mode to fail-safe mode. The VCC output voltage reaches its nominal value after tVCC. This time, tVCC, depends
      on the VCC capacitor and the load.
      The NRES is low for the reset time delay treset. During this time, treset, no mode change is possible.
      IF VS drops below VSth, then the IC switches to unpowered mode. The behaviour of VCC, NRES and LIN is shown in
      Figure 4-8.

5. Fail-safe Features
     ●    During a short-circuit at LIN to VBattery , the output limits the output current to IBUS_LIM. Due to the power dissipation, the
          chip temperature exceeds TLINoff and the LIN output is switched off. The chip cools down and after a hysteresis of Thys,
          switches the output on again. RXD stays on high because LIN is high. During LIN overtemperature switch-off, the VCC
          regulator is working independently.
     ●    During a short-circuit from LIN to GND the IC can be switched into sleep or Silent mode and even in this case the
          current consumption is lower than 30µA in sleep mode and lower than 70µA in silent mode. If the short-circuit
          disappears, the IC starts with a remote wake-up.
     ●    Sleep or silent mode: During a floating condition on the bus the IC switches back to sleep mode/silent mode
          automatically and thereby the current consumption is lower than 30µA/70µA.
     ●    The reverse current is < 2µA at pin LIN during loss of VBatt . This is optimal behavior for bus systems where some
          slave nodes are supplied from battery or ignition.
     ●    During a short circuit at VCC, the output limits the output current to IVCClim. Because of undervoltage, NRES switches
          to low and sends a reset to the microcontroller. The IC switches into fail-safe mode. If the chip temperature exceeds
          the value TVCCoff, the VCC output switches off. The chip cools down and after a hysteresis of Thys, switches the output
          on again. Because of fail-safe mode, the VCC voltage will switch on again although EN is switched off from the
          microcontroller.The microcontroller can then start with normal operation.
     ●    Pin EN provides a pull-down resistor to force the transceiver into recessive mode if EN is disconnected.
     ●    Pin RXD is set floating if VBatt is disconnected.
     ●    Pin TXD provides a pull-up resistor to force the transceiver into recessive mode if TXD is disconnected.
     ●    After switching the IC into normal mode the TXD pin must be pulled to high longer than 10µs in order to activate the
          LIN driver. This feature prevents the bus from being driven into dominant state when the IC is switched into normal
          mode and TXD is low.
     ●    If TXD is short-circuited to GND, it is possible to switch to sleep mode via ENABLE after t > tdom.

     The voltage regulator needs an external capacitor for compensation and to smooth the disturbances from the
     microcontroller. It is recommended to use an electrolytic capacitor with C > 1.8µF and a ceramic capacitor with C = 100nF.
     The values of these capacitors can be varied by the customer, depending on the application.
     With this special SO8 package (fused lead frame to pin 3) an Rthja of 80K/W is achieved.
     Therefore, it is recommended to connect pin 3 with a wide GND plate on the printed board to get a good heat sink.
     The main power dissipation of the IC is created from the VCC output current IVCC, which is needed for the application.
