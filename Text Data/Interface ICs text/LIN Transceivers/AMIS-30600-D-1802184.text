AMIS-30600
LIN Transceiver
General Description
   The single−wire transceiver AMIS−30600 is a monolithic integrated
circuit in a SOIC−8 package. It works as an interface between the
protocol controller and the physical bus.
   The AMIS−30600 is especially suitable to drive the bus line in LIN                                http://onsemi.com
systems in automotive and industrial applications. Further it can be
used in standard ISO9141 systems.
   In order to reduce the current consumption the AMIS−30600 offers                                  PIN ASSIGNMENT
a stand−by mode. A wake−up caused by a message on the bus pulls the
INH−output high until the device is switched to normal operation
mode.

   The transceiver is implemented in I2T100 technology enabling both
high−voltage analog circuitry and digital functionality to co−exist on
