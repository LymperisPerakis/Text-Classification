                  Quad LIN 2.2A/SAE J2602 transceiver
                  Rev. 1 — 12 February 2015                                        Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1024 is a quad LIN transceiver that provides the interface between a Local
              Interconnect Network (LIN) master/slave protocol controller and the physical bus in a LIN
              network. It comprises two independent and separated dual LIN transceiver blocks on a
              single die (only the ground pins GND1 and GND2 are connected internally) with dedicated
              supply pins (VBAT1 for LIN 1/LIN2 and VBAT2 for LIN3/LIN4).
              The TJA1024 is primarily intended for in-vehicle subnetworks using baud rates up to
              20 kBd and is compliant with LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A and SAE J2602. The
              TJA1024 is software compatible with the TJA1022, TJA1027 and TJA1029.
              The transmit data streams generated by the protocol controller are converted by the
              TJA1024 into optimized bus signals shaped to minimize ElectroMagnetic Emissions
              (EME). The LIN bus output pins are pulled HIGH via internal termination resistors. For a
              master application, an external resistor in series with a diode should be connected
              between pin VBATx and the respective LIN pins. The receivers detect receive data streams
              on the LIN bus input pins and transfer them via pins RXDx to the microcontroller.
              Power consumption is very low when all four transceivers are in Sleep mode. However,
              the TJA1024 can still be woken up via pins LINx and SLPx_N.

7. Functional description
                       The TJA1024 is the interface between the LIN master/slave protocol controller and the
                       physical bus in a LIN network. According to the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model,
                       this interface is the LIN physical layer.
                       The LIN transceivers are optimized for, but not limited to, automotive applications with
                       excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance.
                   7.1 LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 compliant
                       The TJA1024 is fully LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A and SAE J2602 compliant. The
                       LIN physical layer is independent of higher OSI model layers (e.g. the LIN protocol).
                       Consequently, nodes containing a LIN 2.2A-compliant physical layer can be combined,
                       without restriction, with LIN physical layer nodes that comply with earlier revisions
                       (LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3, LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1 and LIN 2.2).
                   7.2 Operating modes
                       The transceivers are fully operational in Normal mode. A low-power Sleep mode is also
                       supported, as well as a Reset mode. Standby mode facilitates the transition between
                       Sleep and Normal modes.
                       The transceivers operate independently (except in Reset mode; see Section 7.2.4), so
                       one transceiver can be in Normal mode while another is in Sleep or Standby etc. Power
                       consumption is at a minimum when all four transceivers are in Sleep mode.
                7.2.1 Normal mode
                       In Normal mode, the TJA1024 can transmit and receive data via the LIN bus lines. The
                       transceivers operate independently, so one can be active while the others are off.
                       A transceiver switches from Sleep or Standby mode to Normal mode if SLPx_N is held
                       HIGH for tgotonorm. If SLPx_N is held LOW for tgotosleep, the transceiver switches from
                       Normal to Sleep mode.
                       The receivers detect data streams on the LIN bus lines (via pins LINx) and transfer the
                       input via pins RXDx to the microcontroller (see Figure 6): HIGH for a recessive level and
                       LOW for a dominant level on the bus. The receivers have supply-voltage related
                       thresholds with hysteresis and integrated filters to suppress bus line noise.
                       Transmit data streams from the protocol controller are detected on the TXDx pins and are
                       converted by the transmitters into optimized bus signals shaped to minimize EME. The
                       LIN bus output pins are pulled HIGH via internal slave termination resistors. For a master
                       application, an external resistor in series with a diode should be connected between pin
                       VBATx and the appropriate LINx pin (see Figure 6).

        (1) A positive edge on SLPx_N triggers a transition to Normal mode in the corresponding LIN transceiver; the LIN transmitter is
            enabled once TXDx goes HIGH. In the event of thermal shutdown, the transceivers in the affected dual transceiver block are
            shut down (each block has its own temperature detection so the other two transceivers are not affected).
        (2) Power dissipation is at a minimum when all four transceivers are in Sleep mode.
        (3) When a transceiver switches to Standby mode in response to a LIN bus wake-up event, the associated RXDx pin will be LOW
            to indicate which LIN channel was the source of the wake-up request.

                    7.2.2 Sleep mode
                               A transceiver will switch to Sleep mode from Normal mode if SLPx_N is held LOW for
                               tgotosleep. The relevant LIN transmit path is disabled as soon as SLPx_N goes LOW.
                               Power consumption is very low when all four transceivers are in Sleep mode.
                               The voltage levels on LINx and TXDx have no effect on a transition to Sleep mode. So the
                               transceiver switches to Sleep mode even if TXDx is held LOW or there is a continuous
                               dominant level on LINx (e.g. due to a short circuit to ground).
                               Although current consumption is extremely low when all four transceivers are in Sleep
                               mode, the TJA1024 can still be woken up remotely via the LIN bus pins or by the
                               microcontroller via pins SLPx_N. Filters on the receiver inputs (LIN1 to LIN4) and on pins
                               SLPx_N prevent unwanted wake-up events occurring due to automotive transients or

                                                                                                                Quad LIN 2.2A/SAE J2602 transceiver
                      radio frequency interference. To be valid, all wake-up events must be maintained for a
                      specific length of time (twake(dom)LIN for a remote wake-up and tgotonorm for a wake-up via
                      SLPx_N). Pin RXDx is floating when a transceiver is in Sleep mode.
                      If a remote wake-up event (see Figure 4) is detected on one of the LIN bus lines, the
                      associated transceiver switches to Standby mode. A wake-up initiated by the
                      microcontroller (SLPx_N HIGH for tgotonorm) will cause the relevant transceiver to switch to
                      Normal mode while the other transceivers remains in their current state.
                7.2.3 Standby mode
                      Standby mode is an intermediate mode between Sleep and Normal modes. A transceiver
                      switches from Sleep mode to Standby mode in response to a LIN bus wake-up event. Pin
                      RXDx goes low to indicate the source of the remote wake-up to the microcontroller (LIN1,
                      LIN2, LIN3 or LIN4). A transceiver switches from Standby to Normal mode if the
                      microcontroller holds SLPx_N HIGH for tgotonorm.
                7.2.4 Reset mode
                      When the voltage on VBATx drops below the LOW-level power-on reset threshold,
                      Vth(POR)L, the associated dual transceiver block (LIN1/LIN2 and/or LIN3/LIN4) switches to
                      Reset mode. All input signals are ignored and all output drivers are off for the affected
                      transceivers. When the voltage on VBATx rises again above the HIGH-level power-on reset
                      threshold, Vth(POR)H, the transceivers switch to Sleep mode.

                      [3]  RXDx is LOW to indicate the source of the remote wake-up request; RXDx goes HIGH in response to a
                           positive edge on pin SLPx_N.
                      [4]  A positive edge on SLPx_N triggers a transition to Normal mode; the transmitter will be off if TXDx is LOW
                           and will be enabled as soon as TXDx goes HIGH.

                7.3.1 Remote wake-up via the LIN bus

                       a rising edge on pin LINx triggers a remote wake-up (see Figure 4). It should be noted that
                       the time period twake(dom)LIN is measured either in Normal mode while TXDx is HIGH, or in
                       Sleep mode irrespective of the status of pin TXDx.

                7.3.2 Wake-up via SLPx_N
                       If SLPx_N is held HIGH for tgotonorm, the transceiver switches from Sleep mode to Normal
                       mode.
                   7.4 Operation during automotive cranking pulses
                       TJA1024 remains fully operational during automotive cranking pulses because the LIN
                       transceivers are fully specified down to VBATx = 5 V.
                   7.5 Operation when supply voltage is outside specified operating range
                       If VBAT1 and/or VBAT2 > 18 V or < 5 V, the respective dual transceiver block may remain
                       operational, but parameter values cannot be guaranteed to remain within the operating
                       ranges specified in Table 7 and Table 8 for the relevant transceiver block (LIN1/LIN2 or
                       LIN3/LIN4).
                       In Normal mode:
                         • If the input level on pin TXDx is HIGH, the LIN transmitter output on pin LINx will be
                            recessive.
                         • If the input level on pin LINx is recessive, the receiver output on pin RXDx will be
                            HIGH.
                         • If the voltage on pin VBATx rises to 27 V (e.g. during an automotive jump-start), the
                            total LIN network pull-up resistance should be greater than 680  and the total LIN
                            network capacitance should be less than 6.8 nF to ensure reliable LIN data transfer.
                         • If the voltage on pin VBATx drops below the LOW-level VBAT LOW threshold,
                            Vth(VBATL)L, the active LIN transmit path(s) is interrupted and both associated LIN
                            outputs will be recessive. The previously active LIN transmit path(s) is switched on
                            again when VBATx rises above Vth(VBATL)H and pin TXDx is HIGH.

                       If the voltage on pin VBATx drops below the LOW-level power-on reset threshold, Vth(POR)L,
                       the associated transceivers switch to Reset mode (i.e. the output drivers are disabled and
                       the inputs are ignored). When the voltage on VBATx rises again above Vth(POR)H, the
                       transceivers will switch to Sleep mode.
                   7.6 Fail-safe features
                       Pin TXDx is pulled down to ground in order to force a predefined level on the transmit data
                       input if the pin is disconnected.
                       Pin SLPx_N is pulled down to ground to ensure that the transceiver is forced to Sleep x
                       mode if SLPx_N is disconnected.
                       Pins RXD1 and RXD2 are set floating if VBAT1 is disconnected. Pins RXD3 and RXD4 are
                       set floating if VBAT2 is disconnected.
                       The current in the transmitter output stage is limited to protect the transmitter against short
                       circuits to pins VBATx or GNDx.
                       A loss of power (pins VBATx and GNDx) has no impact on the bus lines or on the
                       microcontroller. No reverse currents flow from the bus lines into the LINx pins. The current
                       path from VBATx to LINx via the integrated LIN slave termination resistors remains. The
                       TJA1024 can be disconnected from the power supply without influencing the LIN buses.
                       The output drivers on pins LIN1, LIN2, LIN3 and LIN4 are protected against
                       overtemperature conditions. If the junction temperature at one of the transceiver blocks
                       exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), the thermal protection circuit disables
                       the relevant output drivers (LIN1/LIN2 or LIN3/LIN4). The drivers are enabled again when
                       the junction temperature falls below Tj(sd) and pin TXDx is HIGH.
                       The initial TXD dominant check prevents the bus being driven to a permanent dominant
                       state (blocking all network communications) if pin TXDx is forced permanently LOW by a
                       hardware and/or software application failure. The input level on TXDx is checked after a
                       transition to Normal mode. If TXDx is LOW, the transmit path remains disabled and is only
                       enabled when TXDx goes HIGH.
                       Once the transmitter has been enabled, a TXD dominant time-out timer is started every
                       time pin TXDx goes LOW. If the LOW state on pin TXDx persists for longer than the TXD
                       dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus line to
                       recessive state. The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXDx goes HIGH.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 8) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 10 and 11

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 8.
