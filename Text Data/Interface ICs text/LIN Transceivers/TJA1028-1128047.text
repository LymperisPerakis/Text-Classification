                  Rev. 4 — 25 July 2012                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1028 is a LIN 2.0/2.1/SAE J2602 transceiver with an integrated low-drop voltage
              regulator. The voltage regulator can deliver up to 70 mA and is available in 3.3 V and
              5.0 V variants. TJA1028 facilitates the development of compact nodes in Local
              Interconnect Network (LIN) bus systems. To support robust designs, the TJA1028 offers
              strong ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) performance and can withstand high voltages on the
              LIN bus. In order to minimize current consumption, the TJA1028 supports a Sleep mode
              in which the LIN transceiver and the voltage regulator are powered down while still having
              wake-up capability via the LIN bus.
              The TJA1028 comes in an SO8 package, and also in a 3 mm  3 mm HVSON8 package
              that reduces the required board space by over 70 %. This feature can prove extremely
              valuable when board space is limited.

7. Functional description
                       The TJA1028 combines the functionality of a LIN transceiver and a voltage regulator in a
                       single chip and offers wake-up by bus activity. The voltage regulator is designed to power
                       the Electronic Control Unit’s (ECU) microcontroller and its peripherals.
                       The LIN transceiver is the interface between a LIN master/slave protocol controller and
                       the physical bus in a LIN network. According to the Open System Interconnect (OSI)
                       model, these modules make up the LIN physical layer.

                                                                                         LIN transceiver with integrated voltage regulator
                       The TJA1028T/xxx/20 and TJA1028TK/xxx/20 versions are optimized for a transmission
                       speed of 20 kBd, the maximum specified in the LIN standard. The TJA1028T/xxx/10 and
                       TJA1028TK/xxx/10 versions are optimized for a transmission speed of 10.4 kBd, as
                       specified in SAE J2602. All versions achieve optimum ElectroMagnetic Compatibility
                       (EMC) performance by wave shaping the LIN output.
                   7.1 LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 compliant
                       The TJA1028 is fully LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 and SAE J2602 compliant. Since the LIN
                       physical layer is independent of higher OSI model layers (e.g. the LIN protocol), nodes
                       containing a LIN 2.2-compliant physical layer can be combined, without restriction, with
                       LIN physical layer nodes that comply with earlier revisions (i.e. LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2,
                       LIN 1.3, LIN 2.0 and LIN 2.1).
                   7.2 Operating modes
                       The TJA1028 supports four operating modes: Normal, Standby, Sleep and Off. The
                       operating modes, and the transitions between modes, are illustrated in Figure 3.

                                                                                         LIN transceiver with integrated voltage regulator
                7.2.1 Off mode
                       The TJA1028 switches to Off mode from all other modes if the battery supply voltage
                       drops below the power-off detection threshold (Vth(det)poff) or the junction temperature
                       exceeds the overtemperature protection activation threshold (Tth(act)otp).
                       The voltage regulator and the LIN physical layer are disabled in Off mode, and pin RSTN
                       is forced LOW.
                7.2.2 Standby mode
                       Standby mode is a low-power mode that guarantees very low current consumption.
                       The TJA1028 switches from Off mode to Standby mode as soon as the battery supply
                       voltage rises above the power-on detection threshold (VBAT > Vth(det)pon), provided the
                       junction temperature is below the overtemperature protection release threshold
                       (Tvj < Tth(rel)otp).
                       The TJA1028 switches to Standby mode from Normal mode during the mode select
                       window if TXD is HIGH and EN is LOW (see Section 7.2.5), provided RSTN = 1.
                       A remote wake-up event will trigger a transition to Standby mode from Sleep mode. The
                       remote wake-up event will be signalled by a continuous LOW level on pin RXD.
                       In Standby mode, the voltage regulator is on, the LIN physical layer is disabled and
                       remote wake-up detection is active. The wake-up source is indicated by the level on RXD
                       (LOW indicates a remote wake-up).
                7.2.3 Normal mode
                       If the EN pin is pulled HIGH while the TJA1028 is in Standby mode (with RSTN = 1) or
                       Sleep mode, the device will enter Normal mode. The LIN physical layer and the voltage
                       regulator are enabled in Normal mode.
               7.2.3.1 The LIN transceiver in Normal mode
                       The LIN transceiver is activated when the TJA1028 enters Normal mode.
                       In Normal mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via the LIN bus. The
                       receiver detects data streams on the LIN pin and transfers them to the microcontroller via
                       pin RXD. LIN recessive is represented by a HIGH level on RXD, LIN dominant by a LOW
                       level.
                       The transmit data streams of the protocol controller at the TXD input are converted by the
                       transmitter into bus signals with optimized slew rate and wave shaping to minimize EME.
                       A LOW level at the TXD input is converted to a LIN dominant level while a HIGH level is
                       converted to a LIN recessive level.
                7.2.4 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode features extremely low power consumption.
                       The TJA1028 switches to Sleep mode from Normal mode during the mode select window
                       if TXD and EN are both LOW (see Section 7.2.5), provided RSTN = 1.
                       The voltage regulator and the LIN physical layer are disabled in Sleep mode. Pin RSTN is
                       forced LOW. Remote wake-up detection is active.

                7.2.5 Transition from Normal to Sleep or Standby mode
                       When EN is driven LOW in Normal mode, the TJA1028 disables the transmit path. The
                       mode select window opens tmsel(min) after EN goes LOW, and remains open until tmsel(max)
                       after EN goes LOW (see Figure 4).
                       The TXD pin is sampled in the mode select window. A transition to Standby mode is
                       triggered if TXD is HIGH, or to Sleep mode if TXD is LOW.
                       To avoid complicated timing in the application, EN and TXD can be pulled LOW at the
                       same time without having any effect on the LIN bus. In order to ensure that the remote
                       wake-up time (twake(dom)LIN) is not reset on a transition to Sleep mode, TXD should be
                       pulled LOW at least td(EN-TXD) after EN goes LOW. This is guaranteed by design.
                       The user must ensure the appropriate level is present on pin TXD while the mode select
                       window is open.

                                   TXD is sampled during the mode select window. The TJA1028 switches to Standby (TXD HIGH) or
                                   Sleep (TXD LOW) mode after sampling.

                   7.3 Power supplies
                7.3.1 Battery (pin VBAT)
                       The TJA1028 contains a single supply pin, VBAT. An external diode is needed in series to
                       protect the device against negative voltages. The operating range is from 4.5 V to 28 V.
                       The TJA1028 can handle voltages up to 40 V (max). If the voltage on pin VBAT falls below
                       Vth(det)poff, the TJA1028 switches to Off mode, shutting down the internal logic and the
                       voltage regulator and disabling the LIN transmitter. The TJA1028 exits Off mode as soon
                       as the voltage rises above Vth(det)pon, provided the junction temperature is below Tth(rel)otp.
                7.3.2 Voltage regulator (pin VCC)
                       The TJA1028 contains a voltage regulator supplied via pin VBAT, which delivers up to
                       70 mA. It is designed to supply the microcontroller and its periphery via pin VCC.

                                                                                         LIN transceiver with integrated voltage regulator
                7.3.3 Reset (pin RSTN)
                       The output voltage on pin VCC is monitored continuously and a system reset signal is
                       generated (pin RSTN goes LOW) if an undervoltage event is detected (VCC < Vuvd for
                       tdet(uv)(VCC)). Pin RSTN will go HIGH again once the voltage on VCC exceeds the
                       undervoltage recovery threshold (Vuvr) for trst.
                   7.4  LIN transceiver
                       The transceiver is the interface between a LIN master/slave protocol controller and the
                       physical bus in a LIN network. It is primarily intended for in-vehicle sub-networks using
                       baud rates from 2.4 kBd up to 20 kBd and is LIN 2.0/LIN 2.1/SAE J2602 compliant.
                   7.5 Remote wake-up
                       A remote wake-up is triggered by a falling edge on pin LIN, followed by LIN remaining
                       LOW for at least twake(dom)LIN, followed by a rising edge on pin LIN (see Figure 5).
                                                                        LIN recessive                                         VBAT

                         Fig 5.     Remote wake-up behavior
                       The remote wake-up request is communicated to the microcontroller in Standby mode by
                       a continuous LOW level on pin RXD.
                       Note that twake(dom)LIN is measured in Sleep and Standby modes, and in Normal mode if
                       TXD is HIGH.
                   7.6 Fail-safe features
                7.6.1 General fail-safe features
                       The following general fail-safe features have been implemented:
                         • An internal pull-up towards VCC on pin TXD guarantees a recessive bus level if the pin
                             is left floating by a bad solder joint or floating microcontroller port pin.
                         • The current in the transmitter output stage is limited in order to protect the transmitter
                             against short circuits to pin VBAT.
                         • A loss of power (pins VBAT and GND) has no impact on the bus line or on the
                             microcontroller. There will be no reverse currents from the bus.
                         • The LIN transmitter is automatically disabled when either EN or RSTN is LOW.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                  TJA1028
                                                                                             LIN transceiver with integrated voltage regulator
                              • After a transition to Normal mode, the LIN transmitter is only enabled if a recessive
                                  level is present on pin TXD.
                  7.6.2 TXD dominant time-out function
                            A TXD dominant time-out timer circuit prevents the bus line being driven to a permanent
                            dominant state (blocking all network communications) if TXD is forced permanently LOW
                            by a hardware or software application failure. The timer is triggered by a negative edge on
                            the TXD pin. If the pin remains LOW for longer than the TXD dominant time-out time
                            (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, driving the bus line to a recessive state. The timer
                            is reset by a positive edge on TXD.
                  7.6.3 Temperature protection
                            The temperature of the IC is monitored in Normal, Standby and Off modes. If the
                            temperature is too high (Tvj > Tth(act)otp), the TJA1028 will switch to Off mode (if in Standby
                            or Normal modes). The voltage regulator and the LIN transmitter will be switched off and
                            the RSTN pin driven LOW.
                            When the temperature falls below the overtemperature protection release threshold
                            (Tvj < Tth(rel)otp), the TJA1028 switches to Standby mode.

14. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                15.3 Wave soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 8 and 9

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.
