                  timeout
                  Rev. 3 — 18 December 2018                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1029 is the interface between the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) master/slave
              protocol controller and the physical bus in a LIN network. It is primarily intended for
              in-vehicle subnetworks using baud rates up to 20 kBd and is compliant with LIN 2.0,
              LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, SAE J2602 and ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V). The TJA1029 is
              pin-compatible with the TJA1020, TJA1021, TJA1022, TJA1027 and MC33662(B).
              The protocol controller generates the transmit data stream. The TJA1029 converts the
              data stream into an optimized bus signal shaped to minimize ElectroMagnetic Emissions
              (EME). The LIN bus output pin is pulled HIGH via an internal termination resistor. For a
              master application, connect an external resistor in series with a diode between pin VBAT
              and pin LIN. The receiver detects a receive data stream on the LIN bus input pin and
              transfers it via pin RXD to the microcontroller.
              Power consumption is very low in Sleep mode. However, the TJA1029 can still be woken
              up via pins LIN and SLP_N. An integrated TXD dominant time-out function prevents the
              bus being driven to a permanent dominant state.

                                       ISO 17987/LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 transceiver with TXD dominant timeout
7. Functional description
                       The TJA1029 is the interface between the LIN master/slave protocol controller and the
                       physical bus in a LIN network. According to the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model,
                       this interface makes up the LIN physical layer.
                       The LIN transceiver is optimized for, but not limited to, automotive applications with
                       excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance.
                   7.1 LIN 2.x/ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V)/SAE J2602 compliant
                       The TJA1029 is fully LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, SAE J2602 and
                       ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V) compliant. The LIN physical layer is independent of higher OSI
                       model layers (e.g. the LIN protocol). Consequently, nodes containing an
                       ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V) compliant physical layer can be combined, without restriction,
                       with LIN physical layer nodes that comply with earlier revisions (LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2,
                       LIN 1.3, LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 and LIN 2.2A).
                   7.2 Operating modes
                       The TJA1029 supports modes for normal operation (Normal mode) and very-low-power
                       operation (Sleep mode). An intermediate wake-up mode between Sleep and Normal
                       modes is also supported (Standby mode). The state diagram is shown in Figure 3.

                                       ISO 17987/LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 transceiver with TXD dominant timeout
                7.2.1 Reset mode
                      When the TJA1029 is in Reset mode, it ignores all input signals and all output drivers are
                      off. The TJA1029 switches to Reset mode when the voltage on VBAT drops below the
                      LOW-level power-on reset threshold, Vth(POR)L. When the voltage on VBAT rises above the
                      HIGH-level power-on reset threshold, Vth(POR)H, the TJA1029 switches to Sleep mode.
                7.2.2 Sleep mode
                      The TJA1029 consumes significantly less power in Sleep mode than in Normal mode.
                      Even though current consumption is extremely low in Sleep mode, the TJA1029 can still
                      be woken up remotely via pin LIN or activated directly via pin SLP_N. Filters on the
                      receiver input (LIN) and on pin SLP_N prevent unwanted wake-up events occurring due to
                      automotive transients or radio frequency interference. All wake-up events must be
                      maintained for a specific period (twake(dom)LIN or tgotonorm).
                      A falling edge on pin SLP_N in Normal mode initiates a transition to Sleep mode. The LIN
                      transmit path is immediately disabled when pin SLP_N goes LOW. In order to ensure the
                      TJA1029 switches successfully to Sleep mode, the sleep command (pin SLP_N = LOW)
                      must be maintained for at least tgotosleep.
                      Sleep mode activation is independent of the levels on pins LIN or TXD. So the lowest
                      possible power consumption can be guaranteed, even when there is a continuous
                      dominant level on pins LIN and TXD.
                7.2.3 Standby mode
                      Standby mode is activated automatically when a local or remote wake-up event occurs
                      while the TJA1029 is in Sleep mode. In Standby mode, pin RXD is held LOW to provide
                      an interrupt flag for the microcontroller.
                7.2.4 Normal mode
                      In Normal mode, the TJA1029 can transmit and receive data via the LIN bus.
                      The receiver detects the data stream on the LIN bus input pin and transfers it via pin RXD
                      to the microcontroller (see Figure 6): HIGH for a recessive level and LOW for a dominant
                      level on the bus. The receiver has a supply-voltage related threshold with hysteresis and
                      an integrated filter to suppress bus line noise.
                      The transmitter converts the transmit data stream from the protocol controller, detected on
                      pin TXD, into an optimized bus signal. The optimized bus signal is shaped to minimize
                      EME. The LIN bus output pin is pulled HIGH via an internal slave termination resistor. For
                      a master application, connect an external resistor in series with a diode between pin VBAT
                      and pin LIN (see Figure 6).
                      If pin SLP_N is pulled HIGH while the TJA1029 is in Sleep or Standby mode, the LIN
                      transceiver switches to Normal mode after tgotonorm.

                       A falling edge on pin LIN, followed by a LOW level maintained for twake(dom)LIN, followed by
                       a rising edge on pin LIN, triggers a remote wake-up (see Figure 4). Note that the time
                       period twake(dom)LIN is measured either in Normal mode while TXD is HIGH, or in Sleep
                       mode irrespective of the status of pin TXD.

                7.3.2 Wake-up via pin SLP_N
                       If SLP_N is held HIGH for tgotonorm, the TJA1029 switches from Sleep mode to Normal
                       mode.
                   7.4 Operation during automotive cranking pulses
                       TJA1029 remains fully operational during automotive cranking pulses because the LIN
                       transceiver is fully specified down to VBAT = 5 V.
                   7.5 Operation when supply voltage is outside specified operating range
                       If VBAT > 18 V or VBAT < 5 V, the TJA1029 may remain operational, but parameter values
                       cannot be guaranteed to remain within the operating ranges specified in Table 7 and
                       Table 8.
                       If the voltage on pin VBAT drops below the LOW-level power-on reset threshold, Vth(POR)L,
                       the TJA1029 switches to Reset mode. All output drivers are disabled and all inputs are
                       ignored. The TJA1029 switches to Sleep mode if VBAT > Vth(POR)H.
                       In Normal mode:
                         • If the input level on pin TXD is HIGH, the LIN transmitter output on pin LIN will be
                            recessive.
                         • If the input level on pin LIN is recessive, the receiver output on pin RXD will be HIGH.
                         • If the voltage on pin VBAT rises to 27 V (e.g. during an automotive jump-start), the total
                            LIN network pull-up resistance should be greater than 680  and the total LIN network
                            capacitance should be less than 6.8 nF to ensure reliable LIN data transfer.

                                         ISO 17987/LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 transceiver with TXD dominant timeout
                         • If the voltage on pin VBAT drops below the LOW-level VBAT LOW threshold, Vth(VBATL)L,
                            the LIN transmit path is interrupted and the LIN output remains recessive. The LIN
                            transmit path is switched on again when VBAT rises above Vth(VBATL)H and the input to
                            pin TXD is recessive.
                   7.6 TXD dominant time-out function
                       An initial TXD dominant check prevents the bus line being driven to a permanent
                       dominant state (blocking all network communications) if pin TXD is forced permanently
                       LOW by a hardware and/or software application failure. The TXD input level is checked
                       after a transition to Normal mode. If TXD is LOW, the transmit path remains disabled and
                       is only enabled when TXD goes HIGH.
                       Once the transmitter has been enabled, a TXD dominant time-out timer is started every
                       time pin TXD goes LOW. If the LOW state on pin TXD persists for longer than the TXD
                       dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus line to
                       recessive state. The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD goes HIGH.
                   7.7 Fail-safe features
                       A pull-down to GND on pin TXD forces a predefined level on the transmit data input if the
                       pin is disconnected.
                       A pull-down to GND on pin SLP_N forces the transceiver into Sleep mode if pin SLP_N is
                       disconnected.
                       Pin RXD is set floating if VBAT is disconnected.
                       The current in the transmitter output stage is limited in order to protect the transmitter
                       against short circuits to pins VBAT or GND.
                       A loss of power (pins VBAT and GND) has no impact on the bus line or on the
                       microcontroller. No reverse currents flow from the bus into pin LIN. The current path from
                       VBAT to LIN via the integrated LIN slave termination resistor remains. The LIN transceiver
                       can be disconnected from the power supply without influencing the LIN bus.
                       The output driver on pin LIN is protected against overtemperature conditions. If the
                       junction temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), the thermal
                       protection circuit disables the output driver. The driver is enabled again when the junction
                       temperature falls below Tj(sd) and pin TXD is recessive.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 9) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 10 and 11

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 9.
