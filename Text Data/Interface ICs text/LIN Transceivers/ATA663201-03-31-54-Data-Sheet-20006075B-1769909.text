1.0       FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
1.1       Physical Layer Compatibility
Since the LIN physical layer is independent of higher
LIN layers (e.g., LIN protocol layer), all nodes with a
LIN physical layer according to revision 2.x can be
mixed with LIN physical layer nodes based on earlier
versions (i.e., LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3) without
any restrictions.

The device can distinguish between different wake-up
sources. The wake-up source can be read on the TXD
and RXD pin in Fail-Safe mode. These flags are
immediately reset if the microcontroller sets the EN pin
to high and the IC is in Normal mode.

The current consumption of the SBC in Silent mode or
in Fail-Safe mode and the one of the voltage regulator
is always below 170 μA, even when the supply voltage
VVS is lower than the regulator’s nominal output voltage
VVCC.

The voltage regulator needs an external capacitor for
compensation and to smooth the disturbances from the
microcontroller. It is recommended to use a MLC
capacitor with a minimum capacitance of 1.8 μF
together with a 100 nF ceramic capacitor. Depending
on the application, the values of these capacitors can
be modified by the customer.
During a short circuit at VCC, the output limits the
output current to IVCClim. Because of undervoltage,
NRES switches to low and sends a reset to the
microcontroller. If the chip temperature exceeds the
value TVCCoff, the VCC output switches off. The chip
cools down and, after a hysteresis of Thys, switches the
output on again.
When the ATA663201/03/31/54 in the 8-Lead VDFN
package is being soldered onto the Printed Circuit
Board (PCB) it is mandatory to connect the heat slug
with a wide GND plate on the printed board to get a
good heat sink.
The main power dissipation of the IC is created from
the VCC output current IVCC, which is needed for the
application.
Figure 1-12 shows the safe operating area of the
ATA663201/03/31/54 in the 8-Lead VDFN package.

              (SBC ONLY)
The enable input pin controls the operating mode of the
device. If EN is high, the circuit is in Normal mode, with
transmission paths from TXD to LIN and from LIN to
RXD both active. The VCC voltage regulator operates
with 3.3V/5V/85 mA output capability.
If EN is switched to low while TXD is still high, the
device is forced to Silent mode. No data transmission
is then possible, and current consumption is reduced to
IVSsilent typical 47 µA. The VCC regulator retains its full
functionality.
If EN is switched to low while TXD is low, the device is
forced to Sleep mode. No data transmission is possible
and the voltage regulator is switched off.
The EN pin provides a pull-down resistor to force the
transceiver into Recessive mode if EN is disconnected.

1.6.5        GROUND PIN (GND)
The IC does not affect the LIN bus in the event of GND
disconnection. It is able to handle a ground shift of up
to 11.5% of VVS.
1.6.6        BUS PIN (LIN) (SBC ONLY)
A low-side driver with internal current limitation and
thermal shutdown as well as an internal pull-up resistor
according to LIN specification 2.x is implemented. The
voltage range is from -27V to +40V. This pin exhibits no
reverse current from the LIN bus to VS, even in the
event of a GND shift or VBat disconnection. The LIN
receiver thresholds comply with the LIN protocol
specification.
The fall time (from recessive to dominant) and the rise
time (from dominant to recessive) are slope-controlled.
During a short circuit at LIN to VBat, the output limits the
output current to IBUS_LIM. Due to the power
dissipation, the chip temperature exceeds TLINoff and
the LIN output is switched off. The chip cools down and
after a hysteresis of Thys, switches the output on again.
RXD stays on high because LIN is high. The VCC
regulator     works      independently       during     LIN
overtemperature switch-off.
During a short circuit from LIN to GND, the IC can be
switched into Sleep or Silent mode and even in this
case the current consumption is lower than 100 µA in
Sleep mode and lower than 120 µA in Silent mode. If
the short-circuit disappears, the IC starts with a remote
wake-up.

NOTES:
DS20006075B-page 34  2019 Microchip Technology Inc.


 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
