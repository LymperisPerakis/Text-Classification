Description
                                                                                          PG-TSON-8
The TLE7257 is a transceiver for the Local Interconnect Network (LIN)
with integrated wake-up and protection features. It is designed for in-
vehicle networks using data transmission rates up to 20 kbps. The TLE7257 operate as a bus driver between the
protocol controller and the physical bus of the LIN network. Compliant to all LIN standards and with a wide
operational supply range the TLE7257 can be used in all automotive applications.
The usage of different operation modes and the INH output allows the TLE7257 to control external components
like e.g. voltage regulators. In Sleep mode the TLE7257 draws typically less than 10 μA of quiescent current while
still being able to wake-up when detecting LIN bus traffic. The very low leakage current on the BUS pin makes the
TLE7257 especially suitable for partially supplied networks.
Based on the Infineon BiCMOS technology the TLE7257 provides excellent ESD robustness together with a very
high electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). The TLE7257 reaches a very low level of electromagnetic emission
(EME) within a broad frequency range and independent from the battery voltage. The TLE7257 is AEC qualified
and tailored to withstand the harsh conditions of the automotive environment.

The LIN interface is a single wire, bi-directional bus, used for in-vehicle networks. The TLE7257 LIN transceiver
is the interface between the microcontroller and the physical LIN Bus (see Figure 16). Data from the
microcontroller is driven to the LIN bus via the TxD input of the TLE7257. The transmit data stream on the TxD
input is converted to a LIN bus signal with optimized slew rates in order to minimize the electromagnetic emission
level of the LIN network. The RxD output reads back the information from the LIN bus to the microcontroller. The
receiver has an integrated filter network to suppress noise from the LIN bus and to increase the electromagnetic
immunity level of the transceiver.
The LIN specification defines two valid bus states (see Figure 3):
•   “Dominant” state with the LIN bus voltage level near GND.
•   “Recessive” state with the LIN bus voltage pulled up to the supply voltage VS through the bus termination.
By setting the TxD input of the TLE7257 to a logical “low” signal, the transceiver generates a “dominant” level on
the BUS interface pin. The receiver reads back the signal on the LIN bus and indicates the “dominant” LIN bus
signal with a logical “low” level on the RxD output to the microcontroller. By setting the TxD input to logical “high”,
the transceiver sets the LIN interface pin to the “recessive” level. At the same time the “recessive” level on the LIN
bus is indicated by a logical “high” level on the RxD output.
Every LIN network consists of a master node and one or more slave nodes. To configure the TLE7257 for master
node applications, a termination resistor of 1 kΩ and a diode must be connected between the LIN bus and the
power supply VS (see Figure 16).

4.2             Normal Operation Mode
While operating in Normal Operation mode the LIN bus receiver and transmitter are active and support data
transmission rates up to 20 kbps. Data from the microcontroller is transmitted to the LIN bus via the TxD input.
Simultaneously the receiver detects the data stream on the LIN bus and forwards it to the RxD output.
Normal Operation mode can be entered from either Sleep mode (see Figure 9) or from Standby mode (see
Figure 5), by setting the EN input to logical “high”. From Normal Operation mode the TLE7257 can only enter
Sleep mode, it is not possible to enter Standby mode directly (see Figure 4).
The transition time for mode change to Normal Operation mode tMODE specifies the delay between the threshold,
where the EN pin detects a “high” input signal, and the actual mode change of TLE7257 to Normal Operation
mode.

                                                                                                        TLE7257
                                                                                           Functional Description
While the TLE7257 is in Normal Operation mode the following functions are available:
•   The transmitter is turned on; data on the TxD input are driven on the LIN bus.
•   The receiver is turned on; data on the LIN bus are monitored and signaled on the RxD output.
•   The BUS pin is terminated to VS via the internal termination resistor RBUS (see Figure 1).
•   The TxD input is pulled up via a current source to the internal power supply of the TLE7257.
•   The INH output is switched on.
•   The bus wake-up comparator is turned off.
•   The two-level undervoltage detection is active. In case VS drops below the undervoltage detection level the
    TLE7257 blocks the transmitter and receiver. In case VS drops below the power-on reset level VS,UV,PON the
    TLE7257 changes the operation mode to Standby mode after recovery (see “Undervoltage Detection” on
    Page 15).
•   The EN input is active. A “low” signal on the EN input triggers a transition to Sleep.
After a mode change to Normal Operation the TLE7257 requires a logical “high” signal for the time tto,rec on the
TxD input before releasing the data communication (see Figure 5). The transmitter remains deactivated as long
as the signal on the TxD input remains logical “low”, preventing possible bus communication disturbance.
4.3          Standby Mode
The Standby mode is entered automatically after bus wake-up event.
In Standby mode no communication to the LIN bus is possible. The transmitter and the receiver are disabled.
While the TLE7257 is in Standby mode the following functions are available:
•   The transmitter is turned off, the TxD input is inactive and the bus output is permanent “recessive”.
•   The receiver is turned off.
•   The RxD output indicates a wake-up event (see Figure 4 and Table 1).
•   The BUS pin is terminated to VS via the internal termination resistor RBUS (see Figure 1).
•   The TxD input is pulled up with a current source to the internal power supply of the TLE7257.
•   The INH output is switched on.
•   In Standby mode only the power-on reset level of the undervoltage detection is active (see “Undervoltage
    Detection” on Page 15).
•   The EN input is active. A “high” signal on the EN input triggers a transition to Normal Operation mode (see

4.4            Sleep Mode
Sleep mode is a low power mode with quiescent current consumption reduced to a minimum while the device is
still able to wake-up by a message on the LIN bus.
After a power-up event the TLE7257 enters Sleep mode by default. The EN pin has an internal pull-down resistor
and the TLE7257 remains in Sleep mode until the external microcontroller applies a logical “high” signal at the EN
input.
To switch the TLE7257 from Normal Operation mode to Sleep mode, the EN input has to be set to “low”.
Conversely a logical “high” signal on the EN input sets the device directly back to Normal Operation mode (see
Figure 4). The TLE7257 can only enter Sleep mode from Normal Operation mode.

Figure 6       Entering Sleep mode from Normal Operation mode
While the TLE7257 is in Sleep mode the following functions are available:
•    The transmitter is turned off.
•    The receiver is turned off.
•    The BUS output is terminated to VS via the internal termination resistor RBUS (see Figure 1).
•    The RxD output is “high” if a pull-up resistor is connected to the external microcontroller supply.
•    The TxD input is disabled and the internal pull-up current source is switched off.
•    The INH output is switched off and is floating.
•    The bus wake-up comparator is active and will cause transition to Standby mode in case of a wake-up event.
•    In Sleep mode only the power-on reset level of the undervoltage detection is active (see “Undervoltage
     Detection” on Page 15).
•    The EN input remains active. A “high” signal on the EN input triggers a transition to Normal Operation mode.

Figure 8       Bus wake-up behavior
A bus wake-up event, also called remote wake-up, changes the operation mode from Sleep mode to Standby
mode. A falling edge on the LIN bus, followed by a “dominant” bus signal for the time tWK,bus results in a bus wake-
up event. The mode change to Standby mode becomes active with the following rising edge on the LIN bus. The
TLE7257 remains in Sleep mode until it detects a state change on the LIN bus from “dominant” to “recessive” (see
Figure 8).
In Standby mode a logical “low” signal on the RxD output indicates a bus wake-up event.

Figure 9           Entering Normal Operation mode from Sleep mode
The EN input is used for operation mode control of the TLE7257. By setting the EN input logical “high” for the time
tMODE while being Sleep or Standby mode, a transition to Normal Operation mode will be triggered (see Figure 9).
The EN input has an integrated pull-down resistor to ensure the device remains in Sleep or Standby mode even
if the EN pin is left open. The EN input has an integrated hysteresis.
A signal transition from logical “high” to “low” on the EN input changes the operation mode from Normal Operation
mode to Sleep mode (see Figure 5).
The TLE7257 changes the operation modes regardless of the signal on the BUS pin. In the case of a short circuit
between the LIN bus and GND, resulting in a permanent “dominant” signal, the TLE7257 can be set to Sleep mode
by setting the EN input to logical “low”.
After a mode change to Normal Operation mode, a logical “high” signal for the time tto,rec on the TxD input is
required to release the data communication.

4.7           Over-Temperature Protection
The TLE7257 has an integrated over-temperature sensor to protect the device against thermal overstress on the
transmitter. In case of an over-temperature event, the transmitter will be disabled (see Figure 10). An over-
temperature event will not cause any mode change and will not be directly indicated on the RxD output or the TxD
input.
When the junction temperature falls below the thermal shut down level TJ < TJSD, the transmitter will be
reactivated. After an over-temperature recovery the TxD input requires a logical “high” signal before restarting data
transmission.
A 10°C hysteresis avoids toggling during the temperature shut down.

Figure 11    Early undervoltage detection
The TLE7257 has undervoltage detection on the VS supply pin with two different thresholds:
•  In Normal Operation mode the TLE7257 blocks the communication between the LIN bus and the
   microcontroller when detecting undervoltage events. However, no mode change will occur. After VS rises
   above the undervoltage release level VS,UV,REL, the bus communication interface will be released when the
   signal on the TxD input goes “high”. See Figure 11.
•  In case the VS power supply drops down below the power-on reset level VS,UV,PON the TLE7257 blocks the
   communication between the LIN bus and the microcontroller, and also changes the operation mode to Sleep
   mode after VS supply recovery. The power-on reset level is active in all operation modes. See Figure 12.

4.9           TxD Time-out
The TxD time-out feature protects the LIN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the TxD
input is continuously “low”, caused by e.g. a malfunctioning microcontroller or a short circuit on the printed circuit
board. In Normal Operation mode, a logical “low” signal on the TxD input for the time tTxD disables the output stage
of the transmitter (see Figure 13). The receiver will remain active and the data on the bus are still monitored on
the RxD output.
The TLE7257 will release the output stage after a TxD time-out event first when detecting a logical “high” signal
on the TxD input for the time tto,rec.

Figure 13     TxD time-out
4.10          3.3 V and 5 V Logic Capability
The TLE7257 can be used for 3.3 V and 5 V microcontrollers. The logic inputs and the outputs are capable to
operate with both voltage levels. The RxD output needs an external pull-up resistor to the microcontroller supply
to define the voltage level (see Chapter 7.6 “RxD Pull-up Resistor” on Page 26 and Figure 16).
4.11          Short Circuit
The BUS pin of TLE7257 can withstand short circuits to either GND or to the VS power supply. The integrated over-
temperature protection may disable the transmitter in case of a permanent short circuit on the bus pin is causing
the overheating.

7.4            LIN Physical Layer Compatibility
The TLE7257 fulfills the Physical Layer Specification of LIN 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.2A.
The differences between LIN specification 1.2 and 1.3 is mainly the physical layer specification. The reason was
to improve the compatibility between the nodes.
The LIN specification 2.0 is a super set of the 1.3 version. The 2.0 version offers new features. However, it is
possible to use the LIN 1.3 slave node in a 2.0 node cluster, as long as the new features are not used. Vice versa
it is possible to use a LIN 2.0 node in the 1.3 cluster without using the new features.
In terms of the physical layer the LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 and LIN 2.2A Specification does not include any changes and
is fully compliant to the LIN Specification 2.0.
LIN 2.2A is the latest version of the LIN specification, released in December 2010. The physical layer specification
of LIN 2.2A will be included in the ISO 17987-4 without modifications.
Additionally, the TLE7257 is compliant to the SAE J2602-2 standard for usage in the US automotive market.
7.5            TxD Fail-Safe Input
The TxD input has an internal pull-up structure to avoid any bus disturbance in case the TxD input is open and
floating. In case of an not connected TxD input, the pin is pulled to an internal voltage supply (see Figure 1) and
the output to the LIN bus on the BUS pin is always “recessive”. Therefore the TLE7257 can not disturb the
communication on the LIN bus.
In order to optimize the quiescent current of the TLE7257 in Sleep mode, the pull-up structure inside the TxD input
is disabled in Sleep mode. The logic inside the TxD input is not reacting at any signal change provide to the TxD
input pin and the transmitter is turned off. In Sleep mode the TLE7257 can not disturb or block the LIN bus in any
case.

Normal Operation mode                           The internal pull-up structure is active, in case the TxD input is open the
                                                TxD input signal is “high” and the output on the BUS pin is “recessive”
Standby mode                                    The internal pull-up structure is active, in case the TxD input is open the
                                                TxD input signal is “high”. In Standby mode the transmitter is turned off
                                                and therefore the output on the BUS pin always is “recessive”
Sleep mode                                      The internal pull-up structure is inactive, in case the TxD input is open the
                                                TxD input signal is “floating”. In Sleep mode the transmitter is turned off
                                                and therefore the output on the BUS pin always is “recessive”
7.6                  RxD Pull-up Resistor
The receive data output (RxD) provides an open drain behavior for allowing the output level to be adapted to the
microcontroller supply voltage. Thus 3.3 V microcontroller derivatives without 5 V tolerant ports can be used. In
case the microcontroller port pin does not provide an integrated pull-up, an external pull-up resistor connected to
the microcontroller’s VCC supply voltage is required.
The typical RxD pin current / voltage characteristic over temperature is given in Figure 17. With the applications
microcontroller port pins’ (Rx) minimum “high”-level and maximum “low”-level input voltage the pull-up resistor can
be dimensioned. For most applications a pull-up resistor RRx of 2.4 kΩ is recommended.

7.7           Compatibility with other Infineon LIN Transceivers
Infineon offers a complete LIN transceiver family consisting of devices in PG-DSO-8 package (TLE7257SJ,
TLE7258SJ and TLE7259-3GE) and PG-TSON-8 package (TLE7257LE, TLE7258D, TLE7258LE and TLE7259-
3LE). All these devices are pin-to-pin compatible, with the only differences at the pins named N.C. ( = Not
Connected). The N.C. pins can be left open on the PCB in applications where these functionalities are not needed.
The N.C. pins are internally not bonded, so the devices will not be affected if these pins are connected to signals
on the application PCB.
