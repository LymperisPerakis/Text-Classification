                  Dual LIN 2.2A/SAE J2602 transceiver
                  Rev. 3 ‚Äî 24 May 2018                                             Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1022 is a dual LIN transceiver that provides the interface between a Local
              Interconnect Network (LIN) master/slave protocol controller and the physical bus in a LIN
              network. It is primarily intended for in-vehicle subnetworks using baud rates up to 20 kBd
              and is compliant with LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V LIN)
              and SAE J2602. The TJA1022T and TJA1022TK (SO14/HVSON14 packages) are pin
              compatible with the TJA1020, TJA1021, TJA1027 and TJA1029; the TJA1022HG
              (DHVQFN24 package) is pin compatible with the TJA1024 (see Section 18). The
              TJA1022, TJA1024, TJA1027 and TJA1029 are software compatible.
              The transmit data streams generated by the protocol controller are converted by the
              TJA1022 into optimized bus signals shaped to minimize ElectroMagnetic Emissions
              (EME). The LIN bus output pins are pulled HIGH via internal termination resistors. For a
              master application, an external resistor in series with a diode should be connected
              between pin VBAT and each of the LIN pins. The receivers detect receive data streams on
              the LIN bus input pins and transfer them via pins RXD1 and RXD2 to the microcontroller.
              Power consumption is very low when both transceivers are in Sleep mode. However, the
              TJA1022 can still be woken up via pins LIN1/LIN2 and SLP1_N/SLP2_N.

7. Functional description
                       The TJA1022 is the interface between the LIN master/slave protocol controller and the
                       physical bus in a LIN network. According to the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model,
                       this is the LIN physical layer.
                       The LIN transceivers are optimized for, but not limited to, automotive applications with
                       excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance.
                   7.1 LIN 2.x/ISO 17987/SAE J2602 compliant
                       The TJA1022 is fully LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V LIN)
                       and SAE J2602 compliant. The LIN physical layer is independent of higher OSI model
                       layers (e.g. the LIN protocol). Consequently, nodes containing a LIN 2.2A-compliant
                       physical layer can be combined, without restriction, with LIN physical layer nodes that
                       comply with earlier revisions (LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3, LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1 and LIN
                       2.2).
                   7.2 Operating modes
                       The transceivers are fully operational in Normal mode. A low-power Sleep mode is also
                       supported, as well as a Reset mode. Standby mode facilitates the transition between
                       Sleep and Normal modes.
                       The transceivers operate independently (except in Reset mode), so one transceiver can
                       be in Normal mode while the other is Sleep or Standby etc. Power consumption is at a
                       minimum when both transceivers are in Sleep mode.
                7.2.1 Normal mode
                       In Normal mode, the TJA1022 can transmit and receive data via the LIN bus lines. The
                       transceivers operate independently, so one can be active while the other is off.
                       A transceiver will switch from Sleep or Standby mode to Normal mode if SLPx_N is held
                       HIGH for tgotonorm. If SLPx_N is held LOW for tgotosleep, the transceiver will switch from
                       Normal to Sleep mode.
                       The receivers detect data streams on the LIN bus lines (via pins LIN1 and LIN2) and
                       transfer the input via pins RXD1 and RXD2 to the microcontroller (see Figure 7): HIGH for
                       a recessive level and LOW for a dominant level on the bus. The receivers have
                       supply-voltage related thresholds with hysteresis and integrated filters to suppress bus
                       line noise.
                       Transmit data streams from the protocol controller are detected on the TXDx pins and are
                       converted by the transmitters into optimized bus signals shaped to minimize EME. The
                       LIN bus output pins are pulled HIGH via internal slave termination resistors. For a master

        (1) A positive edge on SLPx_N triggers a transition to Normal mode in the corresponding LIN transceiver; the LIN transmitter is
            enabled once TXDx goes HIGH; in the event of thermal shutdown, both LIN transceivers are disabled.
        (2) Power dissipation is at a minimum when both transceivers are in Sleep mode.
        (3) When a transceiver switches to Standby mode in response to a LIN bus wake-up event, the associated RXDx pin (RXD1 or
            RXD2) will be LOW to indicate which LIN channel was the source of the wake-up request.
  Fig 4.    State diagram
                   7.2.2 Sleep mode
                             A transceiver will switch to Sleep mode from Normal mode if SLPx_N is held LOW for
                             tgotosleep. The relevant LIN transmit path is disabled as soon as SLPx_N goes LOW.
                             Power consumption is very low when both transceivers are in Sleep mode.
                             The voltage levels on LINx and TXDx have no effect on a transition to Sleep mode. So the
                             transceiver will still switch to Sleep mode even if TXDx is held LOW or there is a
                             continuous dominant level on LINx (e.g. due to a short circuit to ground).
                             Although current consumption is extremely low when both transceivers are in Sleep
                             mode, the TJA1022 can still be woken up remotely via the LIN bus pins or by the
                             microcontroller via pins SLPx_N. Filters on the receiver inputs (LIN1 and LIN 2) and on
                             pins SLPx_N prevent unwanted wake-up events occurring due to automotive transients or
                             radio frequency interference. To be valid, all wake-up events must be maintained for a
                             specific length of time (twake(dom)LIN for a remote wake-up and tgotonorm for a wake-up via
                             SLPx_N). Pin RXDx is floating when a transceiver is in Sleep mode.

                      If a remote wake-up event (see Figure 5) is detected on either of the LIN bus lines, the
                      associated transceiver will switch to Standby mode. A wake-up initiated by the
                      microcontroller (SLPx_N HIGH for tgotonorm) will cause the relevant transceiver to switch to
                      Normal mode while the other transceiver remains in its current state.
                7.2.3 Standby mode
                      Standby mode is an intermediate mode between Sleep and Normal modes. A transceiver
                      will switch from Sleep mode to Standby mode in response to a LIN bus wake-up event.
                      Pin RXDx will go low to indicate to the microcontroller the source of the remote wake-up
                      (LIN1 or LIN2). A transceiver will switch from Standby to Normal mode if the
                      microcontroller holds SLPx_N HIGH for tgotonorm.
                7.2.4 Reset mode
                      When the TJA1022 is in Reset mode, all input signals are ignored and all output drivers
                      are off. The TJA1022 switches to Reset mode when the voltage on VBAT drops below the
                      LOW-level power-on reset threshold, Vth(POR)L. When the voltage on VBAT rises above the
                      HIGH-level power-on reset threshold, Vth(POR)H, the transceivers switch to Sleep mode.

                7.3.1 Remote wake-up via the LIN bus
                       A falling edge on pin LINx followed by a LOW level maintained for twake(dom)LIN followed by
                       a rising edge on pin LINx triggers a remote wake-up (see Figure 5). It should be noted that
                       the time period twake(dom)LIN is measured either in Normal mode while TXDx is HIGH, or in

                7.3.2 Wake-up via SLPx_N
                       If SLPx_N is held HIGH for tgotonorm, the transceiver will switch from Sleep mode to
                       Normal mode.
                   7.4 Operation during automotive cranking pulses
                       TJA1022 remains fully operational during automotive cranking pulses because the LIN
                       transceivers are fully specified down to VBAT = 5 V.
                   7.5 Operation when supply voltage is outside specified operating range
                       If VBAT > 18 V or VBAT < 5 V, the TJA1022 may remain operational, but parameter values
                       cannot be guaranteed to remain within the operating ranges specified in Table 8 and
                       Table 9.
                       In Normal mode:
                         ‚Ä¢ If the input level on pin TXDx is HIGH, the LIN transmitter output on pin LINx will be
                            recessive.
                         ‚Ä¢ If the input level on pin LINx is recessive, the receiver output on pin RXDx will be
                            HIGH.
                         ‚Ä¢ If the voltage on pin VBAT rises to 27 V (e.g. during an automotive jump-start), the total
                            LIN network pull-up resistance should be greater than 680 ÔÅó and the total LIN network
                            capacitance should be less than 6.8 nF to ensure reliable LIN data transfer.
                         ‚Ä¢ If the voltage on pin VBAT drops below the LOW-level VBAT LOW threshold, Vth(VBATL)L,
                            the active LIN transmit path(s) is interrupted and both LIN outputs will be recessive.
                            The previously active LIN transmit path(s) is switched on again when VBAT rises

                                                                                                                Dual LIN 2.2A/SAE J2602 transceiver
                       If the voltage on pin VBAT drops below the LOW-level power-on reset threshold, Vth(POR)L,
                       the TJA1022 switches to Reset mode (i.e. all output drivers are disabled and all inputs are
                       ignored). The TJA1022 switches to Sleep mode if VBAT > Vth(POR)H.
                   7.6 Fail-safe features
                       Pin TXDx is pulled down to ground in order to force a predefined level on the transmit data
                       input if the pin is disconnected.
                       Pin SLPx_N is pulled down to ground to ensure the transceiver is forced to Sleep x mode
                       if SLPx_N is disconnected.
                       Pins RXD1 and RXD2 are set floating if VBAT is disconnected.
                       The current in the transmitter output stage is limited in order to protect the transmitter
                       against short circuits to pins VBAT or GND.
                       A loss of power (pins VBAT and GND) has no impact on the bus lines or on the
                       microcontroller. No reverse current will flow from the bus lines into the LINx pins. The
                       current path from VBAT to LINx via the integrated LIN slave termination resistors remains.
                       The TJA1022 can be disconnected from the power supply without influencing the LIN
                       busses.
                       The output drivers on pins LIN1 and LIN2 are protected against overtemperature
                       conditions. If the junction temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd),
                       the thermal protection circuit disables the output drivers. The drivers are enabled again
                       when the junction temperature falls below Tj(sd) and pin TXDx is HIGH.
                       The initial TXD dominant check prevents the bus being driven to a permanent dominant
                       state (blocking all network communications) if pin TXDx is forced permanently LOW by a
                       hardware and/or software application failure. The input level on TXDx is checked after a
                       transition to Normal mode. If TXDx is LOW, the transmit path will remain disabled and will
                       only be enabled when TXDx goes HIGH.
                       Once the transmitter has been enabled, a TXD dominant time-out timer is started every
                       time pin TXDx goes LOW. If the LOW state on pin TXDx persists for longer than the
                       TXD dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                       line to recessive state. The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXDx goes
                       HIGH.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 ‚ÄúSurface mount reflow
                     soldering description‚Äù.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       ‚Ä¢ Through-hole components
                       ‚Ä¢ Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       ‚Ä¢  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       ‚Ä¢  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       ‚Ä¢  Package placement
                       ‚Ä¢  Inspection and repair
                       ‚Ä¢  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                16.3 Wave soldering

                       ‚Ä¢ Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢ Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       ‚Ä¢ Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       ‚Ä¢ Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.

                     a single socket that can accommodate all five IC‚Äôs. The appropriate device would be
                     inserted into the socket, depending on the application, as illustrated in Figure 12. The
                     TJA1022HG pin layout is a compatible subset of the TJA1024HG.
