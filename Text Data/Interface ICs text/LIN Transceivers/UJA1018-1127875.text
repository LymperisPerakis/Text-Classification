                 Rev. 1 — 10 July 2012                                             Product data sheet
1. General description
              The UJA1018 is a LIN 2.0/2.1/2.2/SAE J2602 transceiver with an integrated low-drop
              voltage regulator. The voltage regulator can deliver up to 70 mA at 5.0 V. The UJA1018
              facilitates the development of compact nodes in LIN bus systems. In addition, the
              UJA1018 supports LIN node address assignment in daisy chain networks via a LIN bus
              switch. To support robust designs, the UJA1018 offers strong ElectroStatic Discharge
              (ESD) performance and can withstand high voltages on the LIN bus. In order to minimize
              current consumption, the UJA1018 supports a Sleep mode in which the LIN transceiver
              and the voltage regulator are powered down while still having wake-up capability via the
              LIN bus.
              Three high-side switches are integrated into the UJA1018. They are intended to support a
              variety of applications, including LED control for ambient lighting.
              The UJA1018 comes in a 3.5 mm  5.5 mm HVSON16 package to help minimize board
              size. The exposed center pad in the HVSON16 package provides enhanced thermal
              performance.

                                                                                                          LIN system basis chip with LED drivers
7. Functional description
                       The UJA1018 combines the functionality of a LIN transceiver and a voltage regulator in a
                       single chip and supports wake-up by bus activity. The voltage regulator is designed to
                       power the Electronic Control Unit's (ECU) microcontroller and its peripherals.
                       The LIN transceiver is the interface between the LIN master/slave protocol controller and
                       the physical bus in a LIN network. According to the Open System Interconnect (OSI)
                       model, these modules make up the LIN physical layer.
                       The LIN transceiver is optimized for, but not limited to, automotive applications with a
                       transmission speed of 20 kBd (the maximum specified in the LIN standard) and excellent
                       ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance.
                       The UJA1018 comes with three integrated high-side switches for use in applications such
                       as LED ambient lighting. The switches are designed to drive up to 30 mA.
                   7.1 Slave Node Position Detection (SNPD)
                       The UJA1018 supports Slave Node Position Detection (SNPD). The LIN switch method
                       (LSM) is used to detect the position of LSM slave nodes in a daisy chain LIN network.
                       Unique addresses are assigned to individual nodes at start-up based on their position on
                       the bus, allowing a number of functionally identical modules to be included in a network.
                       LSM slave nodes can be combined with standard nodes in any order.
                       In order to detect the position of an LSM slave node in a network, a switch is connected
                       between pins LIN and LINSW. When closed, this switch connects the LIN bus to the next
                       node in the daisy chain, allowing the master to address each node in turn.
                   7.2 LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 compliant
                       The UJA1018 is fully LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 and SAE J2602 compliant. Since the LIN
                       physical layer is independent of higher OSI model layers (e.g. the LIN protocol), nodes
                       containing a LIN 2.2-compliant physical layer can be combined, without restriction, with
                       LIN physical layer nodes that comply with earlier revisions (i.e. LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2,
                       LIN 1.3, LIN 2.0 and LIN 2.1).
                   7.3 Operating modes
                       The UJA1018 supports four operating modes: Normal, Standby, Sleep and Off. The
                       operating modes, and the transitions between modes, are illustrated in Figure 3.

                        Fig 3.    State diagram
                7.3.1 Off mode
                      The UJA1018 switches to Off mode from all other modes if the battery supply voltage
                      drops below the power-off detection threshold (Vth(det)poff) or the junction temperature
                      exceeds the overtemperature protection activation threshold (Tth(act)otp).
                      The voltage regulator and the LIN physical layer are disabled in Off mode, and pin RSTN
                      is forced LOW.
                7.3.2 Standby mode
                      Standby mode is a low-power mode that guarantees very low current consumption.
                      The UJA1018 switches from Off mode to Standby mode as soon as the battery supply
                      voltage rises above the power-on detection threshold (VBAT > Vth(det)pon), provided the
                      junction temperature is below the overtemperature protection release threshold
                      (Tvj < Tth(rel)otp).
                      The UJA1018 switches to Standby mode from Normal mode during the mode select
                      window if TXD is HIGH and EN is LOW (see Section 7.3.5), provided RSTN is HIGH.
                      A remote wake-up event triggers a transition to Standby mode from Sleep mode. A remote
                      wake-up event is signalled by a continuous LOW level on pin RXD.

                       In Standby mode, the voltage regulator is on, the LIN physical layer is disabled and
                       remote wake-up detection is active. The wake-up source is indicated by the level on RXD
                       (LOW indicates a remote wake-up).
                7.3.3 Normal mode
                       If the EN pin is pulled HIGH while the UJA1018 is in Standby mode (with RSTN = 1) or
                       Sleep mode, the device enters Normal mode. The LIN physical layer and the voltage
                       regulator are enabled in Normal mode.
               7.3.3.1 The LIN transceiver in Normal mode
                       The LIN transceiver is activated when the UJA1018 enters Normal mode.
                       In Normal mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via the LIN bus. The
                       receiver detects data streams on the LIN pin and transfers them to the microcontroller via
                       pin RXD. LIN recessive is represented by a HIGH level on RXD, LIN dominant by a LOW
                       level.
                       The transmitter converts data streams received from the protocol controller into bus
                       signals with optimized slew rate and wave shaping to minimize EME. A LOW level on the
                       TXD input is converted to a LIN dominant level while a HIGH level is converted to a LIN
                       recessive level.
                7.3.4 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode features extremely low power consumption.
                       The UJA1018 switches to Sleep mode from Normal mode during the mode select window
                       if TXD and EN are both LOW (see Section 7.3.5), provided RSTN is HIGH.
                       The voltage regulator and the LIN physical layer are disabled in Sleep mode. Pin RSTN is
                       forced LOW. Remote wake-up detection is active.
                7.3.5 Transition from Normal to Sleep or Standby mode
                       When EN is driven LOW in Normal mode, the UJA1018 disables the transmit path. The
                       mode select window opens tmsel(min) after EN goes LOW. It closes tmsel(max) after EN goes
                       LOW (see Figure 4).
                       The TXD pin is sampled in the mode select window. A transition to Standby mode is
                       triggered if TXD is HIGH, or to Sleep mode if TXD is LOW. TXD must remain HIGH or
                       LOW, as appropriate, while the mode select window is open.
                       To avoid complicated timing in the application, EN and TXD can be pulled LOW at the
                       same time without affecting the LIN bus. To ensure that the remote wake-up time
                       (twake(dom)LIN) is not reset on a transition to Sleep mode, TXD should be pulled LOW at
                       least td(EN-TXD) after EN goes LOW. This functionality is guaranteed by design.

                                                                                           tmsel(max)                                                     015aaa087
                                    TXD is sampled during the mode select window. The UJA1018 switches to Standby (TXD HIGH) or
                                    Sleep (TXD LOW) mode after sampling.

                   7.4 Power supplies
                7.4.1 Battery (pin BAT)
                       The UJA1018 contains a single supply pin, BAT. An external diode is needed in series to
                       protect the device against negative voltages. The operating range is from 5.5 V to 18 V.
                       The UJA1018 can handle voltages up to 40 V (max). If the voltage on pin BAT falls below
                       Vth(det)poff, the UJA1018 switches to Off mode, shutting down the internal logic and the
                       voltage regulator and disabling the LIN transmitter. The UJA1018 exits Off mode as soon
                       as the voltage rises above Vth(det)pon, provided the junction temperature is below Tth(rel)otp.
                7.4.2 Voltage regulator (pin VCC)
                       The UJA1018 contains a voltage regulator, supplied via pin BAT, that delivers up to
                       70 mA. It is designed to supply the microcontroller and its periphery via pin VCC.
                7.4.3 Reset (pin RSTN)
                       The output voltage on pin VCC is monitored continuously and a system reset signal is
                       generated (pin RSTN goes LOW) if an undervoltage event is detected (VCC < Vuvd for
                       tdet(uv)(VCC)). Pin RSTN will go HIGH again once the voltage on VCC exceeds the
                       undervoltage recovery threshold (Vuvr) for trst.
                   7.5 LIN transceiver
                       The transceiver is the interface between a LIN master/slave protocol controller and the
                       physical bus in a LIN network. It is primarily intended for in-vehicle subnetworks using
                       baud rates from 2.4 kBd up to 20 kBd and is LIN 2.0/LIN 2.1/LIN 2.2/SAE J2602
                       compliant.
                   7.6 Remote wake-up
                       A remote wake-up is triggered by a falling edge on pin LIN, followed by LIN remaining
                       LOW for at least twake(dom)LIN, followed by a rising edge on pin LIN (see Figure 5).

                         Fig 5.    Remote wake-up behavior
                       The remote wake-up request is communicated to the microcontroller in Standby mode by
                       a continuous LOW level on pin RXD.
                       Note that twake(dom)LIN is measured in Sleep and Standby modes, and in Normal mode if
                       TXD is HIGH.
                   7.7 LIN switch
                       The LIN switch is controlled via input pin LINOFF. When LINOFF is LOW, the switch is
                       closed and the LIN bus is connected to the output pin LINSW. If pin LINOFF is HIGH, the
                       LIN bus transmission from LIN to LINSW is interrupted.
                       An internal pull-down resistor ensures that a defined signal level is always present on pin
                       LINOFF.
                       The input level on pin LINOFF is ignored when pin RSTN is LOW or overtemperature
                       protection has been activated. The internal default input state is LOW (transmission
                       activated).
                   7.8 High-side switches
                       The high-side switches on pins HS0, HS1 and HS2 are controlled via input pins HSON0,
                       HSON1 and HSON2, respectively. A high-side switch is ON when the corresponding
                       control input pin is HIGH.
                       Internal pull-down resistors on HSON0, HSON1 and HSON2 ensure that a defined level is
                       always present on these pins when the switch is off.
                       The input levels on pins HSON0, HSON1 and HSON2 are ignored when RSTN is LOW.
                       The internal default input state is LOW.
                   7.9 Fail-safe features
                7.9.1 General fail-safe features
                       The following general fail-safe features have been implemented:
                         • An internal pull-up towards VCC on pin TXD guarantees a recessive bus level if the pin
                            is left floating by a bad solder joint or a floating microcontroller port pin.

                                                                                                            LIN system basis chip with LED drivers
                        • The current in the transmitter output stage is limited to protect the transmitter against
                           short circuits to pin BAT.
                        • A loss of power (pins BAT and GND) has no impact on the microcontroller; no reverse
                           currents flow from the bus.
                        • The LIN transmitter is automatically disabled when either EN or RSTN is LOW.
                        • After a transition to Normal mode, the LIN transmitter will only be activated when pin
                           TXD is HIGH (LIN recessive).
                7.9.2 TXD dominant time-out function
                      If a hardware or software application failure causes TXD to be held permanently LOW, a
                      TXD dominant time-out timer circuit is activated. This function prevents the bus line being
                      driven to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network communications).
                      The timer is triggered by a negative edge on the TXD pin. If TXD remains LOW for longer
                      than the TXD dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, driving the
                      bus line to a recessive state. The timer is reset by a positive edge on TXD.
                7.9.3 Temperature protection
                      The temperature of the IC is monitored in Normal, Standby and Off modes. If the
                      temperature is too high (Tvj > Tth(act)otp), the UJA1018 switches to Off mode (if in Standby
                      or Normal modes). The voltage regulator and the LIN transmitter are switched off and the
                      RSTN pin is driven LOW.
                      When the temperature falls below the overtemperature protection release threshold
                      (Tvj < Tth(rel)otp), the UJA1018 switches to Standby mode.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 10) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 10.
