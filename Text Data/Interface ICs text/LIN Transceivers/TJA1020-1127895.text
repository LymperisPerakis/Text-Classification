FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
The TJA1020 is the interface between the LIN master/slave protocol controller and the physical bus in a Local
Interconnect Network (LIN). The LIN transceiver is optimized for the maximum specified LIN transmission speed of
20 Kbaud providing optimum EMC performance due to wave shaping of the LIN output.
Operating modes
The TJA1020 provides two modes of normal operation, one intermediate mode and one very low power mode. Figure 3
shows the state diagram.

Notes
1. The standby mode is entered automatically upon any local or remote wake-up event during sleep mode. Pin INH and
     the 30 kΩ termination resistor at pin LIN are switched on.
2. The internal wake-up source flag (set if a local wake-up did occur and fed to pin TXD) will be reset when entering
     normal slope or low slope mode (NSLP goes HIGH).
3. The wake-up interrupt (on pin RXD) is released when entering normal slope or low slope mode (NSLP goes HIGH).
4. The normal slope mode is entered during a positive edge on NSLP while pin TXD is already set HIGH. In the event
     of a short-circuit to ground on pin TXD, the transmitter will be disabled.
5. The low slope mode is entered during the positive edge on NSLP while pin TXD is already pulled LOW.

Notes
1. All parameters are guaranteed over the virtual junction temperature by design, but only 100% tested at 125 °C
     ambient temperature for dies on wafer level and, in addition to this, 100% tested at 25 °C ambient temperature for
     cased products, unless otherwise specified.
2. For bare die, all parameters are only guaranteed if the backside of the bare die is connected to ground.
3. If VBAT is higher than 12 V, the battery current increases due to the internal LIN termination resistor. The minimum
                                                                                                                                             V BAT – 12 V
     value of this resistor is 20 kΩ. The maximum current increase is therefore: I BAT ( increase ) = -------------------------------                    -

Wave soldering
Conventional single wave soldering is not recommended
for surface mount devices (SMDs) or printed-circuit boards
with a high component density, as solder bridging and
non-wetting can present major problems.

Notes
1. For more detailed information on the BGA packages refer to the “(LF)BGA Application Note” (AN01026); order a copy
    from your Philips Semiconductors sales office.
2. All surface mount (SMD) packages are moisture sensitive. Depending upon the moisture content, the maximum
    temperature (with respect to time) and body size of the package, there is a risk that internal or external package
    cracks may occur due to vaporization of the moisture in them (the so called popcorn effect). For details, refer to the
    Drypack information in the “Data Handbook IC26; Integrated Circuit Packages; Section: Packing Methods”.
3. These transparent plastic packages are extremely sensitive to reflow soldering conditions and must on no account
    be processed through more than one soldering cycle or subjected to infrared reflow soldering with peak temperature
    exceeding 217 °C ± 10 °C measured in the atmosphere of the reflow oven. The package body peak temperature
    must be kept as low as possible.
4. These packages are not suitable for wave soldering. On versions with the heatsink on the bottom side, the solder
    cannot penetrate between the printed-circuit board and the heatsink. On versions with the heatsink on the top side,
    the solder might be deposited on the heatsink surface.
5. If wave soldering is considered, then the package must be placed at a 45° angle to the solder wave direction.
    The package footprint must incorporate solder thieves downstream and at the side corners.
6. Wave soldering is suitable for LQFP, TQFP and QFP packages with a pitch (e) larger than 0.8 mm; it is definitely not
    suitable for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.65 mm.
7. Wave soldering is suitable for SSOP, TSSOP, VSO and VSSOP packages with a pitch (e) equal to or larger than
    0.65 mm; it is definitely not suitable for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.5 mm.
8. Image sensor packages in principle should not be soldered. They are mounted in sockets or delivered pre-mounted
    on flex foil. However, the image sensor package can be mounted by the client on a flex foil by using a hot bar
    soldering process. The appropriate soldering profile can be provided on request.
9. Hot bar or manual soldering is suitable for PMFP packages.
