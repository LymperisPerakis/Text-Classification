Short Description
The MLX8005x/3x consist of a low-drop voltage regulator 5V/3.3V/70mA combined with a Reset/Watchdog unit and a LIN bus trans-
ceiver. The LIN transceiver is suitable for LIN bus systems conform to LIN specification revision 2.x and SAE J2602. The watchdog
times of the integrated window watchdog can be adapted on application needs via external resistors. With the help of an external
bipolar transistor it is possible to extend the output current of the integrated voltage regulator. The combination of voltage regulator
and bus transceiver as well as watchdog unit makes it possible to develop simple, but powerful and cheap slave nodes in LIN Bus
systems.

MLX80050/51/30/31
LIN System Basis ICs
Datasheet
3.1. Supply Pin VS
VS is the operational voltage pin of MLX8005x/3x. The voltage range is VS = 6 to 18V. After switching on VS, the
MLX8003x/5x starts at Standby Mode and the VCC voltage regulator ramps up. An undervoltage detection unit prevent
an undefined operation for Vs < 4V.
VS- Power-ON
If VS is switched on, the MLX8003x/5x starts in Standby Mode. A combination of dynamic POR and under voltage reset
circuitry generates a POR signal, which switches the MLX8003x/5x on. This power on behaviour is independent from the
status of the EN-pin.
Power-on reset and under-voltage reset operate independent from each other, which secures the independence from
the rise time of VS.
3.2. EN input pin
The ENable input is the mode control pin of MLX8003x/5x in combination with the TxD input.
The MLX8003x/5x is switched into the Sleep Mode with a falling edge and into normal mode with a rising edge at the
EN pin. The state machine goes to Normal Mode after t Res (see also Table 4: AC Characteristics). The Normal Mode will
be kept as long as EN remains high.
The Normal Mode can be entered from Standby Mode, when the pin EN is driven HIGH. To prevent unwanted mode
transitions, the EN input contains a debounce filter as specified (t EN_deb).
The pin EN contains a weak pull down resistor. The input thresholds are compatible to 3.3V and 5V supply systems.
MLX80031/51:
Additionally the positive edge on pin EN results in an immediate reset of the active low interrupt on pin RxD as well as
the wake-up source recognition flag on pin TxD.
3.3. Ground pin GND
This is the reference pin of the IC. The absence of GND connection will not influence or disturb the communication be-
tween other LIN bus nodes.
3.4. LIN
This bidirectional pin consists of a low side driver in the output path and a high-voltage comparator in the input path.
Furthermore is integrated a LIN pull-up resistor between LIN and VS pin. Low side driver consist a current limitation.
3.5. Receiver Output RxD
The pin RxD is a buffered open drain output. Output signals can be shifted by the external pull up resistor to 3.3V and
5V supply systems.
3.6. Transmit Input TxD
The transmit data stream of the LIN protocol controller applied to the pin TxD is converted into the LIN bus signal with
slew rate control in order to minimize electromagnetic emissions.
The pin TxD contains a weak pull up resistor. The input thresholds are compatible to 3.3V and 5V supply systems. To
enable the transmit path, the TxD pin has to be driven recessive (HIGH) after or during the normal mode has been en-
tered.
3.6.1. TxD dominant time-out feature
With the first dominant level on pin TxD after the transmit path has been enabled, the dominant time-out counter is
started. In case of a faulty blocked permanent dominant level on pin TxD the transmit path will be disabled after the
specified time tTxD_to. The time-out counter is reset by the first negative edge on pin TxD.

3.7. Output NRES
The NRES pin outputs the reset state as well as the watchdog condition in MLX80031 and MLX80051.
3.8. Voltage regulator pins VCC and RTG
The MLX80030/50 has an integrated low drop linear regulator with a p-channel-MOSFET as driving transistor. This regu-
lator outputs a voltage of 5V ±2% (MLX80050/51) or 3.3V ±2% (MLX80030/31) with a load current of max. 70mA. The
current limitation unit limits the output current for short circuits or overload to 130mA by decreasing the VCC voltage.
This way the power dissipation is held constant at a maximum value.
The voltage regulator has two pins, output pin RTG and sense input pin VCC. For MLX80030/50 both, RTG and VCC, are
commonly bonded to pin VCC on the package.
Devices MLX80031/51 has both pins bonded and provides the possibility to use an external npn transistor to boost the
maximum load current. In this case the basis of the npn transistor has to be connected to the RTG pin and the emitter
to the VCC pin. In case of using the internal voltage regulator, both pins have to be connected to each other.
3.9. INH Output (only MLX80031/51)
INH switches to high (VS connected to INH) in case of Standby or Normal Mode. INH is switched off at Silent and Sleep
Mode. The pin will be used for switch on an external power supply or for switch off the external 1k master resistor in
master node applications.
3.10. WAKE Input (only MLX80031/51)
High voltage input pin for local wake-up functionality. With a falling edge on WAKE the IC wakes-up from Silent Mode
or Sleep Mode to Standby Mode.
The pin WAKE provides a weak pull up current source towards Vs which provides a HIGH level on the pin in case of open
circuit failures or if no local wake-up feature is required. In such applications it is recommended to connect the pin
WAKE directly to pin Vs in order to prevent influences due to EMI.
3.11. KL15 Input (only MLX80031/51)
High voltage input pin for local wake-up functionality. With a rising edge on KL15 the IC wakes-up from Silent Mode or
Sleep Mode to Standby Mode.
The pin KL15 provides a weak current sink towards GND which provides a LOW level on the pin in case of open circuit
failures or if no local wake-up feature is required. In such applications it is recommended to connect the pin KL15 di-
rectly to GND in order to prevent influences due to EMI. KL15 is typically connected to the ignition terminal and gener-
ates a local wake-up at start of ignition.
3.12. Watchdog Trigger Input NWDI (only MLX80031/51)
This input is used to trigger the integrated window watchdog in MLX80031/51. Every falling edge on NWDI in watchdog
open window is used to reset the watchdog timer. An internal pull up resistor of 250k secures a stable high condition if
this pin is open. The NWDI input is a low voltage CMOS input. The minimum low time of NWDI is one WD_OSC clock
period to allow falling edge detection.
3.13. Watchdog Oscillator Resistor RBWD (only MLX80031/51)
A resistor between RBWD and GND defines the window watchdog times as trigger time.
3.14. Mode Input MODE (only MLX80031/51)
Special pin for to disable the window watchdog function. For normal watchdog operation connect the MODE pin to
GND directly or via external resistor. With MODE pin on 3.3V/5V the window watchdog is switched off.

4. Operational Modes
The MLX8003x/5x provides four main operating modes “Standby”, “Normal”, “Silent” and “Sleep”. The main modes are
fixed states defined by basic actions (VS start, EN or wake-up).

4.2. Initialisation and Standby mode
When the battery supply voltage VS exceeds the specified threshold V SUVR_OFF, the MLX8003x/5x automatically enters
the Standby Mode. Following internal procedure is running:
    First:
      Start of internal supply Vaux and POR of Vaux
      Start of internal RC oscillator
    Second and parallel after POR:
      Start of voltage regulator
The output voltage VCC ramps up to nominal value. The pin RxD is floating and the integrated slave pull up resistor with
decoupling diode pulls the pin LIN. The transmitter as well as the receiver is disabled.
If there occurs no mode change to Normal Mode via an EN LOW to HIGH transition within the time stated (typically
350ms), the IC enters the most power saving Sleep Mode.
Furthermore the standby mode will be entered after a valid local or remote wake up event, when the MLX8003x/5x is
in Sleep or Silent mode. The entering of the standby mode after wake up will be indicated by an active LOW interrupt
on pin RxD.
4.3. Normal Mode
This mode is the base mode. The bus transceiver is able to send with a max baud rate of 20kbit/s.
The whole MLX8003x/5x is active. The incoming bus traffic is detected by the receiver and transferred via the RxD out-
put pin to the microcontroller.
Exit the Normal Mode with one of the following conditions:
        1. High-to-low edge on EN pin with TxD = H -> switch to Silent Mode
        2. High-to-low edge on EN pin with TxD = L -> switch to Sleep Mode
        3. Undervoltage monitor on VCC detects a low voltage reset condition (VCC < V RES) -> switch back to stand-by
            mode.
Low Slew Mode
The first rising edge on EN after power-on defines the slew rate of the device. With TxD = High at this point works the
MLX8003x/5x with normal slew rate (default state). TxD = Low activates the Low Slew Mode, as long as VS > VSUVR_OFF.
In this mode the slew rate is switched from the normal value of typ. 1.6V/µs to a low value of typ. 0.8V/µs. This mode is
optimized to send with a maximum baud rate of 10.4kbit/s (acc. to SAE J2602). Because of this reduction of the slew
rate the EME behaviour is improved especially in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10MHz.

4.4. Silent Mode
The Silent Mode is a special mode for application with active Sleep Mode on LIN, but the connected MCU still needs to
be supplied with VCC.
With a falling edge on EN input in combination with TxD=high switches the MLX8003x/5x from Normal Mode to the
Silent Mode with reduced internal current consumption.
In Silent Mode the voltage regulator is on with a 2% tolerance. The transmitter is disabled and the pin RxD is discon-
nected from the receive path and is floating. The slave termination resistor (LIN pull up resistor with decoupling diode
between pins LIN and VS) is disconnected; only a weak current source is applied to the LIN bus. Value is typical -75uA,
limits -20…-100uA.
Exit the silent mode with one of the following conditions:
        1. Low-to-high edge on the EN pin -> switch back to normal mode
        2. Remote wake up (all versions) or local wake up request (MLX80031/51 only) -> switch to standby mode
        3. Undervoltage monitor on VCC detects a low voltage reset condition (VCC < V RES) -> switch back to stand-by
            mode.

4.5. Sleep Mode
The most power saving mode of the MLX8003x/5x is the Sleep Mode. The MLX8003x/5x offers two procedures to enter
the sleep mode:
      The mode is selected from normal mode with a falling edge on EN in combination with
          TxD = L.
      If the MLX8003x/5x is in Standby Mode after power-on or wake-up, a sleep counter is started and switches the
          transceiver into Sleep Mode after the specified time (typ. 350ms) even when the microcontroller of the ECU
          will not confirm the normal operation by setting the EN pin to logic HIGH. This new feature allows faulty
          blocked LIN nodes to reach always the most power saving mode.
Being in Sleep Mode the voltage regulator switched off in order to minimize the current consumption of the complete
LIN node. The transmitter is disabled and the pin RxD is disconnected from the receive path and is low (follows VCC).
The slave termination resistor (LIN pull up resistor with decoupling diode between pins LIN and VS) is disconnected,
only a weak current source is applied to the LIN bus (see chapter 8 fail-safe features)
Exit the Sleep Mode with the following condition:
     1. Remote (all versions) or local wake up request (MLX80031/51 only) -> Switch to Standby Mode
     2. EN = L/H -> Switch to Standby Mode

This is an intermediate state, which will pass through after switch on of VS or after undervoltage detection VS with VS <
VSUVR_ON. The internal supply voltage Vaux ramp up and the initial readout procedure of zenerzap storage are started. At
the end of this phase the VCC voltage definition and the definition of MLX8003x5x version is established. This Init-State
changes to Standby Mode with the start of VCC regulator.

5. Wake Up Procedures
The MLX80030/50 versions offer only remote wake-up:
After a falling edge on the LIN bus followed by a dominant voltage level for longer than the specified value (t wu_remote)
and a rising edge on pin LIN will cause a remote wake up. The device switches to Standby Mode and the wake-up re-
quest is indicated by an active LOW on pin RxD.
The MLX80031/51 versions offer three wake-up procedures:
         In applications with continuously powered ECU a wake up via mode transition to normal mode is possible (see
          chapter 4.3 Normal Mode).
         Remote wake-up via LIN bus traffic
          After a falling edge on the LIN bus followed by a dominant voltage level for longer than the specified
          value(twu_remote) and a rising edge on pin LIN will cause a remote wake up.
         Local wake-up via a falling edge on pin WAKE
          A falling edge on the pin WAKE and a dominant voltage level for longer than the specified time (twu_WAKE) will
          cause a local wake-up. The current for an external switch has to be provided by an external pull up resistor
          RWK. For a reverse current limitation in case of a closed external switch and a negative ground shift or an ECU
          loss of ground a protection resistor RWK_prot between pin WAKE and the switch is recommended.
         Local wake-up via a rising edge on pin KL15
          A positive edge on the pin KL15 followed by a high voltage level for a time period t wu_KL15 > 250µs results in a
          local wake-up request. The MLX80031/51 switches to the Standby Mode. The long debouncing time on KL15
          suppresses unintentional transients. A high level on KL15 has no influence of switching between modes with
          EN input. Before a new local wake-up request via KL15 can be started, KL15 have to be switched to low level
          for a time > 250µs.
5.1. Wake Up Source Recognition in MLX80031/51
The device can distinguish between a local wake-up event (pin WAKE or pin KL15) and a remote wake-up event. The
wake-up source flag is set after a local wake-up event and is indicated by an active LOW on pin TxD.
The wake-up flag can be read if an external pull up resistor towards the microcontroller supply voltage has been added
and the MLX80031/51 is still in standby mode:
         LOW level indicates a local wake-up event
         HIGH level indicates a remote wake up event
The wake-up request is indicated by an active LOW on pin RxD and can be used for an interrupt.
When the microcontroller confirms a normal mode operation by setting the pin EN to HIGH, both the wake-up request
on pin RxD as well as the wake-up source flag on pin TxD are reset immediately.

6. Functionality
6.1. RESET behaviour of MLX8003x/5x
The MLX8003x/5x contains a reset unit which controls the initialization and generation of the reset signal. The NRES pin
flags the reset state of the MLX8003x/5x. The POR timer will be started if V S is switched on and VCC > VRES threshold.
After the time tRes the NRES output is switched from low to high.
The reset unit combines a VCC low voltage detection unit with fixed reset timer. This output is switched from low to
high if VS is switched on and after the time tRes is VCC > VRES.
A drop of the VCC voltage will be detected by the low voltage reset unit which generates a reset signal. The
MLX8003x/5x will be reinitialized if the VCC voltage rises above the low voltage limit.
If the voltage VCC drops below VRES then the NRES output is switched from high to low after the time trr. This filters short breaks
of the VCC voltage and avoids uncontrolled reset generation.

The MLX80031/51 version combines the reset behaviour described above with a window-watchdog unit.
The NRES pin outputs the reset state as well as the watchdog condition. The POR timer will be started if VSUP is switched
on and VCC > POR threshold. After the time tRes the RESET output is switched from low to high. The watchdog is disabled
during this POR procedure. After the POR delay, the NRES output is switched from low to high and the watchdog starts.
In normal mode the NRES pin flags the status of the window watchdog.
6.2. Thermal Shutdown
If the junction temperature TJ is higher than TJSHD, the MLX8003x/5x switches from any mode into Standby Mode. Dur-
ing TSD all functions are switched-off. The transceiver and the voltage regulator are completely disabled; no wake-up
functionality is available.
If TJ falls below the thermal recovery temperature TJREC, MLX8003x/5x resumes operation starting from Standby Mode.
If EN=H at recovery, chip switches to NORMAL after VCC>VRES and tres. SBY-timeout timer is disabled during TSD.
6.3. VS under voltage reset
The under voltage detection unit prevents an undefined behaviour of the MLX8003x/5x under low voltage condition (VS
< VSUVR_ON). If VS drops below VSUVR_ON, the under voltage detection becomes active and the IC will be switched from
every state to Init-State followed by Standby Mode with the same behaviour like after VS power-on. With the following
increase of VS above VSUVR_OFF the MLX8003x5x remains in Standby Mode and the voltage regulator starts with the ini-
tialization sequence (Vcc available). If EN=H at power-up, the chip switches to NORMAL after VCC>VRES and tres.

Remark: In case Vs drops below 5V but still remains above V SUVR_ON , Vcc follows Vs. Vcc is switched off during Vs Un-
dervoltage reset.
6.4. LIN-Transceiver
The MLX8003x/5x has an integrated bi-directional bus interface device for data transfer between LIN bus and the LIN
protocol controller.
The transceiver consists of a driver with slew rate control, wave shaping and current limitation and a receiver with high
voltage comparator followed by a debouncing unit.
Transmit Mode
During transmission the data at the pin TxD will be transferred to the LIN driver to generate a bus signal. To minimize
the electromagnetic emission of the bus line, the LIN driver has an integrated slew rate control and wave shaping unit.
Transmitting will be interrupted in the following cases:
     - Sleep Mode
     - Silent Mode
     - Thermal Shutdown active
     - Power on Reset
The recessive LIN bus level is generated from the integrated 30k pull up resistor in serial with an active diode This diode
prevents the reverse current of VLIN during differential voltage between VS and LIN (VLIN>VS).
No additional termination resistor is necessary to use the MLX8003x/5x in LIN slave nodes. If this ICs are used for LIN
master nodes it is necessary that the LIN pin is terminated via an external 1k resistor in series with a diode to VBAT.
Receive Mode
The data signals from the LIN pin will be transferred continuously to the pin RxD. Short spikes on the bus signal are sup-
pressed by the implemented debouncing circuit.
Slew Modes and Data rates
The MLX8003x/5x consists a constant slew rate transceiver which means that the bus driver works with a mode de-
pended slew rate. In normal mode the slew rate is typical 1.6 V/µs (max. baud rate 20kbit/s) and in low slew mode typi-
cal 0.8 V/µs. The lower slew rate in low slew mode associated with a baud rate of 10.4kbit/s improves the EME behav-
iour.
The LIN transceiver of MLX8003x/5x is compatible to the physical layer specification according to LIN 2.x specification
for data rates up to 20kbit/s and the SAE specification J2602 for data rates up to 10.4kbit/s.
 The constant slew rate principle is very robust against voltage drops and can operate with RC- oscillator systems with a
clock tolerance up to ±2% between 2 nodes.
Low Slew Mode
In this mode the slew rate is switched from the normal value of typical 1.6V/µs to a low value of typical 0.8V/µs. This
mode is optimized to send with a maximum baud rate of 10.4kbit/s (acc. to SAE J2602). Because of this reduction of the
slew rate the EME behaviour is improved especially in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10MHz.
6.5. Voltage Regulator
The MLX8003x/5x has an integrated low drop linear regulator with a p-channel-MOSFET as driving transistor. This regu-
lator outputs a voltage of 3.3V/5V ±2% and a current of 70mA within an input voltage range of 6V ≤ VSUP ≤ 18V. The
current limitation unit limits the output current for short circuits or overload to 130mA respectively drop-down of the
VCC voltage.

7. Window-Watchdog (only MLX80031/51)
The integrated window watchdog unit observes the correct function of the connected Microcontroller. The required
timing can be programmed with an external resistor connected to the pin RB WD. This resistor defines together with an
internal capacitor the watchdog oscillator frequency. The watchdog is re-triggered by the Microcontroller via the NWDI
input. The watchdog status is represented by the NRES pin.
Negative edges on NWDI reset the watchdog timer. If no pulse is received at NWDI, the MLX80051/31 generates low
pulses on the NRES output with a pulse width of t WDres and a period of tWDper.
7.1. MLX80031/51 Watchdog Behaviour
After power-on and elapsed reset time tres, the window watchdog starts operation with a rising edge on pin NRES. This
start is independent from Standby or Normal Mode.

After tres the window watchdog unit starts with the Lead Time State. In this state the watchdog clock periods (1/f wdosc)
are counted 7895(=nlead) times. A falling edge on NWDI pin within this lead time stops the lead counter and activates
the Closed Window State with ncw=1053. Thereafter follows the Open Window State with counter start value of
now=1105. In case the lead counter elapses, the watchdog enters the Reset State and starts the reset timer with time
tres.
Close Window State and Open Window State are the normal states of the window watchdog. At each of these states
runs a counter with the watchdog clock signal. The CWT counter runs always to the end. The watchdog does not trigger
when         the       NWDI       trigger         signal     arrives        within       the   Open           Window    State.
A NWDI trigger pulse outside the Open Window State generates a reset condition and the NRES output switches to low
for the time tWDres (see Figure 12).

7.2. All watchdog start-up scenarios
7.2.1. After power-on and initialization
Watchdog starts after VCC ramp up and elapsed time of reset timer (typ. 4ms) with Lead Time State. MLX80031/51 is in
Standby or Normal Mode.
7.2.2. Wake up indicated transition to Standby Mode from Sleep or Silent
          Mode
Watchdog starts immediately with activation of Standby Mode (SBY_MODE = 1). Waking up from Sleep Mode the VCC
regulator ramps up and the reset timer starts. The reset timer has in this case no influence on the watchdog start.
7.2.3. Undervoltage reset on VCC on Normal Mode or Silent Mode
MLX80031/51 goes to Standby Mode. Running watchdog process is stopped and cleared. With active undervoltage
reset the signal the output pin NRES goes to low. Leaving undervoltage reset starts the reset timer (4ms) and thereafter
starts a new watchdog cycle.
7.2.4. EN indicated transition from Silent Mode to Normal Mode
Mode control changes from Silent Mode to Normal Mode. Watchdog starts immediately with activation of Normal
Mode in Closed Window State.

7.3. Calculation of Watchdog Period
The RC-oscillator of MLX80031/51 which generates the responsible timing of the watchdog has a tolerance of ±15%.
This has the consequence that also the watchdog window times t CW and tOW variants with this tolerance.

                                      Figure 13: Watchdog open and close window tolerances
The ideal watchdog period can be calculated with:
                           1
         tWD_id  tCW        tOW
                           2
The average value tWD of the real usable watchdog trigger time under consideration of the oscillator tolerance is:
         tWD  (tCW min  tOW min  t CW max) 2                             [EQ1]
The allowed tolerance tWD is:
         tWD  (tCW min  tOW min  t CW max) 2                            [EQ2]
With the definition of tCW = ncw * (1± TOL) * tWDOSC and tOW = now * (1± TOL) * tWDOSC from [EQ1] tWD can be calculated
with:
         tWD  tWDOSC (2  ncw  now  ( 1  TOL)) 2                        [EQ3]
and with [EQ2]:
         tWD  tWDOSC (now  ( 1  TOL)  2  TOL  ncw) 2                 [EQ4]
The variation ΔtWD will be normalized to the mean value tWD and both counter values set in a relationship of
a=now/ncw, then follows for the relative deviation:
                    a  (1  TOL)  2  TOL
         tWDTOL                                                            [EQ5]
                         2  a  (1  TOL)
The watchdog trigger time as well as the tolerance depends only on the oscillator frequency respectively the period
tWDOSC, if there are fixed values for both counters (ncw and now) and oscillator tolerance.
Implemented in MLX80031/51 is a precision RC oscillator with a tolerance of TOL = 15%. Combined with the relation
of counter values a=1.04 reached them a tolerance of trigger time of 20%.

8. Fail-safe features
Loss of battery
If the ECU is disconnected from the battery, the LIN bus pin is in high impedance state. There is no impact to the bus
traffic and to the ECU itself. Reverse current is limited to < 20µA
Loss of Ground
In case of an interrupted ECU ground connection there is no influence to the bus line. The current from the ECU to the
LIN bus is limited by the weak pull up resistor of the pin LIN. The slave termination resistor is disconnected in order to
fulfil the SAE J2602 requirements for the loss of ground current (<100µA @12V).
Short circuit to battery
The transmitter output current is limited to the specified value in case of short circuit to battery in order to prevent
high current densities and thermal hot spots in the LIN driver.
Short circuit to ground
If the LIN bus wiring is shorted to negative shifted ground levels, there is no current flow from the ECU ground to the
bus and no distortion of the bus traffic occurs.
If the controller detects a short circuit of the LIN bus to ground the transceiver can be set into sleep mode. Additionally
the internal slave termination resistor is switched off and only a weak pull up termination is applied to the LIN bus (typ.
50µA). If the failure disappears, the bus level will become recessive again and will wake up the system even if no local
wake up occurs or is possible.
Thermal overload
All MLX8003x/5x versions are protected against thermal overloads. If the chip temperature exceeds the specified value,
the transmitter is disabled until thermal recovery and the following recessive to dominant transition on pin TxD. The
receiver is still working while thermal shutdown.
Undervoltage lock out
If the battery supply voltage is missing or decreases below the specified value (VS_UV), the transmitter is disabled to
prevent undefined bus traffic. While in sleep mode, the MLX8003x/5x enters the Standby Mode if Vs drops below the

Open Circuit protection
•          The pin TxD provides a pull up resistor to VCC. The transmitter cannot be enabled.
•          The pin EN provides a pull down resistor to prevent undefined normal mode transitions.
•          The pin NWDI provides a pull up resistor to VCC. The window watchdog generates NRES pulse.
•          The pin MODE provides a pull down resistor to GND. No influence on window watchdog.
•          If the battery supply voltage is disconnected, the pin RxD is floating.
•          The pin WAKE provides a weak pull up current towards supply voltage Vs to prevent
           local wake-up requests.
•          The pin KL15 provides a weak pull down current towards GND to prevent local wake-up requests.
Short circuit RxD, NRES against GND or VCC
Both outputs are short circuit proof to VCC and ground.

9.1. Safe Operating Area
The linear regulator of the MLX8003x/5x operates with input voltages up to 27 V and can output a current of 70 mA.
The maximum power dissipation limits the maximum output current at high input voltages and high ambient tempera-
tures. The output current of 70 mA at an ambient temperature of TA = 125°C is only possible with small voltage differ-
ences between VS and VCC.

To minimize the influence of EMI on the bus line an 220pF capacitor should be connected directly to the LIN pin (see
Figure 17). This EMI-Filter assures that the RF injection into the IC from the LIN bus line has no effect or will be limited.
It is also possible to use LC- or RC-filters. The dimensions of C-L or R-L depend on the corner frequency, the maximum
LIN bus capacitance (10nF) and the compliance with the DC- and AC LIN bus parameters.

10. ESD and EMC
10.1. Recommendations for Actuator products
In order to minimize EMC influences, the PCB has to be designed according to EMC guidelines. Actuators products are
ESD sensitive devices and have to be handled according to the rules in IEC61340-5-2.
Actuators products will apply the requirements in the application according to the specification, to ISO7637-2, -3 and
ISO16750-2.
Prototype samples of actuators products will be evaluated according AEC-Q100-002. The result will be published after
qualification. After ESD stress single parameters may be shifted out of their limit, but IC function will still be correctly.
10.1.1. Automotive Qualification Test Pulses
That means that automotive test pulses are applied to the module in the application environment and not to the single
IC. Therefore attention must be taken, that only protected pins (protection by means of the IC itself or by means of
external components) are wired to a module connector. In the recommended application diagrams, the reverse polarity
diode together with the capacitors on supply pins, the protection resistors in several lines and the load dump protected
IC itself will protect the module against the below listed automotive test pulses. The exact value of the capacitors for
the application has to be figured out during design-in of the product according to the automotive requirements.
For the LIN pin the specification “LIN Physical Layer Spec 2.1 (Nov. 24, 2006)” is valid.
Supply Pin VS is protected via the reverse polarity diode and the supply capacitors. No damage will occur for defined
test pulses. A deviation of characteristics is allowed during pulse 1 and 2; but the module will recover to the normal
function after the pulse without any additional action. During test pulse 3a, 3b, 5 the module will work within charac-
teristic limits.

Description of functional state
A:       All functions of the device are performed as designed during and after the disturbance occurs.
B:       All functions of the device are performed as designed during the disturbance occurs. One or more functions
         can violate the specified tolerances. All functions return automatically within their normal limits after the dis-
         turbances is removed..
C:       A function of a device does not perform as designed during the disturbance occurs but returns automatically
         to the normal operation after the disturbances is removed.
D:       A function of a device does not perform as designed during the disturbance occurs and does not return auto-
         matically to the normal operation after the disturbances is removed. The device needs to be reset by a simple
         operation/action to return to the specified limits/function.
