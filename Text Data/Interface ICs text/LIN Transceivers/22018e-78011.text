1.5.9        RESET
RESET is an open-drain output pin. This pin tracks an
internal signal that tracks the internal system voltage
has reached a valid, stable level. As long as the internal
voltage is valid, this pin will remain high (‘1’). When the
system voltage drops below the minimum required, the
voltage regulator will shut down and immediately
convert the RESET output to (‘0’). When connected to
a micro-controller input, this can provide a warning that
the voltage regulator is shutting down (see Example 1-
2). Alternately, it can act as an external brown-out by
connecting the RESET output to MCLR (see
Example 1-3). In addition to monitoring the internal
voltage, RESET is asserted immediately upon entering
the Powerdown mode.

1.7     ICSP™ Considerations
The following should be considered when the
MCP2021/2 is connected to pins supporting in-circuit
programming:
• Power used for programming the microcontroller
  can be supplied from the programmer, or from the
  MCP2021/2.
• The voltage on VREG should not exceed the
  maximum output voltage of VREG.

 Note 1:    The maximum power dissipation is a function of TJMAX, ΘJA and ambient temperature TA. The maximum
            allowable power dissipation at an ambient temperature is PD = (TJMAX - TA) ΘJA. If this dissipation is
            exceeded, the die temperature will rise above 150°C and the MCP2021 will go into thermal shutdown.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
