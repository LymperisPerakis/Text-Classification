NCV7321
Stand-alone LIN Transceiver
Description
   The NCV7321 is a fully featured local interconnect network (LIN)
transceiver designed to interface between a LIN protocol controller
and the physical bus. The transceiver is implemented in I3T
technology enabling both high−voltage analog circuitry and digital
                                                                                             www.onsemi.com

   The NCV7321 LIN device is a member of the in−vehicle
networking (IVN) transceiver family.                                                                                 MARKING

   The LIN bus is designed to communicate low rate data from control
devices such as door locks, mirrors, car seats, and sunroofs at the                                                8
lowest possible cost. The bus is designed to eliminate as much wiring                            SOIC−8                NV7321−x

Functional operation above the stresses listed in the Recommended Operating Ranges is not implied. Extended exposure to stresses beyond
the Recommended Operating Ranges limits may affect device reliability.
1. Below 5 V on VBB in normal mode, the bus will either stay recessive or comply with the voltage level specifications and transition time
    specifications as required by SAE J2602. It is ensured by the battery monitoring circuit. Above 27 V on VBB, LIN communication is operational
    (LIN pin toggling) but parameters cannot be guaranteed. For higher battery voltage operation above 27 V, LIN pull−up resistor must be
    selected large enough to avoid clamping of LIN pin by voltage drop over external pull−up resistor and LIN pin min current limitation.
2. Equivalent to discharging a 100 pF capacitor through a 1.5 kW resistor conform to MIL STD 883 method 3015.7.
3. Equivalent to discharging a 150 pF capacitor through a 330 W resistor. System HBM levels are verified by an external test−house.
4. Direct Capacitor Coupling (DCC) method according to SAE J2962−1 specification, referring to ISO 7637−3 Slow Transient Pulse. Coupling
