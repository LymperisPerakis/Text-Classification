                                                        The STLD1 line driver is a low-distortion, high-current dual power amplifier
                                                        specifically designed for power-line communication applications, where high output
                                                        current drives the AC power-line loads.
               Product status link                      Operating on a single 8-18 V supply, the STLD1 can deliver high output current up to
                                                        1.5 ARMS and an output voltage swing-up to 18 V peak-to-peak single-ended / 36 V

5               Device characteristics
5.1             Thermal protection
                Any overtemperature event forces the line driver to self-disable the power amplifiers, thus preventing the STLD1
                from damage. The thermal feedback is provided on THERM pin by a current that is N times the IBIAS_IN input
                current, according to the relationship described in the following table.
                                               Table 7. Thermal current level vs. junction temperature
                                I(THERMAL)                                          Junction temperature level
                               0 x I(IBIAS_IN)                                                Tj < T1
                               1 x I(IBIAS_IN)                                             T1 < Tj < T2
                               2 x I(IBIAS_IN)                                             T2 < Tj < T3
                               3 x I(IBIAS_IN)                                             T3 < Tj < T4
                               4 x I(IBIAS_IN)                                                Tj > T4
5.2             Current feedback
                Current sense feedback is provided by CSF_OUT current output, proportional to the LD output current. The
                CSF_OUT current is converted into voltage by a resistor and compared with the current limit threshold set at
                system level.
5.3             Power management
                The STLD1 operates from a single 8-18 V external supply. It directly supplies the power amplifiers and the internal
                5 V linear regulator for the analog and control circuitry. The block diagram for the power management is shown in
                the figure below.
