Description
The TLE7269G is a transceiver for the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) with integrated Wake-Up and
protection features. It is designed for in-vehicle networks using data transmission rates from 2.4 kBaud to
20 kBaud. The TLE7269G functions as a bus driver between the protocol controller and the physical bus inside
the LIN network. Compliant to all LIN standards and with a wide operational supply range the TLE7269G can
be used in all automotive applications.
Two stand-alone LIN transceivers are integrated on one monolithic circuit inside TLE7269G. Both transceivers
offer different operation modes and separate INH outputs to control external circuitry, like voltage regulators.
In Sleep-mode the TLE7269G draws less than 10 mA of quiescent current for both integrated LIN Transceivers,
while both transceivers are still able to wake up off of LIN bus traffic or the local Wake-Up input. The very low

TLE7269G
Twin LIN Transceiver
Functional Description
4              Functional Description
The LIN Bus is a single wire, bi-directional bus, used for in-vehicle networks. The LIN Transceiver TLE7269G is
the interface between the microcontroller and the physical LIN Bus (see Figure 17 and Figure 18). The logical
values of the microcontroller are driven to the LIN bus via the TxD inputs of the TLE7269G. The transmit data
stream on the TxD input is converted to a LIN bus signal with optimized slew rate to minimize the EME level of the
LIN network. The RxD outputs read back the information from the LIN bus to the microcontroller. The receiver has
an integrated filter network to suppress noise on the LIN Bus and to increase the EMI (Electro Magnetic Immunity)
level of the transceiver.
Two logical states are possible on the LIN bus according to the LIN Specification 2.1 (see Figure 3):
In dominant state, the voltage on the LIN bus is set to the GND level. In recessive state, the voltage on the LIN
bus is set to the supply voltage VS. By setting the TxD1, TxD2 inputs of the TLE7269G to “Low” the transceiver
generates a dominant level on the BUS1, BUS2 LIN interface pins. The RxD1, RxD2 outputs read back the signal
on the LIN bus and indicate a dominant signal on the LIN bus with a logical “Low” to the microcontroller. Setting
the TXD1, TxD2 pins to “High” the transceiver TLE7269G sets the BUS1, BUS2 LIN interface pins to recessive
level, at the same time the recessive level on the LIN bus is indicated by a logical “High” on the RxD1, RxD2
outputs.
Every LIN network consists of a master node and one or more slave nodes. To configure the TLE7269G for master
node applications, a resistor in the range of 1 kΩ and a reverse diode must be connected between the LIN bus
and the power supply VS or between the LIN bus and INH pin of the TLE7269G (see Figure 17 and Figure 18).
Both integrated transceivers can operate independent from each other and several operation modes and Wake-
Up functions are implemented. The bus Wake-Up function of the transceiver 2 can be turned off via the W2O pin.

TLE7269G
Twin LIN Transceiver
Functional Description
•   Stand-By mode
•   Normal Operation mode
•   Sleep mode
The Normal Operation mode contains 3 sub-operation modes, which differentiate by the slew rate control of the
LIN Bus signal (see Figure 4).
Sub-operation modes with different slew rates on the BUS1,BUS2 pins:
•   Low Slope mode, for data transmission rates up to 10.4 kBaud
•   Normal Slope mode, for data transmission rates up to 20 kBaud
•   Flash mode, for programming of the external microcontroller
The TLE7269G contains 2 separate LIN transceivers, which are able to operate in two independent LIN networks
with two different data transmission rates. The operation mode of the TLE7269G is selected by the EN pin and the
TxD1 pin. Selecting the operation mode applies to the whole device. Transceiver1 and transceiver2 are always
set to the same operation mode and sub-operation mode (see Figure 4).

1) To indicate the Wake-Up sources via the RxD pins the power supply VIO has to be present
2) The TxD1 input needs an external termination to indicate a “High” or a “Low” signal. The external termination could be a
    pull-up resistor or an active microcontroller output.
4.2            Normal Operation Mode
The TLE7269G enters the Normal Operation mode after the microcontroller sets EN to “High” (see Figure 4). In
Normal Operation mode both LIN bus receivers and both LIN bus transmitters are active. Data from the
microcontroller is transmitted to the LIN bus1 or LIN bus2 via the TxD1 or TxD2 pin, the receiver detects the data
stream on the LIN bus1 or bus2 and forwards it to the RxD1 or RxD2 output pins. In Normal Operation mode, the
INH1 pin and the INH2 are “High” (set to VS) and the bus termination is set to 30 kΩ for both integrated transceivers.
Normal Slope mode, Low Slope mode and the Flash mode are Normal Operation modes and in these sub-modes
the behavior of the INH pin and the bus termination is the same. To set the device into one of these 3 sub-modes
the TxD1 pin and the EN pin are used for the sub-operation mode selection. In order to avoid any bus disturbance
during a mode change, the output stages of the TLE7269G are disabled and set to recessive state during the
mode change procedure. To release the TLE7269G for data communication on the LIN bus1 and LIN bus2, the
TxD1 and TxD2 pins need to be set to “High” for the time tto,rec.

TLE7269G
Twin LIN Transceiver
Functional Description
4.2.1          Normal Slope Mode
In Normal Slope mode data transmission rates up to 20 kBauds are possible. Setting the EN pin to “High” starts
the transition to Normal Operation mode. Depending on the signal on the TxD1 pin, the TLE7269G changes either
into Normal Slope mode or Low Slope mode (see Figure 5).
The mode change to Normal Slope mode is defined by the time tMODE and the time tTXD,SET. The time tMODE
specifies the delay time between the threshold, where the EN pin detects a “High” input signal, and the actual
mode change of TLE7269G into Normal Slope mode. The time tTXD,SET defines the setup time in which the TxD1
pin has be set to “High”. After the time tTXD,SET expires, the logical “High” signal on the TxD1 pin has to be stable
to put the part into Normal Slope mode.
In the time window tMODE - tTXD,SET the TLE7269G makes the transition to Normal Slope mode but remains in Stand-
By mode until the time tMODE expires.
Finally to release the data communication it is required to set the TxD1 and the TxD2 pin to “High” for the time tto,rec.

4.2.2          Low Slope Mode
In Low Slope mode data transmission rates up to 10.4 kBauds are possible. Setting the EN pin to “High” starts the
transition to Normal Operation mode. Depending on the signal of the TxD1 pin the TLE7269G changes either into
Normal Slope mode or Low Slope mode (see Figure 6).
The mode change to Low Slope mode is defined by the time tMODE and the time tTXD,SET. The time tMODE specifies
the delay time between the threshold, where the EN pin detects a “High” input signal, and the actual mode change
of TLE7269G to Low Slope mode. The time tTXD,SET defines the setup time in which the TxD1 pin can be set to
“Low”. After the time tTXD,SET expires, the logical “Low” signal on the TxD1 pin has to be stable to put the part into
Low Slope mode.
In the time window tMODE - tTXD,SET the TLE7269G makes the transition into Low Slope mode but remains in Stand-
By mode until the time tMODE expires.
Finally to release the data communication it is required to set the TxD1 and the TxD2 pin to “High” for the time tto,rec.

4.2.3          Flash Mode
In Flash mode it is possible to transmit and receive LIN messages on the LIN bus. The slew rate control
mechanism of the LIN bus signal is disabled. This allows higher data transmission rates, disregarding the EMC
limitations of the LIN network. The Flash mode is intended to be used during the ECU production for programming
the microcontroller via the LIN bus interface.
The TLE7269G can be set to Flash mode either from Normal Slope mode or from Low Slope mode (see Figure 4).
Flash mode is entered by setting the EN pin to “Low” for the time tfl1 and generating a falling and a rising edge at
the TxD1 pin with the timing tfl2, tfl3 and tfl4 (see Figure 7). Leaving the Flash mode by the same sequence, sets
the TLE7269G back to its previous state, be that either Normal Slope mode or Low Slope mode. Finally to release
the data transmission it is required to set the TxD1 pin and the TxD2 pin to “High” for the time tto,rec.
The TLE7269G can be set from Flash mode directly to Sleep mode by switching the EN pin to “Low”. Setting the
pin EN to “High” again, the device will return to Flash mode.

TLE7269G
Twin LIN Transceiver
Functional Description
•   A Power-Up event on the supply VS.
•   A bus Wake-Up event on pin BUS1 or pin BUS2.
•   A local Wake-Up event on the pin WK.
•   A power on reset caused by power supply VS or by the power supply VIO
•   In Stand-By mode the Wake-Up sources are monitored by the TxD1, RxD1 and RxD2 pins.
In Stand-By mode no communication on the LIN Bus is possible. The output stages are disabled and the LIN Bus
termination remains activated on both integrated transceivers. Only the RxD1, RxD2 and the TxD1 pin are used
to indicate the Wake-Up source. The TxD2 pin remains inactive. The RxD1 pin remains “Low” after a local Wake-
Up event on the pin WK and a bus Wake-Up event on either the bus 1 or the bus 2. The RxD2 pin remains “Low”
only after a bus Wake-Up event on the bus 2. A Power-Up event is indicated by a logical “High” on the RxD1 pin.
The signal on the TxD1 pin indicates the Wake-Up source, a weak pull-down signals a bus Wake-Up event on the
bus 1 and bus 2 and a strong pull-down signals a local Wake-Up event caused by the WK pin (see Table 2 and
Table 3). In order to detect a Wake-Up event via the TxD1 pin, the external microcontroller output needs to provide
a logical “High” signal. The Wake-Up flags indicating the Wake-Up source on the pins TxD1, RxD1 and RxD2 are
reset by changing the operation mode to Normal Operation mode.
The signal on the EN pin remains “Low” due to an internal pull-down resistor. Setting the EN pin to “High”, by the
microcontroller returns the TLE7269G to Normal Operation mode. In Stand-By mode the INH1 and INH2 outputs
are switching to VS. The INH outputs can be used to control external device like a voltage regulator.

1) To indicate the Wake-Up or Power-Up event on the RxD pin, the supply VIO has to be present
2) The TxD1 input needs an external termination to indicate a “High” or a “Low” signal. The external termination could be a
    pull-up resistor or an active microcontroller output.
3) A local Wake-Up event is considered after a low signal on the pin WK (see Chapter 4.8).
4) A bus Wake-Up event is considered after the low to high transition on the bus (see Chapter 4.7).
Note: In the case of a sequence of Wake-Up events only the first Wake-Up event will be monitored on TxD1, RxD1
       and RxD2. Subsequent Wake-Up events are ignored.

TLE7269G
Twin LIN Transceiver
Functional Description
4.4           Sleep Mode
In order to reduce the current consumption the TLE7269G offers a Sleep mode. In Sleep mode the quiescent
current on VS and the leakage current on the pins BUS1 and BUS2 are cut back to a minimum.
To switch the TLE7269G from Normal Operation mode to Sleep mode, the EN pin has to be set to “Low”.
Conversely a logical “High” on the EN pin sets the device directly back to Normal Operation mode (see Figure 4).
While the TLE7269G is in Sleep mode the following functions are available:
•   The output stages are disabled and the internal bus terminations are switched off (High Impedance on the pins
    BUS1 and BUS2). Internal current sources on the bus pins ensure that the levels on the pins BUS1 and BUS2
    remain recessive and protect the LIN network against accidental bus Wake-Up events.
•   The receiver stages are turned off.
•   RxD1, RxD2 output pins are inactive and “High resistive”. The TxD1, TxD2 pins are disabled. The logical state
    on the TxD1 pin and the TxD2 pin is “Low” due to the internal pull-down resistors.
•   The INH1 and INH2 outputs are switched off and floating.
•   The bus Wake-Up comparator is active and turns the TLE7269G to Stand-By mode in case of a bus Wake-Up
    event.
•   The WK pin is active and turns the TLE7269G to Stand-By mode in case of a local Wake-Up.
•   The EN pin remains active, switching the EN pin to “High” changes the operation mode to Normal Operation
    mode.
4.5           Wake-Up Events
A Wake-Up event changes the operation mode of the TLE7269G from Sleep mode to Stand-By mode. Both
integrated transceivers are changing the mode.
There are 4 different ways to Wake-Up the TLE7269G from Sleep mode.
•   Bus or also called remote Wake-Up via a dominant signal on the pin BUS1.
•   Bus or also called remote Wake-Up via a dominant signal on the pin BUS2.
•   Local Wake-Up via a minimum dominant time (tWK) on the WK pin.
•   Mode change from Sleep mode to Normal Operation mode, by setting EN pin to logical “High”.
4.6           Wake-Up Bus2 Off
A Wake-Up event on the LIN bus1 or on the bus2 wakes up the TLE7269G and sets it to Stand-By mode. In
applications where a Wake-Up via bus1 is required but a Wake-Up via bus2 is not wanted, the bus Wake-Up event
on the BUS2 can be disabled. This is done by setting the W2O pin to “High”. During the mode change from Normal
Operation mode to Sleep mode the TLE7269G checks for the status on the pin W2O. In case the W2O pin is
“High”, the Wake-Up feature for the transceiver 2 will be disabled. The TLE7269G can still be wake off by a bus
Wake-Up event on LIN bus1 or by a local Wake-Up event on the pin WK. A bus Wake-Up event on the bus 2 won’t
be recognized and the device remains in Sleep mode (see Figure 4).
In case the Wake-Up Bus2 Off feature is not used, the W2O pin can be left open, due to the internal pull-down
resistor, a not connected W2O pin is set to logical “Low”. The function of the EN pin remain unchanged.

Figure 8      Bus Wake-Up behavior
The bus Wake-Up event, often called remote Wake-Up, changes the operation mode from Sleep mode to Stand-
By mode. The TLE7269G wakes-up via a bus Wake-Up event on either the pin BUS1 or BUS2. The bus Wake-
Up behavior is identical on both pins. A falling edge on the LIN bus, followed by a dominant bus signal t > tWK,bus
results in a bus Wake-Up event. The mode change to Stand-By mode becomes active with the following rising
edge on the LIN bus. The TLE7269G remains in Sleep mode until it detects a change from dominant to recessive
on the LIN bus (see Figure 8).
In Stand-By mode the TxD1 pin indicates the source of the Wake-Up event, the TxD2 pin remains inactive. A weak
pull-down on the pin TxD1 indicates a bus Wake-Up event (see Figure 4 or Table 2). The RxD1 pin signals if a
Wake-Up event occurred or the power-up event. A “Low” signal on the RxD1 pin reports a local or bus Wake-Up
event, a logical “High“ signal on RxD1 indicates a power-up event. A “Low” signal on the RxD2 pin indicates a
Wake-Up event on the pin BUS2.

Figure 9      Local Wake-Up behavior
Beside the remote Wake-Up, a Wake-Up of the TLE7269G via the WK pin is possible. This type of Wake-Up event
is called “Local Wake Up”. A falling edge on the WK pin followed by a “Low” signal for t > tWK results in a local
Wake-Up (see Figure 9) and changes the operation mode to Stand-By mode.
In Stand-By mode the TxD1 pin indicates the source of the Wake-Up event, the TxD2 pin remains inactive. A
strong pull-down on the pin TxD1 indicates a bus Wake-Up event (see Figure 4). The RxD1 pin signals if a Wake-
Up event or the Power-Up event occurred. A “Low” signal on the RxD1 pin reports a local or bus Wake-Up event,
a logical “High” signal on RxD1 indicates a Power-Up event. A “Low” signal on the RxD2 pin indicates a Wake-Up
event on the pin BUS2.

It is also possible to change from Sleep mode to Normal Operation mode by setting the EN pin to logical
“High”.This feature is useful if the external microcontroller is continuously powered and not connected to the INH1
pin or the INH2 pin. The EN pin has an integrated pull-down resistor to ensure the device remains in Sleep or
Stand-By mode even if the voltage on the EN pin is floating. The EN pin has an integrated hysteresis to avoid the
toggling of the operation modes during the transition of the EN signal (see Figure 10).
A transition from logical “High” to logical “Low” on the EN pin changes the operation mode from Normal Operation
mode to Sleep mode. If the TLE7269G is already in Sleep mode, changing the EN from “Low” to “High” results into

Figure 11    Power-on reset and Under-Voltage situation
A dropping power supply VS or a dropping microcontroller supply VIO on a local ECU can effect the communication
of the whole LIN network. To avoid any blocking of the LIN network by a local ECU the TLE7269G has an
integrated Power-On reset at the supply VS and an Under-Voltage detection at the supply VS and the supply VIO.
In case the supply voltage VS is dropping below the Power-On reset level VS < VS,UV,PON, the TLE7269G changes
the operation mode to Stand-By mode. In Stand-By mode the output stage of the TLE7269G is disabled and no
communication to the LIN bus is possible. The internal bus termination remains active as well as the INH pins (see
Figure 11 and Figure 4).
In Stand-By mode the RxD1 pin signals the low power supply condition with a “High” signal. A logical “High” on
the EN pin changes the operation mode back to Normal Operation mode.
In case the supply voltage VS is dropping below the specified operation range (see Table 5), the TLE7269G
disables the output and receiver stages. This feature secures the communication on the LIN bus. If the power

If the power supply VIO drops below the Under-Voltage level VIO > VIO,UV the output and receiver stages will be
disabled as well. When VIO reaches a higher level as the Under-Voltage VIO > VIO,UV level the TLE7269G continues
with normal operation and data transmission.
4.11          TxD Time Out function
If the TxD1 or TxD2 signal is dominant for a time t > ttimeout the TxD time-out function deactivates the transmission
of the LIN signal to the bus and disables both, the output stage 1 and the output stage 2. This is realized to prevent
the bus from being blocked by a permanent “Low” signal on the TxD1 or TxD2 pin, caused by an error on the
external microcontroller (see Figure 12).
The transmission is released again, after a rising edge at TxD1 or TxD2 has been detected.

both output stages (see Figure 1). An over temperature event will not cause any mode change nor will it be

Functional Description
level TJ < TjSD, the output stages are re-enabled and data communication can start again on BUS1 and BUS2. A
10°C hysteresis avoids toggling during the temperature shut down.
4.13           3.3 V and 5 V Logic Capability
The TLE7269G can be used for 3.3 V and 5 V microcontrollers. The inputs and the outputs are capable to operate
with both voltage levels. The logic level is defined by suppling 3.3V or 5V to the VIO. The inputs (TxD1, TxD2) take
the reference voltage from the VIO pin. The RxD1 output and RxD2 output are push-pull outputs, they work on the
voltage given by VIO pin. No external pull-up resistors are required.
The pin EN works without the voltage on the microcontroller supply VIO. The TLE7269G can be set from Sleep
mode to Normal Operation mode by setting EN to “High”, without supplying VIO.
4.14           BUS Short to GND Feature
The TLE7269G has a feature implemented to protect the battery from running out of charge in the case of BUS
short to GND failure.
In this failure case a normal master termination, a 1 kΩ resistor and diode between the LIN bus and the power
supply VS, would cause a constantly drawn current even in sleep mode. The resulting resistance of this short to
GND is in the range 1 kΩ. To avoid this current during a generator off state, like in a parked car, the TLE7269G
has a bus short to GND feature implemented, which is activated in Sleep mode.
This feature is only applicable, if the master termination of BUS1 is connected to INH1 pin and the master
termination of BUS2 is connected to INH2 pin, instead of being connected to the power supply VS (see Figure 17
and Figure 18). Internally, the 30 kΩ path is also switched off from the power supply VS (see Figure 1).
A separate Master Termination Switch is implemented at pins BUS1 and BUS2, to avoid a voltage drop on the
recessive level of LIN bus, in case of a dominant level or a short to ground on at the LIN bus.
4.15           LIN Specifications 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 and 2.1
The device fulfills the Physical Layer Specification of LIN 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 and 2.1.
The differences between LIN specification 1.2 and 1.3 is mainly the physical layer specification. The reason was
to improve the compatibility between the nodes.
The LIN specification 2.0 is a super set of the 1.3 version. The 2.0 version offers new features. However, it is
possible to use the LIN 1.3 slave node in a 2.0 node cluster, as long as the new features are not used. Vice versa
it is possible to use a LIN 2.0 node in the 1.3 cluster without using the new features.
In terms of the physical layer the LIN 2.1 Specification doesn’t include any changes and is fully compliant to the
LIN Specification 2.0.
LIN 2.1 is the latest version of the LIN specification, released in December 2006.

7.2           Pin Compatibility to the Single LIN Transceivers
The Twin LIN Transceiver TLE7269G is pin and function compatible to Single LIN Transceivers like the TLE7259-
3GE, the TLE7258 and the TLE7257. The TLE7269G has a pin for the VIO supply. This supply pin is usually
connected to the power supply of the external microcontroller. The Single LIN Transceivers don’t have a VIO pin.
In order to provide the same functions, these Single LIN transceiver need an external pull-up resistor at the RxD
pin towards the microcontroller supply VIO.
Additionally the TLE7258 and the TLE7257 has no local Wake-Up Pin. Pin 3 is N.C. at these devices.

Application Information
7.3           Master Termination
To achieve the required timings for the dominant to recessive transition of the bus signal an additional external
termination resistor of 1 kΩ is mandatory. It is recommended to place this resistor at the master node. To avoid
reverse currents from the bus line into the battery supply line it is recommended to place a diode in series with the
external pull-up. For small systems (low bus capacitance) the EMC performance of the system is supported by an
additional capacitor of at least 1 nF at the master node (see Figure 17 and Figure 18).The values for the Master
Termination resistor and the bus capacitance influence the performance of the LIN network. They depend on the
number of nodes inside the LIN network and on the parasitic cable capacitances of the LIN bus wiring.
7.4           External Capacitors
A capacitor of 10 μF at the supply voltage input VS buffers the input voltage. In combination with the required
reverse polarity diode this prevents the device from detecting a power down conditions in case of negative
transients on the supply line (see Figure 17 and Figure 18).
The 100 nF capacitor close to the VS pin and a 33 nF capacitor close to the VIO pin of the TLE7269G are required
to get the best EMC performance.
