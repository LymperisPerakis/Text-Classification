Monitoring is then done by requiring the host processor to
force a falling edge transition on the WWDTTRIG pin
within a predetermined time frame (TWD).
The start time of the trigger window is fixed at 50% of
the total watchdog period, after the last trigger. The
length of the window is determined by the value of the
resistor on pin WWDTSELECT. The Watchdog Timer is
disabled if WWDTSELECT is floating.

       after the falling edge is detected for approximately
       tWDRST; the counter is reset and the next watchdog
       period begins at the rising edge of the voltage on
       WWDTRESET pin (Figure 1-12).
    • No pulse on the WWDTTRIG pin is detected
       during the whole watchdog window (no trigger);
       WWDTRESET is asserted (low) for approximately
       tWDRST when the timer has expired; the counter is
       reset and the next watchdog period begins at the
       rising edge of the voltage on WWDTRESET pin
       (Figure 1-5).
    The trigger window is between 50% to 100% of the
    watchdog window length, tWLENGTH. The window
    length is determined by the external resistor between
    WWDTSELECT pin and VSS.

1.4.2          THERMAL PROTECTION
The thermal protection circuit monitors the die
temperature and is able to shut down the LIN
transmitter and voltage regulator.
There are three causes for a thermal overload. A thermal
shut down can be triggered by any one, or a combination
of, the following thermal overload conditions.
• Voltage regulator overload
• LIN bus output overload
• Increase in die temperature due to increase in
   environment temperature
The recovery time from the thermal shutdown is equal
to adequate cooling time.
Driving the TXD and checking the RXD pin makes it
possible to determine whether there is a bus contention
(TXD = high, RXD = low) or a thermal overload condition
(TXD = low, RXD = high).

      Note 1: CREG, the load capacitor, should be ceramic or tantalum rated for extended temperatures,
               1.0-22 µF. See Figure 2-1 for selecting the correct ESR.
           2: CBAT is the filter capacitor for the external voltage supply. It’s typically 10 · CREG, with no ESR
               restriction. See Figure 1-11 to select the minimum recommended value for CBAT. The RTP value is
               added to the line resistance.
           3: This diode is only needed if CS/LWAKE is connected to VBAT supply.
           4: ESD protection diode.
           5: This component is for additional load dump protection.
           6: An external 10 kΩ resistor is recommended for some applications.

1.8      ICSP™ Considerations
The following should be considered when the
MCP2050 is connected to pins supporting in-circuit
programming:
• Power used for programming the microcontroller
  can be supplied from the programmer, or from the
  MCP2050.
• The voltage on the VREG pin should not exceed
  the maximum value of VREG as shown in
  Section 2.3, DC Specifications.

Note 1:    The maximum power dissipation is a function of TJMAX, JA and ambient temperature TA. The maximum
           allowable power dissipation at an ambient temperature is PD = (TJMAX - TA)JA. If this dissipation is
           exceeded, the die temperature will rise above 150C and the MCP2050 will go into thermal shutdown.

  Note:                  The graphs and tables provided following this note are a statistical summary based on a limited number of
                         samples and are provided for informational purposes only. The performance characteristics listed herein
                         are not tested or guaranteed. In some graphs or tables, the data presented may be outside the specified

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
