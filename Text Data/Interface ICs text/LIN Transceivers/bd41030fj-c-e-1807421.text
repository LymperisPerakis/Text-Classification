 BD41030FJ-C BD41030HFN-C
Description of Block(s)
1. Sleep mode
     In sleep mode, the transmit/receive function is not available and BD41030FJ-C is under the condition of low power
     consumption mode. In this mode BD41030FJ-C shifts to sleep mode at startup of power supply (VBAT) when NSLP is “L”
     or in normal mode also when pin NSLP is “L”.
     During sleep mode, one of the following wake-up events triggers a shift of state:
     ・Pin NWAKE “H”→“L” (Shift to standby mode)
     ・Pin LIN “H”→“L”→“H” (Shift to standby mode)
     ・Pin NSLP “L”→“H” (Shift to normal mode)
     The above-mentioned wake-up events shift the mode when a state remains for a given period of time (tNWAKE, tBUS,
     tgotonorm). Hereinafter, a wake-up event on pin NWAKE is defined as Local wake-up, and a wake-up event on pin LIN is
     defined as Remote wake-up.
2. Standby mode
     When a wake-up event occurs on pin NWAKE or pin LIN in sleep mode, BD41030FJ-C shifts to standby mode.
     In standby mode, pins become the following state:
     ・Pin INH “H” (≒VBAT voltage)
     ・Pin RXD “L” (Informs the microcontroller of being in standby mode.)
     ・Pin LIN Slave resistor ON
     BD41030FJ-C shifts from standby mode to normal mode when pin NSLP input switches to “H”.
3. Normal mode
     BD41030FJ-C shifts to normal mode when pin NSLP switches to “H” in sleep mode or standby mode. In normal mode,
     data can be transmitted or received through the bus line. When receiving data, the transceiver informs a LIN bus input
     from pin RXD to the microcontroller. When transmitting data, the transceiver converts a TXD input signal to a
     slew-rate-controlled LIN bus signal and informs the bus line of the converted signal. The maximum operating frequency
     in this mode is 10 kHz.
     From this mode, BD41030FJ-C shifts to sleep mode when pin NSLP input switches to “L” and this state remains for a
     given period of time (tgotosleep).
                                                                                        unpower
                                                                                         state

4. TXD dominant time-out counters Fail-safe function
    A TXD dominant time-out counter prevents the bus line from being driven to a permanent dominant state (blocking all
    network communication) in case pin TXD input is forced permanently low by a hardware and/or software application
    failure. The timer is trigged by a negative edge on pin TXD and in case the value exceeds the internal timer value (tdom),
    the transmitter becomes disabled and drives the bus line into a recessive state. The timer is reset by a positive edge on
    pin TXD input.
5. Fail-safe function
    ・Pin TXD provides a pull-down to GND in order to force a predefined level on input pin TXD in case the pin TXD is not
       connected.
    ・Pin NSLP provides a pull-down to GND in order to force the transceiver into sleep mode in case the pin NSLP is not
       connected.
    ・Pin RXD is “Hi-z” in case of lost power supply on pin VBAT.
    ・The output driver at pin LIN will be off when junction temperature exceeds TJ activating the TSD circuit without relation
       to input signal at pin TXD. Because the thermal shut down circuitry has a hysteresis band, junction temperature
       depends on TXD terminal input signal for the LIN terminal output driver again when 15 degrees Celsius (Typ) degree
       falls from detective temperature.

    Caution: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
    between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is operated over
    the absolute maximum ratings.

Operational Notes
      1.   Reverse Connection of Power Supply
           Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
           connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
           supply pins.
      2.   Power Supply Lines
           Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at
           all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic
           capacitors.
      3.   Ground Voltage
           Except for pins the output and the input of which were designed to go below ground, ensure that no pins are at a
           voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
      4.   Ground Wiring Pattern
           When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
           connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
           ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
           on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
      5.   Thermal Consideration
           Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
           deterioration of the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the board size
           and copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
      6.   Recommended Operating Conditions
           These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately
           obtained. The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
      7.   Inrush Current
           When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may
           flow instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
           supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring,
           and routing of connections.
      8.   Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
           Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
      9.   Testing on Application Boards
           When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
           subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
           should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
           process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
           transport and storage.
      10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
           Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
           damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
           Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment)
           and unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
      11. Unused Input Pins
           Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
           extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
           charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
           cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
           power supply or ground line.

Operational Notes – continued
      12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
           This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
           isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
           parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
           When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
           When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
           Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
           interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
           operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should
           be avoided.
                                                    Figure 101. Example of monolithic IC structure
      13. Ceramic Capacitor
           When using a ceramic capacitor, determine the dielectric constant considering the change of capacitance with
           temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
      14. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
           Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and power dissipation are all within the Area of Safe
           Operation (ASO).
      15. Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
           This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always
           be within the IC’s power dissipation rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the junction
           temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF all output pins. When the Tj falls below
           the TSD threshold, the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
           Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
           circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from
           heat damage.

                                     JAPAN                USA                EU              CHINA
                                    CLASSϪ                               CLASSϩb
                                                       CLASSϪ                              CLASSϪ
                                    CLASSϫ                                CLASSϪ
    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are not designed under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below.
        Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the
        use of any ROHM’s Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our
        Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent
        verification and confirmation of product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                   H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification
