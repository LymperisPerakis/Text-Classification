1. Description
   The Atmel® ATA6622C is a fully integrated LIN transceiver, which complies with the LIN 2.0, 2.1 and SAEJ2602-2
   specifications. It has a low-drop voltage regulator for 3.3V/85mA output and a window watchdog. The Atmel ATA6624C has
   the same functionality as the Atmel ATA6622C; however, it uses a 5V/85mA regulator. The Atmel ATA6626C has the same
   functionality as Atmel ATA6624C without a TXD time-out timer. The voltage regulator is able to source 85mA, but the output
   current can be boosted by using an external NPN transistor. This chip combination makes it possible to develop inexpensive,
   simple, yet powerful slave and master nodes for LIN-bus systems. Atmel ATA6622C/ATA6624C/ATA6626C are designed to
   handle the low-speed data communication in vehicles, e.g., in convenience electronics. Improved slope control at the LIN-
   driver ensures secure data communication up to 20kBaud. Sleep Mode and Silent Mode guarantee very low current
   consumption. The Atmel ATA6626C is able to switch the LIN unlimited to dominant level via TXD for low data rates.

3.  Functional Description
3.1 Physical Layer Compatibility
    Since the LIN physical layer is independent from higher LIN layers (e.g., the LIN protocol layer), all nodes with a LIN physical
    layer according to revision 2.x can be mixed with LIN physical layer nodes, which, according to older versions (i.e., LIN 1.0,
    LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3), are without any restrictions.
3.2 Supply Pin (VS)
    The LIN operating voltage is VS = 5V to 27V. An undervoltage detection is implemented to disable data transmission if VS
    falls below VSth < 4V in order to avoid false bus messages. After switching on VS, the IC starts in Fail-safe Mode, and the
    voltage regulator is switched on.
    The supply current is typically 10µA in Sleep Mode and 57µA in Silent Mode.
3.3 Ground Pin (GND)
    The IC does not affect the LIN Bus in the event of GND disconnection. It is able to handle a ground shift up to 11.5% of VS.
    The mandatory system ground is pin 5.
3.4 Voltage Regulator Output Pin (VCC)
    The internal 3.3V/5V voltage regulator is capable of driving loads up to 85mA. It is able to supply the microcontroller and
    other ICs on the PCB and is protected against overloads by means of current limitation and overtemperature shut-down.
    Furthermore, the output voltage is monitored and will cause a reset signal at the NRES output pin if it drops below a defined
    threshold Vthun. To boost up the maximum load current, an external NPN transistor may be used, with its base connected to
    the VCC pin and its emitter connected to PVCC.
3.5 Voltage Regulator Sense Pin (PVCC)
    The PVCC is the sense input pin of the 3.3V/5V voltage regulator. For normal applications (i.e., when only using the internal
    output transistor), this pin is connected to the VCC pin. If an external boosting transistor is used, the PVCC pin must be
    connected to the output of this transistor, i.e., its emitter terminal.
3.6 Bus Pin (LIN)
    A low-side driver with internal current limitation and thermal shutdown and an internal pull-up resistor compliant with the LIN
    2.x specification are implemented. The allowed voltage range is between –27V and +40V. Reverse currents from the LIN
    bus to VS are suppressed, even in the event of GND shifts or battery disconnection. LIN receiver thresholds are compatible
    with the LIN protocol specification. The fall time from recessive to dominant bus state and the rise time from dominant to
    recessive bus state are slope controlled.
3.7 Input/Output Pin (TXD)
    In Normal Mode the TXD pin is the microcontroller interface used to control the state of the LIN output. TXD must be pulled
    to ground in order to have a low LIN-bus. If TXD is high or unconnected (internal pull-up resistor), the LIN output transistor is
    turned off, and the bus is in recessive state. During Fail-safe Mode, this pin is used as output. It is current-limited to < 8mA.
    and is latched to low if the last wake-up event was from pin WAKE or KL_15.
3.8 TXD Dominant Time-out Function
    The TXD input has an internal pull-up resistor. An internal timer prevents the bus line from being driven permanently in
    dominant state. If TXD is forced to low for longer than tDOM > 6ms, the LIN-bus driver is switched to recessive state.
    To reactivate the LIN bus driver, switch TXD to high (> 10µs).
    The time-out function is disabled in the ATA6626C. Switching to dominant level on the LIN bus occurs without any time
    limitations.

    4986O–AUTO–10/14


3.9  Output Pin (RXD)
     This output pin reports the state of the LIN-bus to the microcontroller. LIN high (recessive state) is reported by a high level at
     RXD; LIN low (dominant state) is reported by a low level at RXD. The output has an internal pull-up resistor with typically
     5kΩ to VCC. The AC characteristics can be defined with an external load capacitor of 20pF.
     The output is short-circuit protected. RXD is switched off in Unpowered Mode (i.e., VS = 0V).
3.10 Enable Input Pin (EN)
     The Enable Input pin controls the operation mode of the device. If EN is high, the circuit is in Normal Mode, with transmission
     paths from TXD to LIN and from LIN to RXD both active. The VCC voltage regulator operates with 3.3V/5V/85mA output
     capability.
     If EN is switched to low while TXD is still high, the device is forced to Silent Mode. No data transmission is then possible, and
     the current consumption is reduced to IVS typ. 57µA. The VCC regulator has its full functionality.
     If EN is switched to low while TXD is low, the device is forced to Sleep Mode. No data transmission is possible, and the
     voltage regulator is switched off.
3.11 Wake Input Pin (WAKE)
     The Wake Input pin is a high-voltage input used to wake up the device from Sleep Mode or Silent Mode. It is usually
     connected to an external switch in the application to generate a local wake-up. A pull-up current source, typically 10µA, is
     implemented.
     If a local wake-up is not needed in the application, connect the Wake pin directly to the VS pin.
3.12 Mode Input Pin (MODE)
     Connect the MODE pin directly or via an external resistor to GND for normal watchdog operation. To debug the software of
     the connected microcontroller, connect MODE pin to 3.3V/5V and the watchdog is switched off.
3.13 TM Input Pin
     The TM pin is used for final production measurements at Atmel®. In normal application, it has to be always connected to
     GND.
3.14 KL_15 Pin
     The KL_15 pin is a high-voltage input used to wake up the device from Sleep or Silent Mode. It is an edge sensitive pin (low-
     to-high transition). It is usually connected to ignition to generate a local wake-up in the application when the ignition is
     switched on. Although KL_15 pin is at high voltage (VBatt), it is possible to switch the IC into Sleep or Silent Mode. Connect
     the KL_15 pin directly to GND if you do not need it. A debounce timer with a typical TdbKl_15 of 160µs is implemented.
     The input voltage threshold can be adjusted by varying the external resistor due to the input current IKL_15. To protect this pin
     against voltage transients, a serial resistor of 47kΩ and a ceramic capacitor of 100nF are recommended. With this RC
     combination you can increase the wake-up time TwKL_15 and, therefore, the sensitivity against transients on the ignition
     Kl.15.
     You can also increase the wake-up time using external capacitors with higher values.
3.15 INH Output Pin
     The INH Output pin is used to switch an external voltage regulator on during Normal or Fail-safe Mode. The INH pin is
     switched off in Sleep or Silent Mode. It is possible to switch off the external 1kΩ master resistor via the INH pin for master
     node applications. The INH pin is switched off during VCC undervoltage reset.
3.16 Reset Output Pin (NRES)
     The Reset Output pin, an open drain output, switches to low during VCC undervoltage or a watchdog failure.

3.17 WD_OSC Output Pin
     The WD_OSC Output pin provides a typical voltage of 1.2V, which supplies an external resistor with values between 34kΩ
     and 120kΩ to adjust the watchdog oscillator time.
3.18 NTRIG Input Pin
     The NTRIG Input pin is the trigger input for the window watchdog. A pull-up resistor is implemented. A negative edge triggers
     the watchdog. The trigger signal (low) must exceed a minimum time ttrigmin to generate a watchdog trigger.

4.1 Normal Mode
    This is the normal transmitting and receiving mode of the LIN Interface in accordance with the LIN specification LIN 2.x. The
    voltage regulator is active and can source up to 85mA. The undervoltage detection is activated. The watchdog needs a
    trigger signal from NTRIG to avoid resets at NRES. If NRES is switched to low, the IC changes its state to Fail-safe Mode.
                                                                    ATA6622C/ATA6624C/ATA6626C [DATASHEET]                             7

4.2 Silent Mode
    A falling edge at EN when TXD is high switches the IC into Silent Mode. The TXD Signal has to be logic high during the
    Mode Select window (see Figure 4-2). The transmission path is disabled in Silent Mode. The overall supply current from VBatt
    is a combination of the IVSsi = 57µA plus the VCC regulator output current IVCC.
    The internal slave termination between the LIN pin and the VS pin is disabled in Silent Mode, only a weak pull-up current
    (typically 10µA) between the LIN pin and the VS pin is present. Silent Mode can be activated independently from the actual
    level on the LIN, WAKE, or KL_15 pins.
    If an undervoltage condition occurs, NRES is switched to low, and the IC changes its state to Fail-safe Mode.
    A voltage less than the LIN Pre_Wake detection VLINL at the LIN pin activates the internal LIN receiver and switches on the
    internal slave termination between the LIN pin and the VS pin.

A falling edge at the LIN pin followed by a dominant bus level maintained for a certain time period (> tbus) and the following
rising edge at the LIN pin (see Figure 4-3 on page 9) results in a remote wake-up request. The device switches from Silent
Mode to Fail-safe Mode. The remote wake-up request is indicated by a low level at the RXD pin to interrupt the
microcontroller (see Figure 4-3 on page 9). EN high can be used to switch directly to Normal Mode.

4.3 Sleep Mode
    A falling edge at EN when TXD is low switches the IC into Sleep Mode. The TXD Signal has to be logic low during the Mode
    Select window (Figure 4-4 on page 10). In order to avoid any influence to the LIN-pin during switching into sleep mode it is
    possible to switch the EN up to 3.2 µs earlier to LOW than the TXD. Therefore, the best and easiest way are two falling
    edges at TXD and EN at the same time.The transmission path is disabled in Sleep Mode. The supply current IVSsleep from
    VBatt is typically 10µA.
    The VCC regulator is switched off. NRES and RXD are low. The internal slave termination between the LIN pin and VS pin is
    disabled, only a weak pull-up current (typically 10µA) between the LIN pin and the VS pin is present. Sleep Mode can be
    activated independently from the current level on the LIN, WAKE, or KL_15 pin.
    A voltage less than the LIN Pre_Wake detection VLINL at the LIN pin activates the internal LIN receiver and switches on the
    internal slave termination between the LIN pin and the VS pin.
    A falling edge at the LIN pin followed by a dominant bus level maintained for a certain time period (> tbus) and a following
    rising edge at pin LIN results in a remote wake-up request. The device switches from Sleep Mode to Fail-safe Mode.
    The VCC regulator is activated, and the remote wake-up request is indicated by a low level at the RXD pin to interrupt the
    microcontroller (see Figure 4-5 on page 11).
    EN high can be used to switch directly from Sleep/Silent to Fail-safe Mode. If EN is still high after VCC ramp up and
    undervoltage reset time, the IC switches to the Normal Mode.

4.4 Fail-safe Mode
    The device automatically switches to Fail-safe Mode at system power-up. The voltage regulator is switched on (see Figure
    5-1 on page 13). The NRES output switches to low for tres = 4ms and gives a reset to the microcontroller. LIN communication
    is switched off. The IC stays in this mode until EN is switched to high. The IC then changes to Normal Mode. A power down
    of VBatt (VS < 3.7V) during Silent or Sleep Mode switches the IC into Fail-safe Mode after power up. A low at NRES switches
    into Fail-safe Mode directly. During Fail-safe Mode the TXD pin is an output and signals the last wake-up source.
4.5 Unpowered Mode
    If you connect battery voltage to the application circuit, the voltage at the VS pin increases according to the block capacitor
    (see Figure 5-1 on page 13). After VS is higher than the VS undervoltage threshold VSth, the IC mode changes from
    Unpowered Mode to Fail-safe Mode. The VCC output voltage reaches its nominal value after tVCC. This time, tVCC, depends
    on the VCC capacitor and the load.
    The NRES is low for the reset time delay treset. During this time, treset, no mode change is possible.

5.  Wake-up Scenarios from Silent or Sleep Mode
5.1 Remote Wake-up via Dominant Bus State
    A voltage less than the LIN Pre_Wake detection VLINL at the LIN pin activates the internal LIN receiver.
    A falling edge at the LIN pin followed by a dominant bus level VBUSdom maintained for a certain time period (> tBUS) and a
    rising edge at pin LIN result in a remote wake-up request. The device switches from Silent or Sleep Mode to Fail-safe Mode.
    The VCC voltage regulator is/remains activated, the INH pin is switched to high, and the remote wake-up request is
    indicated by a low level at the RXD pin to generate an interrupt for the microcontroller. A low level at the LIN pin in the
    Normal Mode starts the bus wake-up filtering time, and if the IC is switched to Silent or Sleep Mode, it will receive a wake-up
    after a positive edge at the LIN pin.
5.2 Local Wake-up via Pin WAKE
    A falling edge at the WAKE pin followed by a low level maintained for a certain time period (> tWAKE) results in a local wake-
    up request. The device switches to Fail-safe Mode. The local wake-up request is indicated by a low level at the RXD pin to
    generate an interrupt in the microcontroller and a strong pull down at TXD. When the Wake pin is low, it is possible to switch
    to Silent or Sleep Mode via pin EN. In this case, the wake-up signal has to be switched to high > 10µs before the negative
    edge at WAKE starts a new local wake-up request.
5.3 Local Wake-up via Pin KL_15
    A positive edge at pin KL_15 followed by a high voltage level for a certain time period (> tKL_15) results in a local wake-up
    request. The device switches into the Fail-safe Mode. The extra long wake-up time ensures that no transients at KL_15
    create a wake up. The local wake-up request is indicated by a low level at the RXD pin to generate an interrupt for the
    microcontroller and a strong pull down at TXD. During high-level voltage at pin KL_15, it is possible to switch to Silent or
    Sleep Mode via pin EN. In this case, the wake-up signal has to be switched to low > 250µs before the positive edge at KL_15
    starts a new local wake-up request. With external RC combination, the time is even longer.
5.4 Wake-up Source Recognition
    The device can distinguish between a local wake-up request (Wake or KL_15 pins) and a remote wake-up request
    (dominant LIN bus state). The wake-up source can be read on the TXD pin in Fail-safe Mode. A high level indicates a remote
    wake-up request (weak pull up at the TXD pin); a low level indicates a local wake-up request (strong pull down at the TXD
    pin). The wake-up request flag (signalled on the RXD pin), as well as the wake-up source flag (signalled on the TXD pin), is
    immediately reset if the microcontroller sets the EN pin to high (see Figure 4-2 on page 8 and Figure 4-3 on page 9) and the
    IC is in Normal Mode. The last wake-up source flag is stored and signalled in Fail-safe Mode at the TXD pin.
5.5 Fail-safe Features
       ●    During a short-circuit at LIN to VBattery, the output limits the output current to IBUS_lim. Due to the power dissipation, the
            chip temperature exceeds TLINoff, and the LIN output is switched off. The chip cools down and after a hysteresis of
            Thys, switches the output on again. RXD stays on high because LIN is high. During LIN overtemperature switch-off,
            the VCC regulator works independently.
       ●    During a short-circuit from LIN to GND the IC can be switched into Sleep or Silent Mode. If the short-circuit
            disappears, the IC starts with a remote wake-up.
       ●    The reverse current is very low < 2µA at the LIN pin during loss of VBatt. This is optimal behavior for bus systems
            where some slave nodes are supplied from battery or ignition.
       ●    During a short circuit at VCC, the output limits the output current to IVCClim. Because of undervoltage, NRES switches
            to low and sends a reset to the microcontroller. The IC switches into Fail-safe Mode. If the chip temperature exceeds
            the value TVCCoff, the VCC output switches off. The chip cools down and after a hysteresis of Thys, switches the output
            on again. Because of the Fail-safe Mode, the VCC voltage will switch on again although EN is switched off from the
            microcontroller. The microcontroller can start with its normal operation.
       ●    EN pin provides a pull-down resistor to force the transceiver into recessive mode if EN is disconnected.
       ●    RXD pin is set floating if VBatt is disconnected.
       ●    TXD pin provides a pull-up resistor to force the transceiver into recessive mode if TXD is disconnected.

    4986O–AUTO–10/14


       ●    If TXD is short-circuited to GND, it is possible to switch to Sleep Mode via ENABLE after tdom > 20ms (only for Atmel®
            ATA6622C/ATA6624C).
       ●    If the WD_OSC pin has a short-circuit to GND and the NTRIG Signal has a period time > 27ms, the watchdog runs
            with an internal oscillator and guarantees a reset after the second NTRIG signal at the latest.
       ●    If the resistor at WO_OSC pin is disconnected, the watchdog runs with an internal oscillator and guarantees a reseet
            after the second NTRIG signal at the latest.
5.6   Voltage Regulator
      The voltage regulator needs an external capacitor for compensation and for smoothing the disturbances from the
      microcontroller. It is recommended to use an electrolythic capacitor with C > 1.8µF and a ceramic capacitor with C = 100nF.
      The values of these capacitors can be varied by the customer, depending on the application.
      The main power dissipation of the IC is created from the VCC output current IVCC, which is needed for the application. In
      Figure 5-2 on page 13 the safe operating area of the Atmel ATA6624C/ATA6626C is shown.

      For programming purposes of the microcontroller it is potentially necessary to supply the VCC output via an external power
      supply while the VS Pin of the system basis chip is disconnected. This will not affect the system basis chip.

6.  Watchdog
    The watchdog anticipates a trigger signal from the microcontroller at the NTRIG (negative edge) input within a time window
    of Twd. The trigger signal must exceed a minimum time ttrigmin > 200ns. If a triggering signal is not received, a reset signal will
    be generated at output NRES. The timing basis of the watchdog is provided by the internal oscillator. Its time period, Tosc, is
    adjustable via the external resistor Rwd_osc (34kΩ to 120kΩ).
    During Silent or Sleep Mode the watchdog is switched off to reduce current consumption.
    The minimum time for the first watchdog pulse is required after the undervoltage reset at NRES disappears. It is defined as
    lead time td. After wake up from Sleep or Silent Mode, the lead time td starts with the negative edge of the RXD output.
6.1 Typical Timing Sequence with RWD_OSC = 51kΩ
    The trigger signal Twd is adjustable between 20ms and 64ms using the external resistor RWD_OSC.
    For example, with an external resistor of RWD_OSC = 51kΩ ±1%, the typical parameters of the watchdog are as follows:
    tosc = 0.405 × RWD_OSC – 0.0004 × (RWD_OSC)2 (RWD_OSC in kΩ; tosc in µs)
    tOSC = 19.6µs due to 51kΩ
    td = 7895 × 19.6µs = 155ms
    t1 = 1053 × 19.6µs = 20.6ms
    t2 = 1105 × 19.6µs = 21.6ms
    tnres = constant = 4ms
    After ramping up the battery voltage, the 3.3V/5V regulator is switched on. The reset output NRES stays low for the time treset
    (typically 4ms), then it switches to high, and the watchdog waits for the trigger sequence from the microcontroller. The lead
    time, td, follows the reset and is td = 155ms. In this time, the first watchdog pulse from the microcontroller is required. If the
    trigger pulse NTRIG occurs during this time, the time t1 starts immediately. If no trigger signal occurs during the time td, a
    watchdog reset with tNRES = 4ms will reset the microcontroller after td = 155ms. The times t1 and t2 have a fixed relationship
    between each other. A triggering signal from the microcontroller is anticipated within the time frame of t2 = 21.6ms. To avoid
    false triggering from glitches, the trigger pulse must be longer than tTRIG,min > 200ns. This slope serves to restart the
    watchdog sequence. If the triggering signal fails in this open window t2, the NRES output will be drawn to ground. A
    triggering signal during the closed window t1 immediately switches NRES to low.

6.2 Worst Case Calculation with RWD_OSC = 51kΩ
    The internal oscillator has a tolerance of 20%. This means that t1 and t2 can also vary by 20%. The worst case calculation for
    the watchdog period twd is calculated as follows.
    The ideal watchdog time twd is between the maximum t1 and the minimum t1 plus the minimum t2.
    t1,min = 0.8 × t1 = 16.5ms, t1,max = 1.2 × t1 = 24.8ms
    t2,min = 0.8 × t2 = 17.3ms, t2,max = 1.2 × t2 = 26ms
    twdmax = t1min + t2min = 16.5ms + 17.3ms = 33.8ms
    twdmin = t1max = 24.8ms
    twd = 29.3ms ±4.5ms (±15%)
    A microcontroller with an oscillator tolerance of ±15% is sufficient to supply the trigger inputs correctly.
