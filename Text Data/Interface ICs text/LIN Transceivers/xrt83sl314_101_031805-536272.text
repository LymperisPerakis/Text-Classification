PIN DESCRIPTIONS BY FUNCTION
MICROPROCESSOR
     NAME      PIN     TYPE                                      DESCRIPTION
      CS       A22       I    Chip Select Input
                              Active low signal. This signal enables the microprocessor interface by pulling
                              chip select "Low". The microprocessor interface is disabled when the chip
                              select signal returns "High".
   ALE_TS      C19       I    Address Latch Enable Input (Transfer Start)
                              See the Microprocessor section of this datasheet for a description.
   WR_R/W      A20       I    Write Strobe Input (Read/Write)
                              See the Microprocessor section of this datasheet for a description.
   RD_WE       D18       I    Read Strobe Input (Write Enable)
                              See the Microprocessor section of this datasheet for a description.
   RDY_TA      AA3      O     Ready Output (Transfer Acknowledge)
                              See the Microprocessor section of this datasheet for a description.
      INT      B3       O     Interrupt Output
                              Active low signal. This signal is asserted "Low" when a change in alarm status
                              occurs. Once the status registers have been read, the interrupt pin will return
                              "High". GIE (Global Interrupt Enable) must be set "High" in the appropriate
                              global register to enable interrupt generation.
                              NOTE: This pin is internally pulled "High" with a 50KΩ resistor.

 1.0 CLOCK SYNTHESIZER
In system design, fewer clocks on the network card could reduce noise and interference. Common clock
references such as 8kHz are readily available to network designers. Network cards that support both T1 and
E1 modes must be able to produce 1.544MHz and 2.048MHz transmission data. The XRT83SL314 has a built
in clock synthesizer that requires only one input clock reference by programming CLKSEL[3:0] in the
appropriate global register. A list of the input clock options is shown in Table 1.

The single input clock reference is used to generate multiple timing references. The first objective of the clock
synthesizer is to generate 1.544MHz and 2.048MHz for each of the 14 channels. This allows each channel to
operate in either T1 or E1 mode independent from the other channels. The state of the equalizer control bits in
the appropriate channel registers determine whether the LIU operates in T1 or E1 mode. The second objective
is to generate additional output clock references for system use. The available output clock references are
shown in Figure 2.

  1.1    ALL T1/E1 Mode
To reduce system noise and power consumption, the XRT83SL314 offers an ALL T1/E1 mode. Since most
line card designs are configured to operate in T1 or E1 only, the LIU can be selected to shut off the timing
references for the mode not being used by programming the appropriate global register. By default the ALL
T1/E1 mode is enabled (ALLT1/E1 bit = "0"). If the LIU is configured for T1, all E1 clock references and the
8kHz reference are shut off internally to the chip. This reduces the amount of internal clocks switching within
the LIU, hence reducing noise and power consumption. In E1 mode, the T1 clock references are internally
shut off, however the 8kHz reference is available. To disable this feature, the ALLT1/E1 bit must be set to a "1"
in the appropriate global register.
  2.0 RECEIVE PATH LINE INTERFACE
The receive path of the XRT83SL314 LIU consists of 14 independent T1/E1/J1 receivers. The following
section describes the complete receive path from RTIP/RRING inputs to RCLK/RPOS/RNEG outputs. A
simplified block diagram of the receive path is shown in Figure 3.

 2.1     Line Termination (RTIP/RRING)
  2.1.1     CASE 1: Internal Termination
The input stage of the receive path accepts standard T1/E1/J1 twisted pair or E1 coaxial cable inputs through
RTIP and RRING. The physical interface is optimized by placing the terminating impedance inside the LIU.
This allows one bill of materials for all modes of operation reducing the number of external components
necessary in system design. The receive termination (along with the transmit termination) impedance is
selected by programming TERSEL[1:0] to match the line impedance. Selecting the internal impedance is
shown in Table 2.

The XRT83SL314 has the ability to switch the internal termination to "High" impedance by programming
RxTSEL in the appropriate channel register. For internal termination, set RxTSEL to "1". By default, RxTSEL
is set to "0" ("High" impedance). For redundancy applications, a dedicated hardware pin (RxTSEL) is also
available to control the receive termination for all channels simultaneously. This hardware pin takes priority
over the register setting if RxTCNTL is set to "1" in the appropriate global register. If RxTCNTL is set to "0", the
state of this pin is ignored. See Figure 4 for a typical connection diagram using the internal termination.

  2.1.2     CASE 2: Internal Termination With One External Fixed Resistor for All Modes
Along with the internal termination, a high precision external fixed resistor can be used to optimize the return
loss. This external resistor can be used for all modes of operation ensuring one bill of materials. There are
three resistor values that can be used by setting the RxRES[1:0] bits in the appropriate channel register.
Selecting the value for the external fixed resistor is shown in Table 3.

By default, RxRES[1:0] is set to "None" for no external fixed resistor. If an external fixed resistor is used, the
XRT83SL314 uses the parallel combination of the external fixed resistor and the internal termination as the
input impedance. See Figure 5 for a typical connection diagram using the external fixed resistor.
NOTE: Without the external resistor, the XRT83SL314 meets all return loss specifications. This mode was created to add
        flexibility for optimizing return loss by using a high precision external resistor.

 2.2     Equalizer Control
The main objective of the equalizer is to amplify an input attenuated signal to a pre-determined amplitude that
is acceptable to the peak detector circuit. Using feedback from the peak detector, the equalizer will gain the
input up to the maximum value specified by the equalizer control bits, in the appropriate channel register,
normalizing the signal. Once the signal has reached the pre-determined amplitude, the signal is then
processed within the peak detector and slicer circuit. A simplified block diagram of the equalizer and peak
detector is shown in Figure 6.

 2.3     Cable Loss Indicator
The ability to monitor the cable loss attenuation of the receiver inputs is a valuable feature. The XRT83SL314
contains a per channel, read only register for cable loss indication. CLOS[5:0] is a 6-Bit binary word that
reports the value of cable loss in 1dB steps. An example of -15dB cable loss attenuation is shown in Figure 7.

 2.4     Equalizer Attenuation Flag
The ability to detect the amount of cable loss on the receiver inputs is enhanced by having the ability to
generate an interrupt by programming a pre-determined value for cable loss into the EQFLAG[5:0] global
register. This is particularly useful in applications where it is necessary for the LIU to generate an interrupt for
a cable loss which is lower than the declaration of the RLOS feature (see the RLOS section in this datasheet).
If the contents of the EQFLAG[5:0] register bits are equal to or less than the contents in the cable loss indicator
bits CLOS[5:0] for a given channel, an interrupt will be generated (if enabled in the appropriate channel register
and GIE is to "1"). Using the same example in Figure 7, a simplified block diagram of the equalizer flag is
shown in Figure 8.

 2.5     Peak Detector and Slicer
The peak detector provides feedback to the equalizer control circuit until the amplitude of the incoming signal is
at an appropriate level. Once this level is obtained, the slicer identifies the incoming signal as a "1" and passes
the raw data to the clock and data recovery circuit. The slicer threshold is selected by programming SL[1:0] in
the appropriate global register. Selecting the slicer level is shown in Table 4.

 2.6    Clock and Data Recovery
The receive clock (RCLK) is recovered by the clock and data recovery circuitry. An internal PLL locks on the
incoming data stream and outputs a clock that’s in phase with the incoming signal. This allows for multi-
channel T1/E1/J1 signals to arrive from different timing sources and remain independent. In the absence of an
incoming signal, RCLK maintains its timing by using the internal master clock as its reference. The recovered
data can be updated on either edge of RCLK. By default, data is updated on the rising edge of RCLK. To
update data on the falling edge of RCLK, set RCLKE to "1" in the appropriate global register. Figure 9 is a
timing diagram of the receive data updated on the rising edge of RCLK. Figure 10 is a timing diagram of the
receive data updated on the falling edge of RCLK. The timing specifications are shown in Table 5.

 2.6.1      Receive Sensitivity
To meet short haul requirements, the XRT83SL314 can accept T1/E1/J1 signals that have been attenuated by
12dB of flat loss in E1 mode or by 655 feet of cable loss along with 6dB of flat loss in T1 mode. However, the
XRT83SL314 can tolerate cable loss and flat loss beyond the industry specifications. The receive sensitivity in
the short haul mode is approximately 4,000 feet without experiencing bit errors, LOF, pattern synchronization,
etc. Although data integrity is maintained, the RLOS function (if enabled) will report an RLOS condition
according to the receiver loss of signal section in this datasheet. The test configuration for measuring the
receive sensitivity is shown in Figure 11.

  2.6.3    General Alarm Detection and Interrupt Generation
The receive path detects EQFLAG, RLOS, AIS, QRPD, NCLD, and FLS. These alarms can be individually
masked to prevent the alarm from triggering an interrupt. To enable interrupt generation, the Global Interrupt
Enable (GIE) bit must be set "High" in the appropriate global register. Any time a change in status occurs (it
the alarms are enabled), the interrupt pin will pull "Low" to indicate an alarm has occurred. Once the status
registers have been read, the INT pin will return "High". The status registers are Reset Upon Read (RUR).
The interrupts are categorized in a hierarchical process block. Figure 13 is a simplified block diagram of the
interrupt generation process.

In T1 mode, RLOS is declared if an incoming signal has no transitions over a period of 175 +/-75 contiguous
pulse intervals. However, the XRT83SL314 LIU has a built in analog RLOS so that the user can be notified
when the amplitude of the incoming signal has been attenuated -9dB below the equalizer gain setting. For
example: In T1 or E1 short haul mode, the equalizer gain setting is 15dB. Once the input reaches an
amplitude of -24dB below nominal, the LIU will declare RLOS. The RLOS circuitry clears when the input
reaches +3dB relative to where it was declared. This +3dB value is a pre-determined hysteresis so that
transients will not cause the RLOS to clear. In E1 mode, RLOS is declared if an incoming signal has no
transitions for N consecutive pulse intervals, where 10≤N≤255. According to G.775, no transitions in E1 mode
is defined between -9dB and -35dB below nominal. Figure 14 is a simplified block diagram of the analog
RLOS function. Table 6 summarizes the analog RLOS values for the different equalizer gain settings.

  2.6.3.2        EXLOS (Extended Loss of Signal)
By enabling the extended loss of signal by programming the appropriate channel register, the digital RLOS is
extended to count 4,096 consecutive zeros before declaring RLOS in T1 and E1 mode. By default, EXLOS is
disabled and RLOS operates in normal mode.
  2.6.3.3        AIS (Alarm Indication Signal)
The XRT83SL314 adheres to the ITU-T G.775 specification for an all ones pattern. The alarm indication signal
is set to "1" if an all ones pattern (at least 99.9% ones density) is present for T, where T is 3ms to 75ms in T1
mode. AIS will clear when the ones density is not met within the same time period T. In E1 mode, the AIS is
set to "1" if the incoming signal has 2 or less zeros in a 512-bit window. AIS will clear when the incoming signal
has 3 or more zeros in the 512-bit window.

  2.6.3.4     NLCD (Network Loop Code Detection)
The Network Loop Code Detection can be programmed to detect a Loop-Up, Loop-Down, or Automatic Loop
Code. If the network loop code detection is programmed for Loop-Up, the NLCD will be set "High" if a
repeating pattern of "00001" occurs for more than 5 seconds. If the network loop code detection is
programmed for Loop-Down, the NLCD will be set "High" if a repeating pattern of "001" occurs for more than 5
seconds. If the network loop code detection is programmed for automatic loop code, the LIU is configured to
detect a Loop-Up code. If a Loop-Up code is detected for more than 5 seconds, the XRT83SL314 will
automatically program the channel into a remote loopback mode. The LIU will remain in remote loopback even
if the Loop-Up code disappears. The channel will continue in remote loop back until a Loop-Down code is
detected for more than 5 seconds (or, if the automatic loop code is disabled) and then automatically return to
normal operation with no loop back. The process of the automatic loop code detection is shown in Figure 15.

  2.6.3.5       FLSD (FIFO Limit Status Detection)
The purpose of the FIFO limit status is to indicate when the Read and Write FIFO pointers are within a pre-
determined range (over-flow or under-flow indication). The FLSD is set to "1" if the FIFO Read and Write
Pointers are within ±3-Bits.
  2.6.3.6       LCVD (Line Code Violation Detection)
The LIU contains 14 independent, 16-bit LCV counters. When the counters reach full-scale, they remain
saturated at FFFFh until they are reset globally or on a per channel basis. For performance monitoring, the
counters can be updated globally or on a per channel basis to place the contents of the counters into holding
registers. The LIU uses an indirect address bus to access a counter for a given channel. Once the contents of
the counters have been placed in holding registers, they can be individually read out from register 0xE8h 8-bits
at a time according to the BYTEsel bit in the appropriate global register. By default, the LSB is in register
0xE8h until the BYTEsel is pulled "High" where upon the MSB will be placed in the register for read back.
Once both bytes have been read, the next channel may be selected for read back.
By default, the LVC/OFD will be set to a "1" if the receiver is currently detecting line code violations or
excessive zeros for HDB3 (E1 mode) or B8ZS (T1 mode). In AMI mode, the LCVD will be set to a "1" if the
receiver is currently detecting bipolar violations or excessive zeros. However, if the LIU is configured to
monitor the 16-bit LCV counter by programming the appropriate global register, the LCV/OFD will be set to a
"1" if the counter saturates.
 2.7      Receive Jitter Attenuator
The receive path has a dedicated jitter attenuator that reduces phase and frequency jitter in the recovered
clock. The jitter attenuator uses a data FIFO (First In First Out) with a programmable depth of 32-bit or 64-bit.
If the LIU is used for line synchronization (loop timing systems), the JA should be enabled. When the Read
and Write pointers of the FIFO are within 2-Bits of over-flowing or under-flowing, the bandwidth of the jitter
attenuator is widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. When this condition
occurs, the jitter attenuator will not attenuate input jitter until the Read/Write pointer’s position is outside the 2-
Bit window. In T1 mode, the bandwidth of the JA is always set to 3Hz. In E1 mode, the bandwidth is
programmable to either 10Hz or 1.5Hz (1.5Hz automatically selects the 64-Bit FIFO depth). The JA has a
clock delay equal to ½ of the FIFO bit depth.
NOTE: If the LIU is used in a multiplexer/mapper application where stuffing bits are typically removed, the transmit path has
         a dedicated jitter attenuator to smooth out the gapped clock. See the Transmit Section of this datasheet.
 2.8      HDB3/B8ZS Decoder
In single rail mode, RPOS can decode AMI or HDB3/B8ZS signals. For E1 mode, HDB3 is defined as any
block of 4 successive zeros replaced with OOOV or BOOV, so that two successive V pulses are of opposite
polarity to prevent a DC component. In T1 mode, 8 successive zeros are replaced with OOOVBOVB. If the
HDB3/B8ZS decoder is selected, the receive path removes the V and B pulses so that the original data is
output to RPOS.

 2.10    RxMUTE (Receiver LOS with Data Muting)
The receive muting function can be selected by setting RxMUTE to "1" in the appropriate global register. If
selected, any channel that experiences an RLOS condition will automatically pull RPOS and RNEG "Low" to
prevent data chattering. If RLOS does not occur, the RxMUTE will remain inactive until an RLOS on a given
channel occurs. The default setting for RxMUTE is "0" which is disabled. A simplified block diagram of the
RxMUTE function is shown in Figure 18.

This applications section describes common T1/E1 system considerations along with references to application
notes available for reference where applicable.
 3.1     Loopback Diagnostics
The XRT83SL314 supports several loopback modes for diagnostic testing. The following section describes the
local analog loopback, remote loopback, digital loopback, and dual loopback modes.
  3.1.1    Local Analog Loopback
With local analog loopback activated, the transmit output data at TTIP/TRING is internally looped back to the
analog inputs at RTIP/RRING. External inputs at RTIP/RRING are ignored while valid transmit output data
continues to be sent to the line. A simplified block diagram of local analog loopback is shown in Figure 19.

 3.2     84-Channel T1/E1 Multiplexer/Mapper Applications
The XRT83SL314 has the capability of providing the necessary chip selects for multiple 14-channel LIU
devices. The LIU is responsible for selecting itself, up to 5 additional LIU devices, or all 6 devices
simultaneously for permitting access to internal registers. The state of the chip select output pins is
determined by a chip select decoder controlled by the 3 MSBs of the address bus ADDR[10:8]. Only one LIU
(Master) requires the ADDR[10:8]. The other 5 LIU devices use the 8 LSBs for the direct address bus
ADDR[7:0]. Figure 23 is a simplified block diagram of connecting six 14-channel LIU devices for 84-channel
applications. Selection of the chip select outputs using ADDR[10:8] is shown in Table 7.

 3.3     Line Card Redundancy
Telecommunication system design requires signal integrity and reliability. When a T1/E1 primary line card has
a failure, it must be swapped with a backup line card while maintaining connectivity to a backplane without
losing data. System designers can achieve this by implementing common redundancy schemes with the
XRT83SL314 LIU. EXAR offers features that are tailored to redundancy applications while reducing the
number of components and providing system designers with solid reference designs.
RLOS and DMO
If an RLOS or DMO condition occurs, the XRT83SL314 reports the alarm to the individual status registers on a
per channel basis. However, for redundancy applications, an RLOS or DMO alarm can be used to initiate an
automatic switch to the back up card. For this application, two global pins RLOS and DMO are used to indicate
that one of the 14-channels has an RLOS or DMO condition.
Typical Redundancy Schemes
• 1:1 One backup card for every primary card (Facility Protection)
• 1+1 One backup card for every primary card (Line Protection)
• ·N+1 One backup card for N primary cards
  3.3.1     1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy Without Relays
The 1:1 facility protection and 1+1 line protection have one backup card for every primary card. When using
1:1 or 1+1 redundancy, the backup card has its transmitters tri-stated and its receivers in high impedance. This
eliminates the need for external relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation.
For 1+1 line protection, the receiver inputs on the backup card have the ability to monitor the line for bit errors
while in high impedance. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.
  3.3.2     Transmit Interface with 1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy
The transmitters on the backup card should be tri-stated. Select the appropriate impedance for the desired
mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for blocking DC bias. See
Figure 24. for a simplified block diagram of the transmit section for a 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy.

  3.3.3     Receive Interface with 1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy
The receivers on the backup card should be programmed for "High" impedance. Since there is no external
resistor in the circuit, the receivers on the backup card will not load down the line interface. This key design
feature eliminates the need for relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation.
Select the impedance for the desired mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. To swap the primary card, set the backup
card to internal impedance, then the primary card to "High" impedance. See Figure 25. for a simplified block
diagram of the receive section for a 1:1 redundancy scheme.

  3.3.4    N+1 Redundancy Using External Relays
N+1 redundancy has one backup card for N primary cards. Due to impedance mismatch and signal
contention, external relays are necessary when using this redundancy scheme. The relays create complete
isolation between the primary cards and the backup card. This allows all transmitters and receivers on the
primary cards to be configured in internal impedance, providing one bill of materials for all interface modes of
operation. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.
                                                                    31

  3.3.5    Transmit Interface with N+1 Redundancy
For N+1 redundancy, the transmitters on all cards should be programmed for internal impedance. The
transmitters on the backup card do not have to be tri-stated. To swap the primary card, close the desired
relays, and tri-state the transmitters on the failed primary card. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP

 3.3.6     Receive Interface with N+1 Redundancy
For N+1 redundancy, the receivers on the primary cards should be programmed for internal impedance. The
receivers on the backup card should be programmed for "High" impedance mode. To swap the primary card,
set the backup card to internal impedance, then the primary card to "High" impedance. See Figure 27 for a
simplified block diagram of the receive section for a N+1 redundancy scheme.

 3.4     Power Failure Protection
For 1:1 or 1+1 line card redundancy in T1/E1 applications, power failure could cause a line card to change the
characteristics of the line impedance, causing a degradation in system performance. The XRT83SL314 was
designed to ensure reliability during power failures. The LIU has patented high impedance circuits that allow
the receiver inputs and the transmitter outputs to be in "High" impedance when the LIU experiences a power
failure or when the LIU is powered off.
NOTE: For power failure protection, a transformer must be used to couple to the line interface. See the TAN-56 application
        note for more details.
 3.5     Overvoltage and Overcurrent Protection
Physical layer devices such as LIUs that interface to telecommunications lines are exposed to overvoltage
transients posed by environmental threats. An Overvoltage transient is a pulse of energy concentrated over a
small period of time, usually under a few milliseconds. These pulses are random and exceed the operating
conditions of CMOS transceiver ICs. Electronic equipment connecting to data lines are susceptible to many
forms of overvoltage transients such as lightning, AC power faults and electrostatic discharge (ESD). There
are three important standards when designing a telecommunications system to withstand overvoltage
transients.
• UL1950 and FCC Part 68
• Telcordia (Bellcore) GR-1089
• ITU-T K.20, K.21 and K.41
NOTE: For a reference design and performance, see the TAN-54 application note for more details.
 3.6     Non-Intrusive Monitoring
In non-intrusive monitoring applications, the transmitters are shut off by setting TxON "Low". The receivers
must be actively receiving data without interfering with the line impedance. The XRT83SL314’s internal
termination ensures that the line termination meets T1/E1 specifications for 75Ω, 100Ω or 120Ω while
monitoring the data stream. System integrity is maintained by placing the non-intrusive receiver in "High"
impedance, equivalent to that of a 1+1 redundancy application. A simplified block diagram of non-intrusive
monitoring is shown in Figure 28.

 4.0 TRANSMIT PATH LINE INTERFACE
The transmit path of the XRT83SL314 LIU consists of 14 independent T1/E1/J1 transmitters. The following
section describes the complete transmit path from TCLK/TPOS/TNEG inputs to TTIP/TRING outputs. A
simplified block diagram of the transmit path is shown in Figure 29.

 4.1     TCLK/TPOS/TNEG Digital Inputs
In dual rail mode, TPOS and TNEG are the digital inputs for the transmit path. In single rail mode, TNEG has
no function and can be left unconnected. The XRT83SL314 can be programmed to sample the inputs on
either edge of TCLK. By default, data is sampled on the falling edge of TCLK. To sample data on the rising
edge of TCLK, set TCLKE to "1" in the appropriate global register. Figure 30 is a timing diagram of the transmit
input data sampled on the falling edge of TCLK. Figure 31 is a timing diagram of the transmit input data
sampled on the rising edge of TCLK. The timing specifications are shown in Table 8.

 4.2     HDB3/B8ZS Encoder
In single rail mode, the LIU can encode the TPOS input signal to AMI or HDB3/B8ZS data. In E1 mode and
HDB3 encoding selected, any sequence with four or more consecutive zeros in the input will be replaced with
000V or B00V, where "B" indicates a pulse conforming to the bipolar rule and "V" representing a pulse violating
the rule. An example of HDB3 encoding is shown in Table 9. In T1 mode and B8ZS encoding selected, an
input data sequence with eight or more consecutive zeros will be replaced using the B8ZS encoding rule. An
example with Bipolar with 8 Zero Substitution is shown in Table 10.

 4.3     Transmit Jitter Attenuator
The XRT83SL314 LIU is ideal for multiplexer or mapper applications where the network data crosses multiple
timing domains. As the higher data rates are de-multiplexed down to T1 or E1 data, stuffing bits are typically
removed which can leave gaps in the incoming data stream. The transmit path has a dedicated jitter
attenuator with a 32-Bit or 64-Bit FIFO that is used to smooth the gapped clock into a steady T1 or E1 output.
The maximum gap width of the 14-Channel LIU is shown in Table 11.

NOTE: If the LIU is used in a loop timing system, the receive path has a dedicated jitter attenuator. See the Receive
        Section of this datasheet.
 4.4     TAOS (Transmit All Ones)
The XRT83SL314 has the ability to transmit all ones on a per channel basis by programming the appropriate
channel register. This function takes priority over the digital data present on the TPOS/TNEG inputs. For
example: If a fixed "0011" pattern is present on TPOS in single rail mode and TAOS is enabled, the transmitter
will output all ones. In addition, if digital or dual loopback is selected, the data on the RPOS output will be
equal to the data on the TPOS input. Figure 32 is a diagram showing the all ones signal at TTIP and TRING.

 4.5     Transmit Diagnostic Features
In addition to TAOS, the XRT83SL314 offers multiple diagnostic features for analyzing network integrity such
as ATAOS, Network Loop Code generation, and QRSS on a per channel basis by programming the
appropriate registers. These diagnostic features take priority over the digital data present on TPOS/TNEG
inputs. The transmitters will send the diagnostic code to the line and will be maintained in the digital loopback
if selected. When the LIU is responsible for sending diagnostic patterns, the LIU is automatically placed in the
single rail mode.

  4.5.1    ATAOS (Automatic Transmit All Ones)
If ATAOS is selected by programming the appropriate global register, an AMI all ones signal will be transmitted
for each channel that experiences an RLOS condition. If RLOS does not occur, the ATAOS will remain inactive
until an RLOS on a given channel occurs. A simplified block diagram of the ATAOS function is shown in
Figure 33.

If TCLK is not present, pulled "Low", or pulled "High" the transmitter outputs at TTIP/TRING will automatically
send an all ones or an all zero signal to the line by programming the appropriate global register. By default, the
transmitters will send all zeros. To send all ones, the TCLKCNL bit must be set "High".

  4.6.1      T1 Short Haul Line Build Out (LBO)
The short haul transmitter output pulses are generated using a 7-Bit internal DAC (6-Bit plus the MSB sign bit).
The line build out can be set to interface to five different ranges of cable attenuation by programming the
appropriate channel register. The pulse shape is divided into eight discrete time segments which are set to
fixed values to comply with the pulse template. To program the eight segments individually to optimize a
special line build out, see the arbitrary pulse section of this datasheet. The short haul LBO settings are shown
in Table 13.

  4.6.2      Arbitrary Pulse Generator For T1 and E1
The arbitrary pulse generator divides the pulse into eight individual segments. Each segment is set by a 7-Bit
binary word by programming the appropriate channel register. This allows the system designer to set the
overshoot, amplitude, and undershoot for a unique line build out. The MSB (bit 7) is a sign-bit. If the sign-bit is
set to "0", the segment will move in a positive direction relative to a flat line (zero) condition. If this sign-bit is
set to "1", the segment will move in a negative direction relative to a flat line condition. The resolution of the
DAC is typically 60mV per LSB. Thus, writing 7-bit = 1111111 will clamp the output at either voltage rail
corresponding to a maximum amplitude. A pulse with numbered segments is shown in Figure 36.

NOTE: By default, the arbitrary segments are programmed to 0x00h. The transmitter outputs will result in an all zero
         pattern to the line interface.
 4.7      DMO (Digital Monitor Output)
The driver monitor circuit is used to detect transmit driver failures by monitoring the activities at TTIP/TRING
outputs. Driver failure may be caused by a short circuit in the primary transformer or system problems at the
transmit inputs. If the transmitter of a channel has no output for more than 128 clock cycles, DMO goes "High"
until a valid transmit pulse is detected. If the DMO interrupt is enabled, the change in status of DMO will cause

the interrupt pin to go "Low". Once the status register is read, the interrupt pin will return "High" and the status
register will be reset (RUR).
 4.8     Line Termination (TTIP/TRING)
The output stage of the transmit path generates standard return-to-zero (RZ) signals to the line interface for T1/
E1/J1 twisted pair or E1 coaxial cable. The physical interface is optimized by placing the terminating
impedance inside the LIU. This allows one bill of materials for all modes of operation reducing the number of
external components necessary in system design. The transmitter outputs only require one DC blocking
capacitor of 0.68µF. For redundancy applications (or simply to tri-state the transmitters), set TxTSEL to a "1" in
the appropriate channel register. A typical transmit interface is shown in Figure 37.

The Microprocessor Interface section supports communication between the local microprocessor (µP) and the
LIU. The XRT83SL314 supports an Intel asynchronous interface, Motorola 68K asynchronous, and a Motorola
Power PC interface. The microprocessor interface is selected by the state of the µPTS[2:0] input pins.
Selecting the microprocessor interface is shown in Table 14.

The XRT83SL314 uses multipurpose pins to configure the device appropriately. The local µP configures the
LIU by writing data into specific addressable, on-chip Read/Write registers. The microprocessor interface
provides the signals which are required for a general purpose microprocessor to read or write data into these
registers. The microprocessor interface also supports polled and interrupt driven environments. A simplified
block diagram of the microprocessor is shown in Figure 38.

 5.1      The Microprocessor Interface Block Signals
The LIU may be configured into different operating modes and have its performance monitored by software
through a standard microprocessor using data, address and control signals. These interface signals are
described below in Table 15, Table 16, and Table 17. The microprocessor interface can be configured to
operate in Intel mode or Motorola mode. When the microprocessor interface is operating in Intel mode, some
of the control signals function in a manner required by the Intel 80xx family of microprocessors. Likewise, when
the microprocessor interface is operating in Motorola mode, then these control signals function in a manner as
required by the Motorola Power PC family of microprocessors. (For using a Motorola 68K asynchronous
processor, see Figure 41 and Table 20) Table 15 lists and describes those microprocessor interface signals
whose role is constant across the two modes. Table 16 describes the role of some of these signals when the
microprocessor interface is operating in the Intel mode. Likewise, Table 17 describes the role of these signals
when the microprocessor interface is operating in the Motorola Power PC mode.

 5.2      Intel Mode Programmed I/O Access (Asynchronous)
If the LIU is interfaced to an Intel type µP, then it should be configured to operate in the Intel mode. Intel type
Read and Write operations are described below.
Intel Mode Read Cycle
Whenever an Intel-type µP wishes to read the contents of a register, it should do the following.
 1. Place the address of the target register on the address bus input pins ADDR[10:0].
 2. While the µP is placing this address value on the address bus, the address decoding circuitry should
     assert the CS pin of the LIU, by toggling it "Low". This action enables further communication between the
     µP and the LIU microprocessor interface block.
 3. Toggle the ALE input pin "High". This step enables the address bus input drivers, within the microproces-
     sor interface block of the LIU.
 4. The µP should then toggle the ALE pin "Low". This step causes the LIU to latch the contents of the address
     bus into its internal circuitry. At this point, the address of the register has now been selected.
 5. Next, the µP should indicate that this current bus cycle is a Read operation by toggling the RD input pin
     "Low". This action also enables the bi-directional data bus output drivers of the LIU.
 6. After the µP toggles the Read signal "Low", the LIU will toggle the RDY output pin "Low". The LIU does this
     in order to inform the µP that the data is available to be read by the µP, and that it is ready for the next com-
     mand.
 7. After the µP detects the RDY signal and has read the data, it can terminate the Read Cycle by toggling the
     RD input pin "High".
NOTE: ALE can be tied “High” if this signal is not available.
The Intel Mode Write Cycle
Whenever an Intel type µP wishes to write a byte or word of data into a register within the LIU, it should do the
following.
 1. Place the address of the target register on the address bus input pins ADDR[10:0].
 2. While the µP is placing this address value on the address bus, the address decoding circuitry should
     assert the CS pin of the LIU, by toggling it "Low". This action enables further communication between the
     µP and the LIU microprocessor interface block.
 3. Toggle the ALE input pin "High". This step enables the address bus input drivers, within the microproces-
     sor interface block of the LIU.
 4. The µP should then toggle the ALE pin "Low". This step causes the LIU to latch the contents of the address
     bus into its internal circuitry. At this point, the address of the register has now been selected.
 5. The µP should then place the byte or word that it intends to write into the target register, on the bi-direc-
     tional data bus DATA[7:0].
 6. Next, the µP should indicate that this current bus cycle is a Write operation by toggling the WR input pin
     "Low". This action also enables the bi-directional data bus input drivers of the LIU.
 7. After the µP toggles the Write signal "Low", the LIU will toggle the RDY output pin "Low". The LIU does this
     in order to inform the µP that the data has been written into the internal register location, and that it is ready
     for the next command.
NOTE: ALE can be tied “High” if this signal is not available.

Table 18.

CLOCK SELECT REGISTER
The input clock source is used to generate all the necessary clock references internally to the LIU. The
microprocessor timing is derived from a PLL output which is chosen by programming the Clock Select Bits in
register 0xE9h. Therefore, if the clock selection bits are being programmed, the frequency of the PLL output
will be adjusted accordingly. During this adjustment, it is important to "Not" write to any other bit location within
the same register while selecting the input/output clock frequency. For best results, register 0xE9h can be
broken down into two sub-registers with the MSB being bits D[7:4] and the LSB being bits D[3:0] as shown in
Figure 42. Note: Bits D[7:6] are reserved.

Programming Examples:
Example 1: Changing bits D[7:4]
If bits D[7:4] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the microprocessor
only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 2: Changing bits D[3:0]
If bits D[3:0] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the microprocessor
only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 3: Changing bits within the MSB and LSB
In this scenario, one must initiate TWO write operations such that the MSB and LSB do not change within ONE
write cycle. It is recommended that the MSB and LSB be treated as two independent sub-registers. One can
either change the clock selection (LSB) and then change bits D[5:4] (MSB) on the SECOND write, or vice-
versa. No order or sequence is necessary.
