3.  Functional Description
3.1 Physical Layer Compatibility
    Since the LIN physical layer is independent from higher LIN layers (e.g., the LIN protocol layer), all nodes with a LIN physical
    layer according to revision 2.x can be mixed with LIN physical layer nodes, which, according to older versions (i.e., LIN 1.0,
    LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3), are without any restrictions.
3.2 Supply Pin (VS)
    Undervoltage detection is implemented to disable transmission if VS falls to a value below 5V in order to avoid false bus
    messages. After switching on VS, the IC switches to Fail-safe Mode and INHIBIT is switched on. The supply current in Sleep
    Mode is typically 10µA.
3.3 Ground Pin (GND)
    The Atmel® ATA6662C does not affect the LIN Bus in the case of a GND disconnection. It is able to handle a ground shift up
    to 11.5% of VS.
3.4 Bus Pin (LIN)
    A low-side driver with internal current limitation and thermal shutdown and an internal pull-up resistor are implemented as
    specified for LIN 2.x. The voltage range is from –27V to +40V. This pin exhibits no reverse current from the LIN bus to VS,
    even in the case of a GND shift or VBatt disconnection. The LIN receiver thresholds are compatible to the LIN protocol
    specification.The fall time (from recessive to dominant) and the rise time (from dominant to recessive) are slope controlled.
    The output has a self-adapting short circuit limitation; that is, during current limitation, as the chip temperature increases, the
    current is reduced.
3.5 Input/Output Pin (TXD)
    In Normal Mode the TXD pin is the microcontroller interface to control the state of the Lin output. TXD must be at Low- level
    in order to have a low LIN Bus. If TXD is high, the LIN output transistor is turned off and the Bus is in recessive state. The
    TXD pin is compatible to both a 3.3V or 5V supply. During fail-safe Mode, this pin is used as output and is signalling the
    wake-up source (see Section 3.14 “Wake-up Source Recognition” on page 7). It is current limited to < 8mA.
3.6 TXD Dominant Time-out Function
    The TXD input has an internal pull-down resistor. An internal timer prevents the bus line from being driven permanently in
    dominant state. If TXD is forced to low longer than tDOM > 6ms, the pin LIN will be switched off (Recessive Mode). To reset
    this mode, switch TXD to high (> 10µs) before switching LIN to dominant again.
3.7 Output Pin (RXD)
    This pin reports to the microcontroller the state of the LIN bus. LIN high (recessive) is reported by a high level at RXD, LIN
    low (dominant) is reported by a low voltage at RXD. The output is an open drain, therefore, it is compatible to a 3.3V or 5V
    power supply. The AC characteristics are defined with a pull-up resistor of 5k to 5V and a load capacitor of 20pF. The
    output is short-protected. In Unpowered Mode (VS = 0V), RXD is switched off. For ESD protection a Zener diode is
    integrated, with VZ = 6.1V.
3.8 Enable Input Pin (EN)
    This pin controls the Operation Mode of the interface. If EN = 1, the interface is in Normal Mode, with the transmission path
    from TXD to LIN and from LIN to RXD both active. At a falling edge on EN, while TXD is already set to high, the device is
    switched to Sleep Mode and no transmission is possible. In Sleep Mode, the LIN bus pin is connected to VS with a weak pull-
    up current source. The device can transmit only after being woken up (see Section 3.9 “Inhibit Output Pin (INH)” on page 5).
    During Sleep Mode the device is still supplied from the battery voltage. The supply current is typically 10µA. The pin EN
    provides a pull-down resistor in order to force the transceiver into Sleep Mode in case the pin is disconnected.

    4916S–AUTO–09/14


3.9  Inhibit Output Pin (INH)
     This pin is used to control an external switchable voltage regulator having a wake-up input. The inhibit pin provides an
     internal switch towards pin VS. If the device is in Normal Mode, the inhibit high-side switch is turned on and the external
     voltage regulator is activated. When the device is in Sleep Mode, the inhibit switch is turned off and disables the voltage
     regulator.
     A wake-up event on the LIN bus or at pin WAKE will switch the INH pin to the VS level. After a system power-up (VS rises
     from zero), the pin INH switches automatically to the VS level.
3.10 Wake-up Input Pin (WAKE)
     This pin is a high-voltage input used to wake the device up from Sleep Mode. It is usually connected to an external switch in
     the application to generate a local wake-up. A pull-up current source with typically –10µA is implemented. The voltage
     threshold for a wake-up signal is 3V below the VS voltage with an output current of typically –3µA.
     If you do not need a local wake-up in your application, connect pin WAKE directly to pin VS.
3.11 Operation Modes
        1.   Normal Mode
             This is the normal transmitting and Receiving Mode. All features are available.
        2.   Sleep Mode
             In this mode the transmission path is disabled and the device is in low power mode. Supply current from VBatt is
             typically 10µA. A wake-up signal from the LIN bus or via pin WAKE will be detected and will switch the device to
             Fail-safe Mode. If EN then switches to high, Normal Mode is activated. Input debounce timers at pin WAKE
             (tWAKE), LIN (tBUS) and EN (tsleep,tnom) prevent unwanted wake-up events due to automotive transients or EMI. In
             Sleep Mode the INH pin is left floating. The internal termination between pin LIN and pin VS is disabled. Only a
             weak pull-up current (typical 10µA) between pin LIN and pin VS is present. The Sleep Mode can be activated inde-
             pendently from the actual level on pin LIN or WAKE.
        3.   Fail-safe Mode
             At system power-up or after a wake-up event, the device automatically switches to Fail- safe Mode. It switches the
             INH pin to a high state, to the VS level. LIN communication is switched off. The microcontroller of the application
             will then confirm the Normal Mode by setting the EN pin to high.
        4.   Unpowered Mode
             If you connect battery voltage to the application circuit, the voltage at the VS pin increases according to the block
             capacitor. After VS is higher than the VS undervoltage threshold VSth, the IC mode changes from Unpowered
             Mode to Fail-safe Mode. Then the LIN driver is switched off, but the LIN receiver is active, if the TXD pin is at low
             level.

3.12 Remote Wake-up via Dominant Bus State
     A voltage less than the LIN pre-wake detection VLINL at pin LIN activates the internal LIN receiver and switches on the
     internal slave termination between the LIN pin and the VS pin.
     A falling edge at pin LIN, followed by a dominant bus level VBUSdom maintained for a certain time period (tBUS) and a rising
     edge at pin LIN results in a remote wake-up request. The device switches to Fail-safe Mode. Pin INH is activated (switches
     to VS) and the internal termination resistor is switched on. The remote wake-up request is indicated by a low level at pin RXD
     to interrupt the microcontroller (see Figure 3-2 on page 6).

3.13 Local Wake-up via Pin WAKE
     A falling edge at pin WAKE, followed by a low level maintained for a certain time period (tWAKE), results in a local wake-up
     request. The wake-up time (tWAKE) ensures that no transient, according to ISO7637, creates a wake-up. The device switches
     to Fail-safe Mode. Pin INH is activated (switches to VS) and the internal termination resistor is switched on. The local wake-
     up request is indicated by a low level at pin RXD to interrupt the microcontroller and a strong pull-down at pin TXD (see
     Figure 3-3). The voltage threshold for a wake-up signal is 3V below the VS voltage with an output current of typical –3µA.
     Even in the case of a continuous low at pin WAKE it is possible to switch the IC into Sleep Mode via a low at pin EN. The IC
     will stay in Sleep Mode for an unlimited time. To generate a new wake up at pin WAKE it needs first a high signal > 6µs
     before a negative edge starts the wake-up filtering time again.

3.14 Wake-up Source Recognition
     The device can distinguish between a local wake-up request (pin WAKE) and a remote wake-up request (LIN bus). The
     wake-up source can be read on pin TXD in Fail-safe Mode. If an external pull-up resistor (typically 5k) has been added on
     pin TXD to the power supply of the microcontroller, a high level indicates a remote wake-up request (weak pull-down at pin
     TXD) and a low level indicates a local wake-up request (strong pull-down at pin TXD).
     The wake-up request flag (signalled on pin RXD) as well as the wake-up source flag (signalled on pin TXD) are reset
     immediately if the microcontroller sets pin EN to high (see Figure 3-2 on page 6 and Figure 3-3).
                                                                                                ATA6662C [DATASHEET]              7

3.15 Fail-safe Features
       ●    The reverse current is < 2µA at pin LIN during loss of VBAT; this is optimal behavior for bus systems where some slave
            nodes are supplied from battery or ignition.
       ●    Pin EN provides a pull-down resistor to force the transceiver into Sleep Mode if EN is disconnected.
       ●    Pin RXD is set floating if VBAT is disconnected.
       ●    Pin TXD provides a pull-down resistor to provide a static low if TXD is disconnected.
       ●    The LIN output driver has a current limitation, and if the junction temperature Tj exceeds the thermal shut-down
            temperature Toff, the output driver switches off.
       ●    The implemented hysteresis, Thys, enables the LIN output again after the temperature has been decreased.
