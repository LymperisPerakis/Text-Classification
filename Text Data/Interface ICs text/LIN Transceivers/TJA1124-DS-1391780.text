                Rev. 1 — 8 May 2018                                                Product data sheet
1 General description
             The TJA1124 is a quad Local Interconnect Network (LIN) master channel device.
             It provides the interface between a LIN master protocol controller and the physical
             bus in a LIN network. Each of the four channels contains a LIN transceiver and LIN
             master termination. The TJA1124 is primarily intended for in-vehicle subnetworks using
             baud rates up to 20 kBd and is compliant with LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A,
             ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V LIN) and SAE J2602-1.
             The transmit data streams generated by the LIN master protocol controller are converted
             by the TJA1124 into optimized bus signals shaped to minimize ElectroMagnetic Emission
             (EME). The LIN bus output pins are pulled HIGH via internal LIN master termination
             resistors. The receivers detect receive data streams on the LIN bus input pins and
             transfer them to the microcontroller via pins RXD1 to RXD4.
             Power consumption is very low in Low Power mode. However, the TJA1124 can still be
             woken up via pins SLP and LIN1 to LIN4.

6       Functional description
                       The TJA1124 is the interface between the LIN master protocol controller and the physical
                       bus in a LIN network. Each of its four channels incorporates a LIN transceiver and LIN
                       master termination. According to the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model, this device
                       comprises the LIN physical layer.
                       The TJA1124 is intended for, but not limited to, automotive LIN master applications with
                       multiple LIN master channels. It provides excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
                       performance.
                   6.1 LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 compliance
                       The TJA1124 is fully compliant with LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, ISO
                       17987-4:2016 (12 V LIN) and SAE J2602-1.
                   6.2 Operating modes
                       The TJA1124 supports two main operating modes: Normal mode and Low Power mode.
                       Additional battery supply undervoltage (Off), intermediate VIO undervoltage (VIO UV),
                       intermediate wake-up signalling (Standby) and overtemperature protection (Overtemp)
                       modes are supported. The TJA1124 state diagram is shown in Figure 3.

                        (1) A transition from Low Power mode to Off mode is triggered when VBAT drops below typ. 2.4 V.
                        (2) The SLP input threshold depends on VIO. This mode transition will not take place when
                        VSLP > 0.75VIO.

                                                                                                                   Quad LIN master transceiver
                6.2.1 Off mode
                      When the TJA1124 is in Off mode, all input signals are ignored and all output drivers are
                      off. All pending LIN wake-up event flags are reset. The device is in a defined passive,
                      low-power state in Off mode.
                      The TJA1124 switches to Off mode when the voltage on pin BAT drops below the power-
                      off detection threshold, Vth(det)poff. When the TJA1124 is in Overtemp mode, it switches to
                      Off mode when the junction temperature drops below Trel(otp).
                6.2.2 Low Power mode
                      The TJA1124 consumes significantly less power in Low Power mode than in Normal
                      mode. While current consumption is very low in Low Power mode, the TJA1124 can
                      still detect remote wake-up events on pins LINx (see Section 6.3.1) and microcontroller
                      wake-up events on pin SLP (see Section 6.3.2).
                      Pin INHN is set floating when the TJA1124 switches to Low Power mode.
                      A HIGH level on pin SLP in Normal mode lasting longer than tgotolp(high)SLP initiates a
                      transition to Low Power mode. The LIN transmit path is disabled when pin SLP is HIGH.
                      The transition to Low Power mode takes up to td(lp).
                      The TJA1124 switches from VIO UV mode to Low Power mode if the voltage on pin VIO
                      remains below Vuvd(VIO) for longer than td(uvd-lp).
                6.2.3 Standby mode
                      In Standby mode, the LIN transmitter is off and the INHN output is LOW. The TJA1124
                      switches from Low Power mode to Standby mode when a remote wake-up is detected
                      on one or more of the LIN pins (LIN1 to LIN4). The source(s) of a wake-up event(s) is
                      indicated to the microcontroller by a LOW level on the respective RXD pin(s) (RXD1 to
                      RXD4).
                      The remaining LIN channels are still able to detect remote wake-up events during and
                      after the transition to Standby mode. The transition to Standby mode takes tinit.
                      The TJA1124 switches from VIO UV mode to Standby mode when the voltage on pin VIO
                      remains above Vuvr(VIO) for longer than td(uvr) and pin SLP is HIGH.
                6.2.4 Normal mode
                      The TJA1124 can transmit and receive data via the LIN bus in Normal mode.
                      The receiver detects a data stream on a LIN bus input pin (LIN1 to LIN4) and transfers it
                      to the microcontroller via the associated RXD pin (RXD1 to RXD4): HIGH for a recessive
                      level and LOW for a dominant level on the bus. The receiver has a supply-voltage related
                      threshold with hysteresis and an integrated filter to suppress bus line noise.
                      The transmitter converts a transmit data stream, received from the protocol controller
                      and detected on pin TXDx, into optimized bus signals. The optimized bus signals are
                      shaped to minimize EME. The LINx bus output pin is pulled HIGH via an internal master
                      termination resistor.
                      If pin SLP is pulled LOW for longer than twake(low)SLP while the TJA1124 is in Low Power
                      or Standby mode, the LIN transceiver switches to Normal mode. The transition to Normal
                      mode from Low Power or Off modes takes tinit.

                                                                                                                                Quad LIN master transceiver
                         The TJA1124 switches from VIO UV mode to Normal mode when the voltage on pin VIO
                         remains above Vuvr(VIO) for longer than td(uvr) and pin SLP is LOW.
                 6.2.5 VIO UV mode
                         In VIO UV mode, the LINx outputs are recessive, the INHN output is LOW, the RXDx
                         outputs are HIGH, and the digital inputs are ignored.
                         The TJA1124 switches from Normal or Standby mode to VIO UV mode when the voltage
                         on pin VIO drops below the VIO undervoltage detection threshold, Vuvd(VIO), for longer
                         than td(uvd).
                 6.2.6 Overtemp mode
                         Overtemp mode prevents the TJA1124 from being damaged by excessive temperatures.
                         If the junction temperature exceeds the shutdown threshold, Tsd(otp), the thermal
                         protection circuit disables the LIN channel output drivers and the LIN master pull-up
                         resistors (see Section 6.8) and pending wake-up events are cleared.
                   6.3 Device wake-up
                 6.3.1 Remote wake-up via the LIN bus
                         The TJA1124 can detect remote LIN wake-up events in Low Power and Standby modes.
                         A falling edge on pin LINx followed by a dominant level maintained for twake(dom)LIN,
                         followed by a recessive level, is regarded as a remote wake-up request. The detection of
                         a remote LIN wake-up event is signaled on pin RXDx (see Figure 4 and Figure 5).

 Figure 5. Principle of remote wake-up via LIN bus in Standby mode
                 6.3.2 Local wake-up via pin SLP
                         A LOW level on pin SLP lasting at least twake(low)SLP is interpreted as a local wake-up
                         request.
                   6.4 Operation during automotive cranking pulses
                         The TJA1124 remains fully operational during automotive cranking pulses because it is
                         specified down to VBAT = 5 V.
                   6.5 Operation when supply voltage is outside specified operating range
                         If VBAT > 28 V or VBAT < 5 V, the TJA1124 may remain operational, but parameter values
                         (as specified in Table 5 and Table 6) cannot be guaranteed.
                         If the voltage on pin BAT drops below the power-off detection threshold, Vth(det)poff, the
                         TJA1124 switches to Off mode (see Section 6.2.1).
                         In Normal mode:
                         • If the input level on pin LINx is recessive, the respective receiver output on pin RXDx
                            will be HIGH.
                         • If the input level on pin TXDx is HIGH, the respective LIN transmitter ouput on pin LINx
                            will be recessive.
                   6.6 TXD dominant time-out function
                         Once a transmitter has been enabled, its TXD dominant timeout timer is started every
                         time the associated TXD pin goes LOW. If the LOW state on TXDx persists for longer
                         than the TXD dominant timeout time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the
                         bus line to recessive state. The TXD dominant timeout timer is reset when pin TXDx goes
                         HIGH.

                   6.7 LIN dominant timeout function
                          Each LIN channel has an associated LIN dominant timeout function. This function
                          switches off the LIN master termination resistor, Rmaster or Rmaster(lp), if the LIN bus level
                          remains dominant for longer than tto(dom)LIN. LIN termination resistor Rslave remains active
                          as pull-up when Rmaster or Rmaster(lp) is switched off.
                          Once the LIN bus level is recessive again, the LIN master termination is switched on and
                          the LIN dominant timeout timer is reset.
                   6.8 LIN master pull-up
                          In Normal and Standby modes, the integrated LIN master termination, Rmaster, is a
                          trimmed 1 kΩ pull-up with a tolerance of ±10 %.
                          In Low Power mode, the integrated LIN pull-up depends on the TJA1124 variant. In
                          the TJA1124A, an untrimmed LIN master termination, Rmaster(lp), is enabled. In the
                          TJA1124B, LIN master termination is disabled and the LINx pins are terminated with the
                          LIN termination resistor, Rslave.
                   6.9 Fail-safe features
                          A loss of power (pin BAT or GND) has no impact on the bus lines or on the
                          microcontroller interface pins. When the battery supply is lost, reverse current
                          IBUS_NO_BAT flows from the bus into pins LINx. When the ground connection is lost,
                          current IBUS_NO_GND continues to flow from BAT to LINx via an integrated LIN termination
                          resistor, Rslave. The current path through the LIN master termination is disabled.
                          The output drivers on the LINx pins are protected against overtemperature conditions
                          (see Section 6.2.6).

15 Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached
                     to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides
                     both the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method
                     that is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole
                     and Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is
                     not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming
                     from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the
                     following:
                     • Through-hole components
                     • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                     • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                     • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                     • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                     • Package placement
                     • Inspection and repair
                     • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                15.4 Reflow soldering
                       Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                         higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 9) than a SnPb process, thus reducing
                         the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                         window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board
                         is heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                         temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder
                         paste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                         packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                         depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with Table 8
                         and Table 9.
