1. Below 5 V on VBB in normal mode, the bus will either stay recessive or comply with the voltage level specifications and transition time
    specifications as required by SAE J2602. It is ensured by the battery monitoring circuit.
2. The applied transients shall be in accordance with ISO 7637 part 1, test pulse 5. The device complies with functional class C; class A can
    be reached depending on the application and external conditions.
3. Thermal aspects of the entire end−application have to be taken into account in order to avoid thermal shutdown of NCV7420.
4. VCC voltage regulator output must be properly decoupled by external capacitor of min. 8 mF with ESR < 1 W to ensure stability.
