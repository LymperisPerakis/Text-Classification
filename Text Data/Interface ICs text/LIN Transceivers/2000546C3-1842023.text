Table 1-1.
1.3.1         POWER-DOWN MODE
In Power-Down mode, everything is off except the
wake-up section. The internal 30 k pull-up resistor
switch is open, which enables the high ohmic pull-up
resistor (900 k typical). This is the lowest power
mode. The receiver is off, thus its output is open-drain.
On CS going to a high level or a falling edge on WAKE,
the device will enter Ready mode as soon as internal
voltage stabilizes. Refer to Section 2.4 “AC
Specifications” for further information. In addition, LIN
bus activity will change the device from Power-Down
mode to Ready mode; The MCP2003B wakes up on a
rising edge on LBUS preceded by a low level lasting at
least 70 µs typically. See Figure 1-2 about remote
wake-up. If CS is held high as the device transitions
from Power-Down to Ready mode, the device will
transition to either Operation or Transmitter Off mode,
depending on TXD input, as soon as internal voltages
stabilize.
1.3.2        READY MODE
Transitioning from POR into Ready mode is achieved
when VBB > VBBUV_RISE. Upon entering Ready mode,
VREN is enabled and the receiver detect circuit is
powered-up. The transmitter remains disabled and the
device is ready to receive data but not to transmit.
Upon VBB supply pin power-on, the device will remain
in Ready mode as long as CS is low. When CS
transitions high, the device will either enter Operation
mode if the TXD pin is held high, or the device will enter
Transmitter Off mode if the TXD pin is held low.
1.3.3        OPERATION MODE
In this mode, all internal modules are operational. Note
that the part cannot transmit if the pull-up resistance is
missing on RX pin. See Section 1.5.1.1 “RXD
Monitoring” for details.
The device will go into Power-Down mode on the falling
edge of CS and the TXD pin is held high. The device will
enter Transmitter Off mode in the event of a Fault con-
dition such as thermal overload, bus contention or TXD
timer expiration.
The VBB to LBUS ~30 kΩ pull-up resistor (RSLAVE) is
connected only in Operation mode.
1.3.4        TRANSMITTER OFF MODE
Transmitter Off mode is reached whenever the
transmitter is disabled due to a Fault condition. Fault
conditions include thermal overload, bus contention,
RXD monitoring and TXD timer expiration.

1.5.4.1        TXD Dominant Timeout
If TXD is driven low for longer than approximately
25 ms, the LBUS pin is switched to Recessive mode and
the part enters TOFF Mode. This is to prevent the LIN
node from permanently driving the LIN Bus dominant.
The transmitter is reenabled on TXD rising edge.
1.5.5        GROUND (VSS)
This is the Ground pin.
1.5.6        LIN BUS (LBUS)
The bidirectional LIN Bus pin (LBUS) is controlled by the
TXD input. LBUS has a current limited open collector
output. To reduce EMI, the edges during the signal
changes are slope controlled and include corner
rounding control for both falling and rising edges.
The internal LIN receiver observes the activities on the
LIN bus, and matches the output signal RXD to follow
the state of the LBUS pin.
1.5.6.1        Bus Dominant Timer
The Bus Dominant Timer is an internal timer that
deactivates the LBUS transmitter after approximately
25 ms of dominant state on the LBUS pin. The timer is
reset on any recessive LBUS state.
The LIN bus transmitter will be reenabled after a
recessive state on the LBUS pin as long as CS is high.
Disabling can be caused by the LIN bus being
externally held dominant, or by TXD being driven low.
1.5.7        BATTERY (VBB)
This is the Battery Positive Supply Voltage pin.
1.5.8        VOLTAGE REGULATOR ENABLE
             OUTPUT (VREN)
This is the External Voltage Regulator Enable pin.
Open-drain output is pulled high to VBB in all modes
except Power-Down.
1.5.9        EXPOSED THERMAL PAD (EP)
Do not electrically connect, or connect to VSS.

 Note 1:    The maximum power dissipation is a function of TJMAX, JA and ambient temperature TA. The maximum
            allowable power dissipation at an ambient temperature is PD = (TJMAX - TA)JA. If this dissipation is
            exceeded, the die temperature will rise above 150C and the device will go into thermal shutdown.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
