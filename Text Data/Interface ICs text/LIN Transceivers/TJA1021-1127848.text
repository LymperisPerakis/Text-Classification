1. General description
              The TJA1021 is the interface between the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) master/slave
              protocol controller and the physical bus in a LIN. It is primarily intended for in-vehicle
              sub-networks using baud rates from 1 kBd up to 20 kBd (/20 variant) and is compliant with
              LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, SAE J2602 and ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V). The
              TJA1021 is pin-to-pin compatible with the TJA1020 and MC33662(B).
              The transmit data stream of the protocol controller at the transmit data input (TXD) is
              converted by the TJA1021 into a bus signal with optimized slew rate and wave shaping to
              minimize ElectroMagnetic Emission (EME). The LIN bus output pin is pulled HIGH via an
              internal termination resistor. For a master application, an external resistor in series with a
              diode should be connected between pin INH or pin VBAT and pin LIN. The receiver detects
              the data stream at the LIN bus input pin and transfers it via pin RXD to the microcontroller.
              In Sleep mode, the power consumption of the TJA1021 is very low. In failure modes, the
              power consumption is reduced to a minimum.

7. Functional description
                               The TJA1021 is the interface between the LIN master/slave protocol controller and the
                               physical bus in a Local Interconnect Network (LIN). The TJA1021 is LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1,
                               LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, SAE J2602 and ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V) compliant and provides
                               optimum ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance due to wave shaping of the
                               LIN output.
                               The LIN physical layer is independent of higher OSI model layers (e.g., the LIN protocol).
                               Consequently, nodes containing an ISO 17987-compliant physical layer can be combined,
                               without restriction, with LIN physical layer nodes that comply with earlier revisions
                               (LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3, LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 and LIN 2.2A).
                               The TJA1021T/20 and TJA1021TK/20 are optimized for the maximum specified LIN
                               transmission speed of 20 kBd; the TJA1021T/10 and TJA1021TK/10 are optimized for the
                               LIN transmission speed of 10.4 kBd as specified by the SAE J2602.
                       7.1 Operating modes
                               The TJA1021 supports modes for normal operation (Normal mode), power-up (Power-on
                               mode) and very-low-power operation (Sleep mode). An intermediate wake-up mode
                               between Sleep and Normal modes is also supported (Standby mode). Figure 3 shows the
                               state diagram.

                   7.2 Sleep mode
                       This mode is the most power-saving mode of the TJA1021. Despite its extreme low
                       current consumption, the TJA1021 can still be woken up remotely via pin LIN, or woken
                       up locally via pin WAKE_N, or activated directly via pin SLP_N. Filters at the inputs of the
                       receiver (LIN), of pin WAKE_N and of pin SLP_N prevent unwanted wake-up events due
                       to automotive transients or EMI. All wake-up events must be maintained for a certain time
                       period (twake(dom)LIN, twake(dom)WAKE_N and tgotonorm).
                       Sleep mode is initiated by a falling edge on pin SLP_N in Normal mode. To enter Sleep
                       mode successfully (INH becomes floating), the sleep command (pin SLP_N = LOW) must
                       be maintained for at least tgotosleep.
                       In Sleep mode the internal slave termination between pins LIN and VBAT is disabled to
                       minimize the power dissipation in the event that pin LIN is short-circuited to ground. Only
                       a weak pull-up between pins LIN and VBAT is present.
                       Sleep mode can be activated independently from the actual level on pin LIN, pin TXD or
                       pin WAKE_N. This guarantees that the lowest power consumption is achievable even in

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                            TJA1021
                                                                                                        ISO 17987/LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 transceiver
                       When VBAT drops below the power-on-reset threshold Vth(POR)L, the TJA1021 enters
                       Sleep mode.
                   7.3 Standby mode
                       Standby mode is entered automatically whenever a local or remote wake-up occurs while
                       the TJA1021 is in Sleep mode. These wake-up events activate pin INH and enable the
                       slave termination resistor at the pin LIN. As a result of the HIGH condition on pin INH the
                       voltage regulator and the microcontroller can be activated.
                       Standby mode is signalled by a LOW-level on pin RXD which can be used as an interrupt
                       for the microcontroller.
                       In Standby mode (pin SLP_N is still LOW), the condition of pin TXD (weak pull-down or
                       strong pull-down) indicates the wake-up source: weak pull-down for a remote wake-up
                       request and strong pull-down for a local wake-up request.
                       Setting pin SLP_N HIGH during Standby mode results in the following events:
                         • An immediate reset of the wake-up source flag; thus releasing the possible strong
                            pull-down at pin TXD before the actual mode change (after tgotonorm) is performed
                         • A change into Normal mode if the HIGH level on pin SLP_N has been maintained for
                            a certain time period (tgotonorm)
                         • An immediate reset of the wake-up request signal on pin RXD
                   7.4 Normal mode
                       In Normal mode the TJA1021 is able to transmit and receive data via the LIN bus line. The
                       receiver detects the data stream at the LIN bus input pin and transfers it via pin RXD to
                       the microcontroller (see Figure 1): HIGH at a recessive level and LOW at a dominant level
                       on the bus. The receiver has a supply-voltage related threshold with hysteresis and an
                       integrated filter to suppress bus line noise. The transmit data stream of the protocol
                       controller at the TXD input is converted by the transmitter into a bus signal with optimized
                       slew rate and wave shaping to minimize EME. The LIN bus output pin is pulled HIGH via
                       an internal slave termination resistor. For a master application an external resistor in
                       series with a diode should be connected between pin INH or VBAT on one side and pin LIN
                       on the other side (see Figure 7).
                       When in Sleep, Standby or Power-up mode, the TJA1021 enters Normal mode whenever
                       a HIGH level on pin SLP_N is maintained for a time of at least tgotonorm.
                       The TJA1021 switches to Sleep mode in case of a LOW-level on pin SLP_N, maintained
                       for a time of at least tgotosleep.
                   7.5 Wake-up
                       When VBAT exceeds the power-on-reset threshold voltage Vth(POR)H, the TJA1021 enters
                       Power-on mode. Though the TJA1021 is powered-up and INH is HIGH, both the
                       transmitter and receiver are still inactive. If SLP_N = 1 for t > tgotonorm, the TJA1021 enters
                       Normal mode.
                       There are three ways to wake-up a TJA1021 which is in Sleep mode:
                         1. Remote wake-up via a dominant bus state of at least twake(dom)LIN

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                            TJA1021
                                                                                                        ISO 17987/LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 transceiver
                         2. Local wake-up via a negative edge at pin WAKE_N
                         3. Mode change (pin SLP_N is HIGH) from Sleep mode to Normal mode
                   7.6 Remote and local wake-up
                       A falling edge at pin LIN followed by a LOW level maintained for a certain time period
                       (twake(dom)LIN) and a rising edge at pin LIN respectively (see Figure 4) results in a remote
                       wake-up. It should be noted that the time period twake(dom)LIN is measured either in Normal
                       mode while TXD is HIGH, or in Sleep mode irrespective of the status of pin TXD.
                       A falling edge at pin WAKE_N followed by a LOW level maintained for a certain time
                       period (twake(dom)WAKE_N) results in a local wake-up. The pin WAKE_N provides an internal
                       pull-up towards pin VBAT. In order to prevent EMI issues, it is recommended to connect an
                       unused pin WAKE_N to pin VBAT.
                       After a local or remote wake-up, pin INH is activated (it goes HIGH) and the internal slave
                       termination resistor is switched on. The wake-up request is indicated by a LOW active
                       wake-up request signal on pin RXD to interrupt the microcontroller.
                   7.7 Wake-up via mode transition
                       It is also possible to set pin INH HIGH with a mode transition towards Normal mode via pin
                       SLP_N. This is useful for applications with a continuously powered microcontroller.
                   7.8 Wake-up source recognition
                       The TJA1021 can distinguish between a local wake-up request on pin WAKE_N and a
                       remote wake-up request via a dominant bus state. 'A local wake-up request sets the
                       wake-up source flag. The wake-up source can be read on pin TXD in the Standby mode. If
                       an external pull-up resistor on pin TXD to the power supply voltage of the microcontroller
                       has been added, a HIGH level indicates a remote wake-up request (weak pull-down at pin
                       TXD) and a LOW level indicates a local wake-up request (strong pull-down at pin TXD;
                       much stronger than the external pull-up resistor).
                       The wake-up request flag (signalled on pin RXD) as well as the wake-up source flag
                       (signalled on pin TXD) are reset immediately after the microcontroller sets pin SLP_N
                       HIGH.
                   7.9 TXD dominant time-out function
                       A TXD dominant time-out timer circuit prevents the bus line from being driven to a
                       permanent dominant state (blocking all network communication) if pin TXD is forced
                       permanently LOW by a hardware and/or software application failure. The timer is
                       triggered by a negative edge on pin TXD. If the duration of the LOW-level on pin TXD
                       exceeds the internal timer value (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, driving the bus
                       line into a recessive state. The timer is reset by a positive edge on pin TXD.
                7.10 Fail-safe features
                       Pin TXD provides a pull-down to GND in order to force a predefined level on input pin TXD
                       in case the pin TXD is unsupplied.
                       Pin SLP_N provides a pull-down to GND in order to force the transceiver into Sleep mode
                       in case the pin SLP_N is unsupplied.

                   Pin RXD is set floating in case of lost power supply on pin VBAT.
                   The current of the transmitter output stage is limited in order to protect the transmitter
                   against short circuit to pins VBAT or GND.
                   A loss of power (pins VBAT and GND) has no impact on the bus line and the
                   microcontroller. There are no reverse currents from the bus. The LIN transceiver can be
                   disconnected from the power supply without influencing the LIN bus.
                   The output driver at pin LIN is protected against overtemperature conditions. If the
                   junction temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature Tj(sd), the thermal
                   protection circuit disables the output driver. The driver is enabled again when the junction
                   temperature has dropped below Tj(sd) and a recessive level is present at pin TXD.
                   If VBAT drops below Vth(VBATL)L, a protection circuit disables the output driver. The driver is
                   enabled again when VBAT > Vth(VBATL)H and a recessive level is present at pin TXD.
                                                                LIN recessive                                                VBAT

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 10) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 10.
